"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message is urging Nigerians to apply for the 2021 Commonwealth Scholarship to study for free in the UK Even though it is true the Commonwealth is offering fully funded scholarships, findings have revealed that the purported website open for registration is a click bait and the message is misleading. Nigeria is said to be the number one country of origin for international students from Africa. It sends the most students overseas of any country on the African continent, and outbound mobility numbers are growing at a rapid pace. According to data from the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (UIS), the number of Nigerian students abroad increased by 164 percent in the decade between 2005 and 2015 alone from 26,997 to 71,351, At least 40 percent of Nigerian overseas students are said to rely on scholarships. Recently, a viral message on WhatsApp asking Nigerians to apply for the commonwealth fully funded scholarships that will cover full tuition, living expenses, accommodation, medical facilities, travelling allowance, stationery allowance and unlimited work permit, caught attention. The message ended with the provision of a bit.ly link for applicants to apply. *APPLY FOR UNITED KINGDOM SCHOLARSHIP 2021, FULLY FUNDED SCHOLARSHIP TO STUDY FOR FREE IN Uk.* *It takes a few seconds to apply. Dont miss this opportunity.* *Benfits of COMMONWEALTH 2021 scholarship Program.* *The scholarship will cover.* -Full Tuition Fee -Living Allowance -Acoomodation -Medical Facilities -Traveling Allowance -Unlimited Work Permit. *APPLY HERE* bit.ly/UK-FreeScholarships It was first noticed that the message contained several grammatical errors and irregular capitalisation of words. Dubawa clicked on the bit.ly link and it directed this reporter to a new website with a welcome message that reads Study in United Kingdom With Course of Your Choice For Free through-out The years program.The CommonWealth Scholarship Program Enables International Students to Study in United Kingdom Comfortably and Free. Applicants are to fill the form bellow and click on Apply The form requested applicants to fill in their full names, course, email address, country and whether this was their first application. Dubawa filled in fake information, and this writer was led to another website. The new website congratulates the applicant, notifying them that their applications have been received, then it went further to request answers to three questions quickly; 1. Current Level Of Study 2. Age Range 3. State of Interest After answering the questions, a message popped up immediately, that the application has been approved for free and that the applicant should fill the visa application form below. Applicants are then requested to share the link with their friends and groups. Dubawa noticed irregular pop-ups while filling the application form, in addition to excessive ads. Further analysis using Domainbigdata , a web tool used to verify the authenticity of a website, showed that the website has IP geolocation of United States, California, Sun City and it has been reported several times for abuses, fraud, and attacks. It is an agency-nominated masters programme, funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for candidates from eligible lower and upper middle income Commonwealth countries, to undertake full-time taught Masters study at a UK university. These scholarships are offered under six development themes: Dubawa discovered that the commonwealth website looks different from the so-called scholarship website. Applicants must make their application through the Commonwealth Scholarship Commissions (CSC) online application system, in addition to any other application that they are required to complete by their nominating body. The CSC does not accept any applications that are not submitted via the online application system. So first off, applicants must apply to one of the following nominating bodies in the first instance the CSC does not accept direct applications for these scholarships. So each nominating body is responsible for its own selection process and may have additional eligibility criteria. Applicants must check with their nominating body for their specific advice and rules for applying, their own eligibility criteria, and their own closing date for application. Dubawa also observed that the Minimum qualification for the Scholarship is that applicants must be under 40 years of age as of September 1st of the current year, and applicants must hold a Bachelors or Masters degree as of August 31st of the current year for applying for Masters degree or Doctoral degree respectively. Dubawa also saw that the scholarship covers fees, approved fares, and personal maintenance. Other scholarships, awards, or bursaries that cover the same costs may not be held concurrently. Though it is true that the Commonwealth is offering fully funded scholarships, verification has revealed that the so-called website open for registration is a click bait and the message is misleading.

"Claim: A user on Facebook claims China has implanted chicken organs in pigs to make them produce chicken eggs. The image used to support the claim was extracted from a different context and doctored to suit the bogus narrative. This claim is false. When a user on Facebook, Uchenna Dike, shared an image of what he claimed to be pigs laying eggs, alongside the heading: China plants chicken organs in pigs for faster and more eggs production, the comment section of the post became hilarious. Making us to realise; or to understand that some scientific knowledge is purely satanic, i.e. please add chicken-pig egg to my rice, one user, Cyprian Ajunwo, commented. However, some doubts raised by other users stirred some questions. Mammal animals can never lay eggs I still remember that one very well. It is impossible, Asiwaju Olajide Toby, contested. Not entirely surprising, the post garnered over 5000 re-shares and close to over 2000 reactions within just two days of its appearance. Notably, the claimant and the commenters could not point to the actual source of the narrative, as most of the users apparently seem to believe it. The same narrative made headlines on a Ghana-based news website, Vimbuzz: China plants chicken organs in other animals for faster egg production , featuring the same image as the one shared on Facebook. But still, what is the probability of such a great invention taking place? No doubt, great scientific and technological inventions have been referenced to the Chinese and in the past also, the world has witnessed great revolutions in different areas, yet, the claim that pigs are genetically modified to lay eggs seems to be a question that requires more answers than the one that already meets the eyes. When a Yandex reverse image search was conducted on the alleged image, the results showed the image was taken out of context and manipulated to cast a new and bogus narrative around it. Originally, the alleged image appeared on a Ukrainian agricultural promotion website . The image was used, along with a post that was promoting common individuals to venture into cattle ranching. Apparently noticeable is that even the alleged pigs, as initially claimed in the image, were actually a group of ranch cows. This is not the first time the image was used to spread false claims. In 2018, a Ukrainian-based news site, Top news debunked a claim that used the image of the cows to allege that cancer was implanted in cows to boost their growth. Pigs or mammals can not lay eggs. The possibility is just not feasible, Dr Jeremiah Milon, chief veterinarian at Animal first, said. Also, according to Scientific American, Only two kinds of egg-laying mammals are left on the planet todaythe duck-billed platypus and the echidna, or spiny anteater. These odd monotremes once dominated Australia, until their pouch-bearing cousins, the marsupials, invaded the land over 71 million to 54 million years ago and swept them away. New research suggests these two kinds of creatures managed to survive because their ancestors took to the water. Pigs can not lay eggs and mammals in general cannot. DUBAWA has uncovered that the image used to spread the alleged narrative was doctored. This claim is false. This fact-check was produced by DUBAWA in partnership with Code for Africas PesaCheck, with support from ICFJ.",0

"Claim: Some Facebook users shared an image alleging that Yahaya Bello jumped over a gate to escape EFCCs detention. Verdict: False! The circulating image on social media was altered, with the former governors head digitally added to the original photo. Yahaya Bello, a prominent figure in Nigerian politics, served as the governor of Kogi State from 2016 to 2024, representing the All Progressives Congress (APC). Notably, he held the distinction of being the youngest governor in the country during his tenure. His political journey began with a setback in the 2015 APC gubernatorial primary, where he lost to Abubakar Audu, who went on to win the elections but passed away on election day, leading to Mr Bellos selection as his replacement and subsequent inauguration as governor the following year. In March 2024, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) levied allegations against Bello, accusing him of financial fraud amounting to over N80 billion. Despite scheduled arraignments at the Federal High Court in Abuja, Mr Bello failed to appear, prompting the EFCC to issue a public notice declaring him wanted. Subsequently, numerous controversies and rumours have emerged regarding the former governors status, including speculation about his arrest. DUBAWA has fact-checked some of the claims . However, new ones emerge. Recently, DUBAWA traced Facebook accounts that shared another narrative about Mr Bellos escape from the EFCC. One such account belonged to a Facebook user named Christopher Emmanuel , who shared a post on April 19, 2024, around 5:00 pm, stating, Disgrace. Honourable Yahaya Bello was seen climbing and crossing the fence. Another user, Onyukwu Oge, expressed, See Yahaya Bello jumping through the fence to escape arrest by the EFCC. How are the mighty being disgraced? Who would ever believe that this bastard can bring himself this low as to climb the fence as his escape route? In the comment section, several individuals commented that Yahaya Bello jumped a fence to evade the EFCC. Omale Ahmed commented, Very stupid man, while Jonah Emmanuel replied, He has not seen anything yet. Its just the beginning, and he should better surrender himself on a low key rather than deceiving himself because he cant run anywhere. He better go and surrender because all eyes are on him because 84 billion is not a joke. Mfon Williams also added, Yahaya Bello, you cant escape. Imagine a disgrace. Immediate past Executive Governor of a state, jumping the fence to escape the law. Didnt anyone inform him that the Code of Conducts Bureau CCB was still effective in Nigeria? Bello or whatever you are called, respect yourself and turn up. If you are jumping a fence, what will your children jump? You must be apprehended. Additionally, several other Facebook users shared the same claim, corroborating the narrative. See here , here , here , here , and here . While acknowledging the necessity for the law to take its course amidst the controversy, DUBAWA endeavoured to verify the validity of this claim. Upon examining the shared image, several discrepancies emerged. Notably, the face and body of the person crossing over the fence were oddly discoloured, and there was a noticeable misalignment between them. Furthermore, the expression on the face appeared unusually calm. Utilising Google Lens on the circulated photo, DUBAWA was redirected to a news report by Infostride featuring the same image of a gate with three individuals attempting to scale it. The report highlighted the blockade of the National Assembly, orchestrated by the police to prevent the speaker of the House of Representatives nine years ago, Aminu Tambuwal, from entering the assembly complex. Another report uncovered the original photo of the individual who scaled the gate not to be Bello. Additionally, the police force shared a report by Channels TV on November 21, 2014, condemning the actions of APC lawmakers who jumped over the gate to enter the National Assembly in Abuja on November 20, 2014. This suggests that the image in question was an old one that was repurposed to depict the recent incident involving the former governor of Kogi State. So, who is depicted in the image? The actual individual seen scaling the gate is identified as Usman Cheche . Real image of Usman Cheche on November 20, 2014, forcefully crossing over the National Assembly gate. Cheche , a representative of the Bida-Gbako-Katcha federal constituency of Niger State, served in the Nigerian House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015. In November 2014, Cheche and other members of the House resorted to climbing the gate of the National Assembly complex after being denied entry by the police. It appears that Mr Bellos face was superimposed onto the original photo of Cheche scaling the gate. While it is true that the EFCC has declared Mr Bello wanted for financial fraud, the claim that he was seen jumping a fence to escape being caught by operatives is false. DUBAWAs search revealed that the image circulating was old and had been altered to misinform people.

"CLAIM: A Twitter user, Chinaza #PeterObi-HypeMan (@MuchTalksBlog1), claims that Wasiu Ayinde, Nigerian Fuji singer, was among the thugs who came to disrupt the election on Saturday. FINDING: The one-minute-long video the claimant shared did not show that the Fuji singer was present at the location. Additionally, no reports from any credible media platform suggest or disclose Mr Ayindes role in ballot snatching during yesterdays election. Reacting to the allegation, Kunle Rasheed, the singers spokesperson, debunked the claims on his Facebook page, reiterating that Mr Ayinde will never partake in such an act nor endorse it. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCE: OSINT, Mr Ayindes spokesperson DATE: 19/03/2023",1
"Claim: A WhatsApp message with a shortened url link directs Nigerians to apply for the Federal Government Jubilee Fellowship in 2021. While it is true that the Federal Government is organising a Jubilee Fellowship Programme, the link in the shared message is not from the government, the fellowship is open only to Nigerians and the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) has not stated any specific amount as stipend. Unemployment is a global issue, but in a country with a high youth population like Nigeria , unemployment can be a serious source of concern. Bloomberg estimates that the unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 33% in the last quarter of 2020. The Federal Government has been making efforts to curb this challenge with various employment and empowerment schemes for its young citizens like the N-Power programme. In September 2021, a message with the information that the Federal Government had opened a portal for graduates to apply for the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) was shared on WhatsApp. The message states that the programme is also open to foreigners from Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Cameroon and that fellows will be paid 80,500 monthly and urges them to apply now. The message then provided a link for applicants to apply for the scheme. Members of the WhatsApp group on which the message was shared expressed their reservations that the message might be false due to past experiences and Dubawa, therefore, decided to fact-check the claim. The Nigerian Government is partnering with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the European Union (EU) to provide employment to 20,000 young Nigerian graduates under the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP). The government claims that unlike other similar initiatives that tend to require some sort of advanced requirement from applicants or lower the entry bar in terms of the kind of opportunities that are available, the NJFP does the opposite by inviting qualified applicants across a level playing field without compromising the pedigree of organizations that will play host to successful Fellows. The programme also promises to place fellows in private and public sector organisations across various industries. While Nigerians are excited about the opportunities, many are nonetheless wary as they have been deceived previously by offers of fraudulent schemes or those purportedly from the government. In June 2021, a viral WhatsApp message claimed the Federal Government was distributing 200,000 grants to businesses while another phishing website (in December, 2020) claimed the Federal Government was recruiting 50,000 youths while yet another (in November, 2020) claimed the Federal Government was giving grants to support Nigerians . Dubawa clicked on the phishing/fraudulent website- https://tinyurl.com/Apply-FG-Jubilee-Programme severally without success. Dubawa then verified the Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) website and also sought information through Villa Updates, a verified Telegram platform of the Nigerian Governments State House where information is shared to citizens. Villa Updates on Telegram has close to 44,000 subscribers. Villa Update shared a message on September 14, 2021, confirming the information that applications have opened for the President Buhari launched Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme and that applications will close on October 20, 2021. The message also states that the application process does not charge a fee at any stage of the application or work placement process. It, therefore, discourages applicants from applying through fraudulent websites and advises them to apply through the website for the programme: www.njfp.ng . The disclaimer was also shared online . The Nigeria Jubilee Fellows Programme (NJFP) is real but applicants should only apply through the verified website which is www.njfp.ng The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with WikkiTimes to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"In the first week of April, we came across several claims online and questions posed to the DUBAWA chatbot. Below is a listicle of the top and trending claims investigated by DUBAWA during the week. Earlier in the month, 16 travellers alleged to be kidnappers were lynched after they were found with local guns and machetes. This incident generated controversy across various social media, with users expressing fear of a possible reprisal attack on the Igbo people. In light of this, a claim started circulating across Facebook and other social media platforms that the Northerners had attacked a bus conveying Igbo travellers from Kano State. DUBAWA investigated the claim, which was shared alongside images of a burning vehicle. Our findings revealed that the image was unrelated to the Edo lynching and was not as recent as claimed. A Facebook user, Abdulrahman Shakundum , via video, claimed that there was an assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in his car. The claim started spreading a few days into the negotiation plan between the warring countries, Russia and Ukraine, initiated by the United States government. DUBAWAs i nvestigation confirmed the incident, revealing this is not the first assassination attempt on Putin. A Facebook user shared a post claiming that Wike collapsed during a meeting in Abuja due to excess alcohol intake. The user asserted the claim with three pictures, allegedly showing scenes from the collapse of the FCT minister in Abuja. As gathered by DUBAWA, this was not the first time the former River State governor has been accused of excessive alcohol intake. DUBAWA noticed the incredulous nature of the claim and the level of engagement it attracted, so we decided to investigate it. Our findings revealed that the three images shared by the claimant are old and unrelated to the Ministers alleged health. Furthermore, the media aide to the FCT minister, Lere Olayinka, has refuted the circulating claim, describing it as false and misleading. On Mar. 25, 2025, a Facebook user uploaded an image of PDPs Acting National Chairperson, Umar Damagum, claiming his resignation. Many users found the claim convincing, as it was allegedly sourced from Arise News, a broadcast station in Nigeria. DUBAWA r esearch led us to several reports by credible media outlets debunking the claim about the resignation of the acting PDP National Chairperson as false. Meanwhile, the party has dismissed the claim as politically motivated, urging the public to disregard the malicious information. Therefore, the claim is false.",1
"Claim: Facebook users shared a picture of a letter alleging that the current speaker of the Lagos state House of Assembly, Mojisola Meranda, has resigned. Verdict: FALSE. No credible media organisation reported such an occurrence. Also, the assemblys information officer, Bisola Branco-Adekoya, debunked the claim. The internal battle at the Lagos state legislative house reached a crescendo on Jan. 13, 2025, when members impeached the long-serving speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, over allegations of gross misconduct and abuse of office. His deputy, Mojisola Meranda, was chosen by the assemblys majority to succeed him while he was in the United States. Since then, the hallowed chambers have experienced various turmoils. The latest controversy was the premises invasion by officials of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Police, who sealed the offices of the Speaker, her deputy, and the clerk. On Feb. 17, 2025, Lagos State House of Assembly members responded by passing a vote of confidence in Meranda, affirming their trust in her leadership. However, alleged news of her resignation suddenly surfaced online, as depicted in a letter attributed to the 44-year-old lawmaker representing Apapa Constituency 1. A Facebook page, Nigeria News Now that shared the letter gained 11 reactions, 11 comments, and three reshares in seven hours. However, the claim gained more reactions here , here , and here . The informations implications for the newly elected speakers reputation and the stability of the Assembly prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA conducted an advanced keyword search and found no credible media report on the alleged incident. We also contacted Folashade Ogunrinde, a Premium Times reporter covering the South West. She contacted the assemblys chief public affairs officer, Bisola Branco-Adekoya, who described the claim as false. DUBAWA attempted to contact Ms Branco-Adekoya through WhatsApp messages and calls, but she did not respond when the report was filed. We identified several discrepancies when we manually analysed the document, casting doubt on its credibility. Publicly accessible documents from public officeholders like governors and speakers bear the writers appended signature. However, the viral letter has none, though the officials initials and contact details were added. The insignia on the document also had Office of the Speaker written around the states coat of arms. This differed from the insignia in the speakers office , which reads, Office of the Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly. The words completely circled the legislative houses emblem, a hand holding the mace with the states Coat of Arms at the head. After carefully comparing the viral letter with logos associated with Lagos state government officials, DUBAWA discovered that the false documents insignia was a manipulated form of the governors version. Information from credible sources and manual analyses revealed that the viral letter was manipulated. It is a mischievous attempt to depict the speaker bowing to pressure falsely.",0
"Claim: A social media user posted a picture claiming to be the recent picture of Bobrisky in the detention facility of Nigerias Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC). Verdict: Misleading! Our findings reveal that the picture has been online since 2017. Following the controversial arrest of Idris Okuneye, better known as Bobrisky, on April 4 by Nigerias Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for currency mutilation and abuse of naira, a plethora of public opinions and assertions have continued to trail the action of the agency. One such is a picture by a Facebook user, Abdullah Ayofe Liberator, depicting Bobriskys poor condition not long after his arrest. He captioned it: Nigeria prison is not where anyone should go. Guess who is in the picture? As of Wednesday, April 11th, 2024, the post had generated over 47 likes and 13 comments and had been shared twice. While some comments under the post doubt the recency of the image, others question its veracity. Alabi Wahab commented, Its an old picture of Bobrisky. John Jolaosho wrote, Pray you shouldnt have been a victim. Lawal Muhammed Kabiru questioned, Is this real brother? DUBAWA monitored the post and saw that several users on Facebook posted it with the same caption here and here . It has also been circulated widely on X (formerly Twitter). DUBAWA conducted this fact-check report due to the evident disagreement over the post. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search and discovered the photo has been online since 2017. An earlier version of the picture came with a report of Bobrisky in police custody after he was arrested following a petition written against him by serial entrepreneur Toyin Lawani that he stole her customers. DUBAWA also found several platforms that have reported the incident using the same picture. We observed that the watermark on it, IBNaija, is also on the earlier version of it when it first surfaced on social media. The claim is misleading, as the picture is connected to a 2017 arrest of the controversial crossdresser.",0
"Claim: A Facebook video shows a man alleging that Michelle Obama is a man. Verdict: FALSE! The pictures used to portray her as masculine are fake, and the video of her husband calling her Micheal was taken out of context. First Lady Michelle Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th American President, Barack Obama. She is the pioneer African-American First Lady of the United States. Ms Obama is well known as an advocate for healthy families , service members families, higher education , and international adolescent girls education. A Facebook user, Songasmangit Alkebulan , posted a video of a man saying that Ms Obama is transgender and that her real name is Micheal. He captioned the video with: Obama accidentally exposing himself and Michelle (Michael), as a transgender, the last woman saying Michelle was a trans was found murdered lately, we are in the age of hidden agenda exposed. In the almost two-minute video , different pictures and videos showed significant differences in Ms Obamas body. The song in the background said, How come anyone notices her private parts in her pictures. The video that has gone viral has garnered 3,300 likes and 1,900 shares since it was posted. The virality of this post and the personalities involved made us run a fact check. We did an advanced Google search and saw that the claim is recurring. It was first posted on August 18, 2018, when Mr Obama was running for president of the United States. The post also shows a video of Mr Obama making a speech at the Change of Office Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Ceremony, where he said Micheal and I. We watched the video from the beginning and saw that he was referring to Micheal, an admiral present at the ceremony. In the transcripted version of the video on the official website of Mr Obama, he said, Most of all, Admiral Mullen, Deborah, Michael, and I also want to acknowledge your son Jack, whos deployed today. This shows that the video was taken out of context. We also found out that all the videos used to depict the masculinity of Ms Obama were edited using the image of men. The actual pictures of Ms Obama are in the Barack Obama Presidential Library . The post shared on Facebook, which said that the woman that said Michelle was trans died mysteriously, is false. Our investigation shows that the woman was Joan Rivers and died of low blood oxygen during a routine medical procedure to check out voice changes and reflux. Our findings show that Ms Obama is not transgender; all the pictures used to portray her as one are fake. We also discovered that the video of her husband calling her Micheal was taken out of context.",0
"Claim: An X user claimed that over 70 per cent of Nigerias population is illiterate. Verdict: False! The most recent data from the Ministry of Education puts the estimated number of non-literate Nigerians at 31 per cent. Amidst the ongoing feud between Senator Natasha Apoti and Godswill Akpabio, the Senate President, a video emerged on social media, showing a group of women in Kogi state purportedly gathered in an attempt to recall Senator Natasha. While tweeting his opinion about the incident, Shehu Sadiq , an X user, said the women in the video were illiterate. Sadiq ascribed the failure of democracy to mass illiteracy and poverty and also claimed that over 70 per cent of Nigerians are illiterate. Sadiqs post generated heated debates among other users. While some argue differently, several others, like @UchennaObi36947 , wrote: I agree with you, my good friend, but you must know too that exposure is part of education, and 90% of the northern populace are not exposed, and 70% of the 70% of Nigeria illiterates you mentioned are northerners too. @brenokwaraji , another user, said the figure was higher: 90% actually. Some PhD holders are also in this category, he responded. DUBAWA conducted this verification to ease the brewing controversy and set the record straight. Illiteracy is not just about not being able to read and write. It is often a result of deeper issues like poor access to education, harsh living conditions, and a lack of exposure to reading early on. Poverty makes it worse, and social factors like gender, ethnicity, and class also make things even harder. A 2022 estimation released by the Federal Ministry of Education pegs Nigerias current illiteracy level at 31 per cent. As of 2025, the media and Federal Government are still using this data because no other recent data is available. On the other hand, Nigerias literacy rate is 69%, which, according to development aid , is a 17% increase over the last 15 years. While these data may be too old to show the actual realities in the Nigerian society of today, they remain what is available. Data showing literacy and illiteracy rates in Nigeria. Source: Dataphyte. The claim that over 70% of Nigerians are illiterate is false. The most recent data from the Ministry of Education puts the estimated figure at 31%.",0
"Claim: An X user (formerly Twitter) shared an image alleging that Boko Haram recently abducted some Nigerians in Abia State. Verdict: The image, dated July 13, 2014, shows Boko Harams Abubakar Shekau pledging allegiance to the Islamic State and not an attack on Abia State. This renders the claim false. The issue of Boko Haram has been a persistent case in Nigeria. The operations of this terrorist group, which gained widespread notoriety in 2009, have caused the abduction of people and the loss of many lives. Misinformation has not been far from this, as many false narratives have been shared claiming certain activities by the group. See some samples of claims fact-checked by DUBAWA here , here , here , and here . A post shared on June 3, 2024, features a photo of armed individuals dressed in military fatigues, with military vehicles in the background. The individual in the foreground is holding a blank sheet of paper, appearing to read a statement. The text accompanying the image, which was initially written in French, reads, Nigeria / Vingt militaires et 71 civils ont t tus et 190 personnes kidnappes dans une attaque du groupe #Boko Haram contre le poste de contrle dAba dans ltat dAbia. This translates to, Nigeria / Twenty military personnel and 71 civilians killed and 190 kidnapped in Boko Haram attack on Aba checkpoint in Abia State (). At the time, the post had 13,900 views, 23 comments, 35 shares, 218 likes, and four bookmarks. Many people in the comments seemed to affirm what the post asserted. @SamajesteTP, for instance, said: Its shameful for Nigeria! Unable to get rid of Boko Haram but wants to go to war with Niger! Africa has an incredible talent! @Marilyn_Sidis added: A country that is not strong enough cannot control all its territory, and if a country cannot control all its territory, there will always be rebels or terrorists who will cowardly take the lives of innocent people. Can Nigeria control all its space? DUBAWA decided to verify the claims authenticity as part of its mandate to combat misinformation. A reverse image search with Google Lens points to this article , published on September 29, 2014, titled Deadly Boko Haram assault in Mainok, northern Nigeria. The article published along with the photo of the claim came with the following caption: In this video released by Boko Haram on July 13, the groups leader, Abubakar Shekau, pledges allegiance to ISIS. Members of the Islamist movement Boko Haram attacked the market in the town of Mainok in northe ast Nigeria on Friday, September 19. They evaded a crowded market in the middle of the day, killing many people. This other article , posted online on March 7, 2015, reports the same information and includes Abubakar Shekau s allegiance video . According to revelations from DUBAWAs investigations in the preceding paragraphs, the X post with an image claiming to show a Boko Haram attack on a checkpoint in Nigeria in 2024 is false. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Prime Progress, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A viral video making rounds on social media claims that Boko Haram is forcefully converting commuters in Niger State in Nigeria into islam The viral claim that Boko Haram is forcefully converting commuters in Niger State of Nigeria is false. Shreds of evidence showed that the purported event actually took place in Kolia, Ivory Coast, during a crusade that was hosted by a certain female cleric. Hence, the video was taken out of its original context to paint a different narrative. One topical security issue that has dominated news over the past weeks is the announced presence of Boko Haram in a number of communities in Niger State. This has aroused concern amongst many Nigerians exposed to a a video making rounds on Twitter, WhatsApp and other social media platforms alleging that the communities held by Boko Haram in Niger State are now being forced to convert to Islam by the terror group, Boko Haram. The claim was shared multiple times on WhatsApp, apparently arousing peoples outrage over the said situation. The video has also made an appearance on Twitter, after it was tweeted by Femi Fani-Kayode who later acknowledged in a subsequent post that the acclaimed incident did not happen in Niger State, Nigeria. Femi Fani-Kayodes tweet as regards the claim in question Notwithstanding, multiple reactions to the claim showed a wide range of believability, a minimal skepticism from some users, and just a few contrary opinions by other users. The sensitivity of security issues in Nigeria is like a ticking bomb that requires quick and prudent attention. It is as a result of this reality that DUBAWA opted to uncover the verity of this claim. While the governor of Niger State has already debunked the claim, stating that it was fake news, the details of clarification neither stated where the conversion ceremony took place. However, DUBAWA uncovered that the purported video was taken out of its original context to paint a misleading story. It was originally shared on Tik Tok by a user (@brahimakone49) as part of a collection of videos that were posted to depict an apparent Islamic crusade that commenced on 29th of April 2021 in the town of Kolia, Ivory Coast. The user, @brahimakone49 who originally shared the video on Tik tok took time to respond to other users who needed clarification on the actual event the video depicted. He confirmed that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast and stated clearly that it was a crusade held by a certain female Muslim cleric who was performing healing sessions on the crowdin the video. In clip 9 of the video collection, when a commenter (@banfana banfana) asked what was actually happening in the scene, the actual source replied that all the people present came to be treated in Kolia by the woman who works miracles. Also in clip 9, when asked by another user (@Toure Deed) where it took place, the publisher clearly stated that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast. Throughout the comment box, the actual author of the video collection repeatedly mentioned that it took place in Kolia, Ivory coast and explained generally that the event was a healing session held by a certain female Islamic cleric who is seen speaking in subsequent clips of the video . Image 1 DUBAWA uncovered that the acclaimed video making rounds on social media was merely the 10th out of a series of 11 videos shared by the original source. Image 2 The username of the original source is highlighted green above in one of the purported claims making rounds. The same username could be traced in image 1. While the writing partie 10 outlined in blue, shows the sequence number of the video amongst total 11 of the collection originally shared, as it can be seen in image 3 below. Image 3 These are the rest of the collection the purported video was selected from to paint a new and misleading narrative . All highlighted yellow in the center of each clip. Nonetheless, to have a further grasp of the context, content and reality of the actual video shared on Tik tok the link to all the clips are presented below: Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4, Part 5, Part 6 , Part 7 , Part 8 , Part 9, Part 10 , Part 11 Additionally, seven other clips shared by the same author giving the actual event an even more glaring context are shared here: Part 1, Part 2 , Part 3, Part 4 , Part 5, Part 6, part 7 Also notable was the Baoul dialect and a little bit of French spoken throughout the duration of the clips. While French is the official language of Ivory Coast, Baoule is also a major language spoken in the country. The video circulating on social media alleging that Boko Haram is forcing commuters in Niger State of Nigeria to convert to Islam is false. The purported footage was taken out of its original context of 11 videos and used to depict an entirely untrue narrative.",0
"Claim: Three images from Instablog9jas old post depict the perpetrators of a ritual killing. Verdict: Misleading! Our findings traced the images to three separate occurrences across Lagos, Uganda, and Ghana, suggesting that the narrative used to promote the assertion was fabricated for social media sensation. Three collaged images have been trending on social media, particularly on Facebook. Instablog9ja, a popular Nigerian blog, initially posted these images. The images depict a young man, a woman described as his mother, and a police van carrying a wrapped corpse. The duo was alleged to have conspired to rape, poison and eventually kill the mans younger sister for ritual purposes. He was caught during a stop-and-search operation carried out along Itamaga, Ikorodu Road in the state. During interrogation, he reportedly confessed to the Police that his mother, based on the native doctors instruction, asked him to k#ll his younger sister so that he could become rich, Instablog9ja claimed. Instablog9ja made this post on May 8, 2023, and Yabeleft Online republished the same narrative the next day. The popularity of these blogs made the claim go viral in the referred year. However, this claim began to recirculate in Oct 2024, as seen here , here , and here , with several users calling to prosecute the alleged suspects. DUBAWA decided to verify this verification due to the claims potential for misinformation. Image 1 DUBAWAs reverse image search traced this young mans image to an April 26, 2019, event. On that day, Bashiru Ahmed, a 21-year-old, was allegedly involved in a knife stabbing that led to the death of Oshin Aderibigbe, the Spokesperson of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS). Mr Aderibigbe, a recent graduate of the Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology, Lagos, was attacked in the Okoko area of Lagos State. Punch , Premium Times , and Daily Post reported this incident. Image 2 Again, DUBAWA found that the image of this woman did not originate from Nigeria but from a Ugandan murder case reported on Feb. 20, 2013. The woman, Rosemary Kamuli, 30, was arrested for killing her co-wife, Anna Basemera, in Kijenga village, Karago Town Council, Kabarole District, Uganda. According to the Uganda Radio Network (URN) , Ms Kamuli allegedly murdered Basemera after she visited their marital home to perform traditional rituals following the birth of twins with their shared husband. Image 3 Like the previous images, DUBAWA found that the third image is connected to a 2022 serial killing that took place in Wa town, Ghana. The wrapped corpse in the police truck was reportedly exhumed from a shallow grave in Bahamu, a suburb of Wa, on Sept. 19, 2022. According to Otec 102.9 FM , 18 people were arrested in connection with the incident, although eight were later released on bail. Our findings show none of these images described a rape, poisoning or ritual killing of anyone in Lagos, Nigeria. These images going viral are old and from an Instablog9jas 2023 post, which we found was fabricated to mislead the public.",0
"Claim : A Facebook user claims the Ghanian government has introduced uniforms for its school teachers. The claim that the government of Ghana has introduced uniforms for its school teachers is false. The Public Relations Officer for the Ghana Ministry of Education and the Spokesperson, Ghana Ministry of Education, both confirmed that the information is false. For reasons such as equality, safety and sense of belonging, the concept of school uniform among primary and secondary schools in Africa has come to stay. Uniforms are the clothing students are required to wear at school. Schools often have specific styles and colours, to identify students as attending a particular institution. Unlike students, school teachers in Africa are, however, rarely seen wearing school uniforms. Rather, they adopt corporate dresses as their dress code. This claim surprisingly indicates that the Ghana government has implemented the wearing of school uniforms by teachers. The post was shared by this Facebook user. The post, accompanied by the post are pictures of some women and a man kitted in dull peach-coloured shirts and deep brown skirts and trousers, went viral and even resurfaced on Twitter . The chest pocket of the shirts reads Ghana Education Service. The post, which has been widely shared and retweeted, has also caused controversial debates among users who saw the uniform as unacceptable and those who regarded it as a welcomed development. Reacting to the claim, Alice Chobola, a Facebook user, condemned the governments act, saying it was not right for teachers to wear uniforms. She wrote: Wrong of Ghana to do that. Nurses wear uniforms, patients own clothes, so pupils wear uniforms, teachers own clothes, Epela. However, unlike Alice, Mavis Mulundano said introducing school uniforms to teachers will curb secret activities performed by them during school hours. She wrote, It can be a very good idea in Zambia so as to reduce the number of teachers who go drinking during working hours for fear of being spotted in uniform. It is due to this virality that DUBAWA decided to conduct a fact check. DUBAWA first conducted a Google keyword search and discovered that the claim has also been published by this blog , this blog , and this blog . However, it was not reported by any credible news platform. DUBAWA then contacted Cassandra Twum, the Public Relations Officer for Ghana Education Service. Bluntly but clearly, she discredited the claim, saying: Oh but this is an old fake story. Disregard! not true. Furthermore, DUBAWA also spoke with Kwasi Kwarteng, the Spokesperson of Ghana Ministry of Education who also debunked the news, saying in a WhatsApp chat: The Ghana Education Service has not approved of any uniform/attire for its teachers. The Public Relations Officer for Ghana Ministry of Education and the Spokesperson, Ghana Ministry of Education, have debunked the news. The circulating claim that the Ghana government asked its teachers to wear uniforms to work is, therefore, false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user, Aloysious Howe, claims that The Economic Community of West African States has responded to a letter written by former president George Weah over the alleged witch-hunt of his supporters. Verdict: Misleading. According to Madam Irene Wallace, the special assistant in the office of the ECOWAS Representative in Liberia, the working visit is a routine post-electoral visit already in the making. After a chaotic clash between supporters of George Weah and officials of state security, which led to injuries and destruction of properties, there were a lot of statements across the political divide condemning the clashes. Former President George Weah issued one such statement. In an attempt to draw the attention of international and subregional organisations to what he believed to be attacks and persecution of his supporters, Ex-President Weah issued an official statement to the Economic Community of West African States. The letter in part reads: I write to draw your attention and through you, the Authority of Heads of State, to an unprovoked attack on the headquarters of our political institution, the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), on Thursday, August 22, 2024, by Liberian security forces under the dubious guise of effecting a drug raid. This premeditated and callous act of violence targeted at the countrys main opposition political party is the latest in a series of actions by the Boakai Administration to trample upon political freedoms, disregard the laws of the land, undermine democracy and stoke tension in the country. However, on Monday, August 26, 2024, social media (Facebook) was flooded with communication from the Economic Community of West African States office (ECOWAS) in Liberia, believed to be an official response from the regional body to former President George Weah of Liberia. A Facebook user, Aloysious How, a staunch member of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), was part of those who took their official Facebook pages claiming that the communication from ECOWAS was a direct and official response to the former Liberian leaders complaint. According to Mr Howe , The Economic Community of West African State(ECOWAS) has responded to a letter written by President George Weah to the West African body. Due to the severity and importance of President George Weahs concerns, the president of ECOWAS, H.E. Omar Alieu Touray, in his official response to President George Weah, has unveiled that he will lead a delegation of officials of ECOWAS to Liberia today and will meet with President George Weah at 7:00 pm Liberia time, Mr Howe stated. The appearance of this alleged viral response from ECOWAS coincided with ECOWAS officials visit to Liberia. But is it true that ECOWAS has responded to ex-president George Weah? With claims and counter-claims over the actual intent of the ECOWAS communication, DUBAWA thought it necessary to investigate if the viral letter was indeed from ECOWAS and whether their arrival into Liberia had anything to do with the letter George Weah wrote. Our researcher first contacted the claimant via WhatsApp for evidence aside from what he posted that backed his claim, and he responded by saying that he maintains his post, as seen in the screenshot below. The researcher approached the office of the ECOWAS Representative in Liberia, Madam Josephine Nkrumah, through her special assistant, Madam Irene Wallace. Madam Wallace told our researcher that the visit by ECOWASs president, Mr Omar Alieu Touray, was a routine visit in line with ECOWAS regional peacebuilding agenda to foster peace and unity within the region. She furthered, The working visit is a routine post-electoral visit, which was already in the making. While in Liberia, he will also meet with major stakeholders to discuss issues ranging from peace and security to reconciliation, among others. Upon the arrival of the ECOWAS president, Madam Wallace also shared with our researcher a communication outlining the ECOWAS presidents activities while in Liberia. According to the communication, during President Omar Alieu Tourays visit, he and his delegation met His Excellency Joseph Nyumah Boakai, President of the Republic of Liberia, and other stakeholders. Following Liberias credible elections in 2023, ECOWAS is here to support Liberias post-election national reconciliation efforts in solidarity with the people of Liberia, the communication stated. Screenshot of the communication as seen below Based on the clarity provided by the ECOWAS Representative in Liberia concerning the visit of the ECOWAS president to Liberia, the claim by Mr Howe is misleading.",1
"A post on Facebook claims that the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (Tetfund) is giving out grants to Nigerians. The post, dated 12 June 2023, reads : Apply today and become a beneficiary of TetFund Grant. This is available only for Nigerians. The post includes a link to a website which says that Tetfund is giving out N30,000 to each beneficiary. The Nigerian government established Tetfund in 2011 to distribute, manage, and oversee education tax to state-owned tertiary institutions. But is Tetfund giving out grants directly to Nigerians? We checked. Tetfund is an intervention organisation that was established to offer supplemental assistance to all public higher education institutions. There are several media reports about the organisation funding research projects and contributing towards the maintenance of infrastructure and equipment in the education sector. Africa Check found no report of the government institution giving out grants of N30,000 directly to individuals. The link in the Facebook post takes you to a page that requires you to answer some general questions. These include whether youre a Nigerian citizen or not, and what youll use the money for. Suspiciously , regardless of your answers, you will be taken to the next step, and ultimately told that you qualify for the grant. The website also has what appears to be a screenshot of the comments section of a Facebook post. This shows comments from users who say theyve received the funds and urge others to apply. If you complete all the steps, you are taken to a blog titled Scholarships Infopedia . This points to the Facebook post being a scam. It uses a tactic known as engagement bait . By liking, commenting or sharing the post, users increase its reach, but there are no grants awarded. By increasing the reach of the Facebook post, scammers are able to draw visitors to the website. Africa Check debunked a similar claim in 2021. Those posts also claimed that Tetfund was giving out N30,000 to Nigerian students. This turned out to be false and a scam.

"The presidential candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Abiola Kolawole and his running mate, Zego Haruna, are on the town hall series by Daria Media Limited. The series, tagged The Candidates, provides a platform for the candidates to address national issues ahead of the February 25 , 2023, general election. The programme, anchored by Nigerian journalist, Kadaria Ahmed, is supported by the MacArthur Foundation, Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), and YouTube. DUBAWA, a member of the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition (NCF), will be involved in live fact-checking of claims made by the candidates. Claims made by the candidates and fact-check reports are presented below: Claim: Presidential candidate, Kola Abiola, claims the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) is the oldest party in Nigeria. The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) was formed by Aminu Kano in 1978 after his withdrawal from the National Party of Nigeria. Created alongside four others, PRP is the oldest political party compared to the 17 other parties in Nigeria registered by INEC for the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Verdict: CORRECT Source: PRP website , The Guardian report Date: 22/11/2022 Claim: Kola Abiola, on Daria Media town hall, said Nigeria has an informal sector that is 60% of our economy. The most recent GDP report by the National Bureau of Statistics, which differentiated the formal and informal sectors, covered 2015. It puts the share of the informal sector at 41.43% . In 2017, the IMF estimated that the informal sector contributed 65% of Nigerias GDP. Verdict: False Source: National Bureau of Statistics, IMF Date: 22/11/2022",1
"Claim: The APC Women Leader, Dr Betta Edu, in a recent interview, claims that the Labour Party has no governorship candidate in Cross River State. She added that her party had won all House Representatives seats in the state except in the Northern Senatorial District. Verdict: Misleading. The Labour Partys governorship candidate in the election is Mr Ogar Osim. Also, the APC failed to win the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani seat. Bassey Akiba of the Labour Party won it. In a recent interview on Arise TV, a former commissioner of health in Cross River state and the current National Women Leader of the ruling All Progressive Congress, APC made various claims regarding the recent elections. Speaking about the national parliamentary elections, Ms Edu said: I want to put this to the fore that APC won the House of Representative seats except that of the Northern part of the state. So, APC won in the central, APC won in the south, and we only lost in the Northern part of the state. On the state governorship elections, she said: The Labour Party won [the presidential election in the state], APC came close second, and then PDP came far third. Going into the next election, Labour Party doesnt have a candidate. Ms Betta added, for PDP, we are not worried about them. They are not a threat to us. We are discussing with them and working hand in hand with them because they do not even have a governorship candidate. They will work with us in APC. In verifying the claim that the APC swept all the House of Representatives seats in the central and southern part of the state, DUBAWA looked through the list of members-elect of the House of Representatives shared by the Independent National Electoral Commission. On the list published by INEC, of the eight seats, PDP won the two available slots in the Northern Senatorial District. APC won all three available seats in the Central Senatorial District, while the APC took two seats and LP one seat in the Southern Senatorial District. Under the column for Cross River State and number 81 on the overall list, Akiba Bassey Ekpenyong of the Labour Party is listed as the winner of the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani Federal Representative Seat. While INEC has yet to upload a comprehensive list of governorship candidates, information from credible media houses such as Vanguard and Daily Post show that Mr Ogar Osim is the Labour Partys candidate for the governorship seat in the State alongside Ekpezu Obu as his running mate. Following claims made by the APC in Cross River that the party was working hand-in-glove with the Labour Party, the State Publicity Secretary of the Labour Party, Dr Lekan Ofem, denied the existence of such arrangement, insisting that the party has a Governorship Candidate in the person of Patriarch Ogar Osim who is in the race to victory. Claims by Ms Edu that the APC had won all the available House of Representatives seats in the Central and Southern part of Cross River State in last months elections are misleading, as the party lost the Calabar Municipality/Odukpani seat to Bassey Akiba of LP. Also, the claim that the Labour Party has no governorship candidate in this Saturdays polls is false, as Mr Osim is flying the LPs flag in the elections. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with CrossRiverWatch, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: Since 2017 to date, no politician, Human rights activist, or journalist has been jailed in The Gambia, said Adama Barrow, President of the Republic of The Gambia. Verdict: False! Checks by DUBAWA indicate that several journalists, human rights activists, and politicians have been arrested, charged and detained in the country since 2017. Gambian President, Adama Barrow claimed at the 79th UN General Assembly that there had been no jailing of political prisoners, including human rights defenders and journalists, in the country since 2017. I am happy to report that, since 2017, The Gambia has neither recorded a single political prisoner nor has any journalist or human rights activist been jailed, he stated during his UNGA speech delivered on Thursday, Sept. 26 2024 at the UN headquarters in New York, United States. The video of this speech can be found on YouTube here . President Barrows claim can be heard around 10:43 to 10:58 of the video. This part of the speech by the president has triggered some amount of disquiet in the Gambia, with some criticising the comment as untrue. The comment has gone viral because the president took over from a dictatorial leader Yahya Jammeh, whose tenure was greeted with lots of human rights abuses, unlawful detentions, unexplained disappearances etc as captured by the Gambia Truth Commission. So is it true that the Gambia has not witnessed any form of arrests, and human rights abuses since 2017? To fact-check this claim, DUBAWA used different sources to determine who or what constitutes a political prisoner or detainee. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) defines Political Prisoners as follows: Cambridge Dictionarys definition of a political prisoner/political detainee is someone who is put in prison forexpressingdisapprovalof their government, or forbelongingto anorganization,race, orsocialgroupnotapprovedof by thatgovernment or a person who has been officially ordered to stay in a prison or similar place, especially for political reasons. Based on the above definitions of a political prisoner/detainee, DUBAWA made findings on some of the arrest and detention cases involving political opponents, human rights activists, and journalists that occurred in the Gambia from 2017 to date. In February 2018, Dr. Ismaila Ceesay, a political science lecturer at the University of The Gambia and now Minister of Information, was detained for a day at Police Headquarters in Banjul and then charged with incitement to violence for his comments about ECOMIG forces in the Gambia, saying President Barrow needs to earn the confidence of the armed forces. In 2020, executive members of the pressure group 3 Years Jotna were arrested, detained, and prosecuted for various offences including unlawful assembly, riotous demolishing of buildings, and rioting after the proclamation in connection to the Jan. 26 2020 protest. The group had called for the president to step down and honour the coalition agreement after serving three years. In September 2023, the then UPDs Campaign Manager, Momodou Sabally , (now presidential adviser), and Nominated Councilor for Transportation at Brikama Area Council, Sheriffo Baiyo Sonko, were detained and charged at the police headquarters in Banjul. Saballys detention was in connection with a TikTok video in which he said his party would take over the country in the exercise of his political right. On June 30, 2020, human rights activist Madi Jobarteh was arrested, detained, and charged with false information and broadcasting. Again in November 2023, Jobarteh was arrested and charged with seditious intention. His arrests in 2020 and 2023 followed comments he made critical of the police and the president respectively. However, he has not been prosecuted on any of the charges against him since. DUBAWA looked further into some of the arrests and detentions of journalists from 2017 to date. On Jan. 26, 2020, journalist Pa Modou Bojang, the Manager of Home Digital FM, Gibbi Jallow and Ebrima Jallow, Managers of King FM were arrested and charged with inciting violence while their radio stations were closed after covering protesters calling on President Barrow to step down and honour the 2016 coalition agreement to serve only three years. On Jan. 28, 2020 Pa Modou Bojang, Home Digital FM Gibbi Jallow, Ebrima Jallow, and Maidou Jallow of King FM were released. They spent two nights incommunicado without access to family or legal representation at various police stations. On July 5, 2022, police officers blocked Yusuf Taylor (Flex Dan), editor of the privately owned Gainako online newspaper, from reporting on a land dispute in Bijilo, in the Gambias West Coast Region, and then arrested him and charged him with obstructing police. On Sept. 20, 2023, Bakary Mankajang, the CEO of the online platform Mangkajang Daily was detained by the Police Anti-Crime Unit for three days in connection with his reporting on a shooting incident that led to the killing of two police officers on Sept. 12. He was released on bail and charged with Interference with witness on Sept. 23, 2023. On Sept. 26, 2024, Momodou Justice Darboe, a reporter at The Voice Newspaper, was charged with publication of false news and broadcasting and detained at the Police Headquarters in Banjul for almost 48 hours. His detention came just a day after the legal team of President Adama Barrow wrote to the Newspaper, demanding a retraction and public apology or face defamation lawsuits over an article that read; BarrowChooses Muhammed JahAsSuccessor As Pres.Workson Exit Plan-Sources Darboe was released on Sept. 28 2024 with a bail bond of D25,000. Subsequently, The Newspaper Editor-In-Chief Musa Sheriff w as also arrested on Monday, Sept. 30, 2024, when he reported to the police. He was charged with false publication and broadcasting and detained. The Gambia Press Union has condemned the arrest of the journalists and called on the police to immediately release them and drop the charges. In the Gambia 2024 State of Press Freedom and Freedom of Expression report, the Gambia Press Union (GPU) documented that: Journalists and media workers and human rights defenders have also faced arbitrary arrests by the police, detained incommunicado without access to family or lawyers with whereabouts unknown and in one instance physically assaulted while in custody, and released with or without charges. Incidences of physical assault on journalists and media professionals perpetrated either by the police or political party militants which occurred since 2017 have never been investigated, and no one is held accountable. The Union has recorded a total of six cases involving the arrest and detention of journalists, along with the arbitrary closure of two radio stations from 2017 to date. Contrary to the presidents claim, the Gambia Press Union has recorded six cases of arrest and detention from 2017 till date.",1

"Menstruation is a natural and healthy process for most women, with approximately half of the global female populationabout 26% of the worlds total populationbeing of reproductive age. Typically, women menstruate for two to seven days each month. According to the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), an average woman will spend about seven years menstruating. The Cleveland Clinic defines menstruation as the monthly shedding of the uterus lining. Known also as a period, menses, or menstrual cycle, it involves the discharge of menstrual blood, a combination of blood and tissue from the uterine lining, which flows from the uterus through the cervix and out of the body through the vagina . But is it possible for women to menstruate through their palms or toes? DUBAWAs keyword query found no evidence to support this claim. To clarify further, we sought the expertise of medical professionals. A gynaecologist, Emmanuel Olowookeere, said the claim is unscientific and baseless, and there is no evidence to support the idea that it occurs through the palms or soles of the feet. There is no way a woman can menstruate from the palms or toes. If a woman has redness or sweating on any part of her body, it does not mean she is menstruating from there, he clarified. The doctor addressed misconceptions about conditions that could cause unusual symptoms, such as endometriosis. Endometriosis occurs when the normal lining of the uterus is found elsewhere in the body, such as the intestines, ovaries, umbilical area, or even the lungs. However, he explained that there is no recorded case of uterine lining on the palms or soles of the feet, he explained. There is no way a woman can menstruate from the palms and the toes. A woman may have redness on any part of her body at any time, but that does not mean she is menstruating from it. Or if the palm is very sweaty or something that is not menstruation, it could be endometriosis where there could be the presence of normal lining of the uterus elsewhere in the body. Still, not in the palm or the sole, he added. Dr Emmanuel emphasised that while endometriosis can lead to rare occurrences, such as lesions in the brain, menstruation through the palms or toes remains biologically impossible. He urged the public to rely on verified medical information rather than unfounded claims. Another medical practitioner, Adekemi Odeyemi, said it is not typical for women to experience bleeding from other parts of their body during their menstrual period; however, a condition called Endometriosis may cause bleeding outside the uterus. Odeyemi stated that it cannot be completely ruled out in cases of Endometriosis. She said, So, the condition where people can bleed from other parts of their body during their menstrual period is called Endometriosis. This condition is characterised by the presence of the womb tissue in other parts of the body. So, during menses, these other parts can bleed as well. It is, however, not common to bleed from the palms, but the possibility cannot be ruled out. Endometriosis is a chronic medical condition that affects approximately 10% (190 million) of women and girls of reproductive age globally. According to the World Health Organization , it is characterised by severe pain during menstruation, sexual intercourse, bowel movements, or urination, along with chronic pelvic pain, bloating, nausea, fatigue, and, in some cases, depression and infertility. The condition can begin with a persons first menstrual period and persist until menopause. Yale Medicine explains that the endometrium thickens and sheds during a typical menstrual cycle. However, in women with endometriosis, tissue outside the uterus also sheds, leading to pain, inflammation, and the formation of scar tissue. This shedding in the abdomen during menstruation is the primary cause of painful periods in individuals with endometriosis. A 2019 study by Fawole et al. reported a prevalence rate of 48.1% for asymptomatic endometriosis among Nigerian women. Unfortunately, many women experience delays in diagnosis, which can result in prolonged suffering and diminished quality of life. The study adds that the average delay for diagnosis among women aged 1845 is approximately 6.7 years. The common symptoms of endometriosis, as outlined by Cleveland Clinic , include painful menstrual cramps, abdominal or back pain during or between periods, heavy menstrual bleeding or light bleeding between periods, pain during sex (dyspareunia), infertility, and gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea, constipation, or bloating. The exact cause of endometriosis remains unknown, and while there is no cure, treatment options are available to help manage symptoms. These may include medications or, in some cases, surgery. DUBAWAs findings highlight common areas in the body where endometriosis can occur, including the space behind the uterus, myometrium (a layer of the uterine wall), ovaries, peritoneum, and fallopian tubes. Despite the challenges of diagnosis and treatment, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, early diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial for improving the quality of life for those affected by the condition. DUBAWAs findings reveal that while endometriosis is a real condition that can cause pain and symptoms in various parts of the body during menstruation, it does not lead to menstruation through unconventional body parts like the palms and toes. Menstruation occurs only through the vagina. The claim is false.",1
"Ibadan is the ancient town that became Oyo states capital. Its residents were on the verge of retiring from the days bustling activities when a tragedy struck. It was evening, past 6 pm on Jan. 16, 2024, when Adebimpe Folasade just returned to her residence in Bodija after closing at work in Elebu. The tiring schedule wasnt strange as she opened the door to her one-room self-contain where she lived alone. She dropped her heavy bag on the bed in her usual daily rhythm. Her body followed suit for 15 minutes before getting up to prepare noodles for dinner. At intervals, she switched between the kitchen and her bedroom until her meal was ready to satiate her hunger. Suddenly, a loud boom sent her out of her reverie as she enjoyed her meal. I was startled, and my noodles poured to the floor. But I wasnt even thinking of it. Noodles cant even come to my mind when a sound like a bomb that Ive never heard before explodes. I immediately scurried from the window because it rattled, she told DUBAWA in pidgin. When she was certain of her safety, she stepped out to check but got no tangible information. Social media should provide more accurate information, or so she thought. An explosion rocked the Bodija community in Ibadan North local government, Oyo state. According to a statement released by the state Police Police Public Relations Officer, Adewale Oyefeso, the incident occurred at about 7:44 pm. Residents in places far from Bodija, like Eleyele (12.67km), Ologuneru (9km), Mokola (7km), and Akobo (9km), among other places, shared on social media how they felt the impact in varying degrees. The state governor, Seyi Makinde, revealed that some occupants housed explosives for illegal mining, which caused the explosion that claimed two lives and injured 77 others as of Wednesday, Jan. 17, 2024. According to him, rescue operations were ongoing, and the state government would cover all medical bills. While the dust was yet to settle, Ms Folasade found many accounts sharing claims about the cause and saw frightening images that she couldnt believe. Claim 1: It was a gas explosion On Facebook, one Docktor Ment claimed that it was a gas explosion. He feared that the explosion, which collapsed the popular Ace Mall in Bodija, would cause critical damage to the environment. He said, Im still wondering how the main site of the gas explosion will be right now because for the sound to be heard and felt by people far away, it must be very serious. Verdict: FALSE. The gas station hes referring to is owned by Gasland Nigeria Limited at Bodija. Apart from reports attributed to reliable sources and eyewitnesses that DUBAWA spoke with, the company also released a statement allaying customers fears and expressing its commitment to cooperating with emergency responders. Part of the statement reads, While our facility remains secure and operational, we understand the distress and concern this incident has caused in the community, and we want to unequivocally state that the explosion did not originate from any Gasland Nigeria Ltd. facility Claim 2: Explosion happened at Aderinola street Another Facebook user, Oladele Idowu Joseph, claimed that the explosion happened at Aderinola Street. Its nothing close to a gas explosion. Not Gasland, not in Samonda. Its a massive blast in Aderinola street in Bodija, cause yet unknown, he wrote on his timeline. Verdict: FALSE. We confirmed from the information provided by the state Police PRO and the governors account that the explosion occurred at the close of Dejo Oyeleso. Though they were both at Bodija, the distance between both locations was approximately 2.6km or 1.6 miles. Claim 3: The explosion was from a transformer A Facebook user, Oyindamola Okuneye, claimed that the explosion resulted from a transformer that blew up. Verdict: FALSE. According to the governor , the incident occurred at a residential building that stored IED explosives for illegal mining purposes. Claim 4: 500 dead from the explosion Barely hours after the incident, Oga Yenne (Uyo Influencer) [@ogayenne] asked on X if a rumour about 500 people died from the explosion was true. He said, I hope the people of Ibadan are safe. Is it true that over 500 people [have already been] killed in the blast? Verdict: FALSE. As of the time the report was filed, official reports revealed that only two had died, while 77 were injured. Claim 5: Image of a blast from the Ibadan explosion Another X user,The Cruise TV [@the_cruisetv], apart from claiming that the blast was from a gas station, also shared the image of a huge explosion and urged followers to retweet for others to see. Verdict: MISLEADING. DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search on the picture and discovered that it had been in existence as far back as Sept. 6, 2014 . Even the image was blurred in the source found, which indicates that it existed before it was used on the website. While false and misleading claims hover around the Bodija bombing incident, official sources have confirmed that IED explosives devices stored at a residential building for illegal mining caused the bombing at Dejo Oyeleso Street. So far, only two have been reported dead and 77 injured.",1
"Claim: Viral photos depict variations of Malta Guinness non-alcoholic drink pack, alleging one is fake, and a police invasion of an illegal Guinness factory at the Trade Fair in Lagos State. Verdict: Misleading! The pictures being recirculated are from 2018. Also, the company in question addressed the issue of the difference in the can designs in a 2017 press release and a recent statement. In the past few days, the Nigerian social media space has been awash with reports of fake fast-moving consumer goods flooding markets across the country. DUBAWA came across these posts on X (Twitter) and Facebook , as seen here , here and here . Some social media users have expressed their confusion over which cans are genuine and which are fake so as not to fall victim to counterfeit products. While many Nigerians criticised the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) over its failure to stop the influx of these fake products, others have made posts explaining the differences between the original and perceived counterfeit products. An allegation that stood out was the one regarding the production of fake Malta Guinness non-alcoholic drinks in the market. A similar post reads , See what you have been drinking. They buy a truck of Malta Guinness from Guinness. In a pack of 24, they remove 12 and replace it with 12 fake cans of the ones they produced. The originals are the ones on the outer side of the pack, while the fake ones are in between. Heard its peculiar around trade fair in Lagos. Ghana Web also reported similar news recently, adding that a police invasion of a fake factory producing Malta Guinness in the Trade Fair area of Lagos state occurred. The report shared that fake drink producers buy a truck of Malta Guinness non-alcoholic drink and replace a portion of the glasses with the one produced illegally, after which they start reselling to unsuspecting consumers. They also shared images of police officers invading a fake Malta Guinness factory and a photo showing two drink cans with different designs. Considering Nigerians growing concerns and the fact that its the yuletide where families celebrate with drinks and food, DUBAWA decided to verify the allegation about the fake Malta Guinness cans. A Reverse Image Search Result showed that the images attached to the claims of police invasion of a fake malt factory in the Egbe-Afa, Igbobo area of Ikorodu, Lagos state, happened as far back as 2018. Therefore, it is not recent. The Lagos police command at the time explained that the factory produced fake stout and ethanol, which were later transported elsewhere to be bottled and sold. According to reports, the illegal brewery had over 1,000 drums of brewed malt and up to 100 tanks where the drinks were pumped before supplying tankers. On the claims of two different cans in the market, DUBAWA performed a keyword search on Malta Guinness social media pages to see if the issue had once been addressed. The investigation led to a 2017 press release from the company that explained that the two cans are genuine and are products of Diageo Limited, the parent company of Guinness Nigeria Limited. According to the release, one of the cans was produced in Nigeria, and a Diageo-licensed brewer in Togo brewed the other. DUBAWA further contacted the company (Malta Guinness) to comment on the recent allegation of a counterfeit variation of their product. We asked if there is an ongoing investigation, but they have yet to respond as of the time of this report. However, DUBAWA consequently observed that Malta Guinness issued a press statement on Dec 19, 2023. In the report, the firm urged the public to ignore the posts regarding fake Malta Guinness drinks in circulation. The company said the two packages were genuine but no longer used. Below is a screenshot of the statement. The parent company, Guinness Nigeria Plc, also issued a similar press statement on Dec 19, explaining that the two can designs in the image were genuine but no longer in use as the company had rebranded the can designs. It also encouraged users to be wary of false information about fake Malta Guinness drinks in circulation, describing them as the handiwork of fake news purveyors. For clarity, both Malta Guinness packaging shown in the viral posts are old packaging that is no longer in circulation, the press release read in part. The images shared widely on social media do not depict a recent invasion of an illegal brewery in Lagos. Also, the two can designs of Malta Guinness non-alcoholic drink shared on social media are genuine, according to a press statement from the company. However, it is unclear if any illegal brewery recently existed at the Trade Fair in Lagos state.",0
"Claim: An X user posted a video claiming that an armed robbery attack took place on July 27, 2024, in Surulere, Lagos State. He further insinuated that the recency of the event could make propagandists link the video to the planned nationwide protest. Verdict: The claim is misleading. The video is from the 2020 EndSARS protests and is unrelated to recent events or the planned nationwide protest. As Nigeria braces for a planned #EndBadGovernance nationwide protest to address rising living costs and economic hardship, major cities like Lagos, Abuja, and Kano have been on high alert. Various groups and stakeholders have been voicing differing opinions on the protest. Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has engaged with civil society and self-determination groups, emphasising the need for peace and warning against the destruction witnessed during the Oct 2020 EndSARS protest . He suggested that some individuals might have ulterior motives for disrupting law and order. For her part, Folashade Tinubu, daughter of President Bola Tinubu, addressed a group of marketers, stating that there would be no protest in Lagos State . She urged parents to warn their children against joining the planned hunger protest on August 1, pointing out that victims of the EndSARS protest are still recovering from their losses nearly four years later. On July 28, 2024, a verified X user, Fugar 20.10.20 (@Atentemente), posted a video claiming that an armed robbery occurred in Surulere, Lagos State, on July 27, 2024. The user suggested that certain individuals might use this incident as propaganda to link it to the upcoming protest. The post read: This is Bode Thomas Surulere, where armed robbery took place yesterday. It may be due to the hardship, but I dont want the children of the roasted to use it as propaganda that its from any protest As of July 29, 2024, the post had garnered over 4,700 views, 2,000 reposts, and 3,300 likes. DUBAWA observed mixed reactions in the comments, with some people believing the claim and others doubting its authenticity The video was also shared with captions similar to those seen here . DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on keyframes from the video, revealing that the footage has been online since October 2020. The footage is linked to massive lootings by hoodlums during the EndSARS protests. The search led to earlier posts, as seen here , here , and here . In October 2020, Nigeria, especially Lagos, experienced significant violence related to the #EndSARS protest, which began as a peaceful movement against police brutality by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The situation escalated on October 20, 2020, when shootings occurred at the Lekki toll gate , leading to widespread violence, looting, and arson. Reports ( here and here ) indicate that the looting in the video occurred at the Eric Moore end of Bode Thomas Street Surulere, Lagos. The Lagos State government responded through the Deputy Governor , Dr Obafemi Hamzat, who tweeted on his verified X handle, asking affected businesses to fill out a form for a recovery fund. A keyword search by DUBAWA did not find any recent reports from credible media outlets about a recent robbery in Surulere. No official statements were found from the Police Public Relations Officer of Lagos State, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, after checking his verified X handle (@BenHundeyin). However, on July 29, 2024, he reposted a response to the claim from X user Temi (@yusuf_temi), clarifying that the video was from the EndSARS protest. The response read, This video was taken during the EndSARS protest. Dont fall for this cheap lie. The claim that an armed robbery occurred in Surulere, Lagos State, on July 27, 2024, is misleading. The video showing looting and vandalism is from the 2020 EndSARS protests and is unrelated to recent events. There is no evidence to support the connection between the video and the upcoming #EndBadGovernance protest. The researcher produced this fact-check as part of the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, which is in partnership with Bridge Radio 98.7FM, Asaba, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A Twitter user claimed a collection of pictures he shared is that of northerners Peter Obi has pursued from Anambra State. He further claimed Mr Obi, while serving as governor, demolished a mosque. The claim is false. All the alleged pictures were taken from totally different contexts that are unrelated to the claim. A user on Twitter, Qudus Akanbi Eleyi (@Qdpaper2) claims that Peter Obi demolished a mosque in Anambra and pursued Hausa, Fulani and other northerners from the state while he was still governor. A collection of pictures that depict what appears to be a demolished mosque and of several persons in a desolate state was used to accompany the post with the caption: Northerners will never forget Peter Obi for demolishing their mosque in Anambra. When he was a governor, Hausa, Fulani and Northerners can forgive Peter Obi for pursuing them out of Anambra, but Im not sure if they can forgive him for demolishing their mosque. They will never 4give. Peter Obi is the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LB) for the 2023 Nigerian presidential election. Since his emergence as the partys candidate, the former two-term governor of Anambra has garnered so much attention on social media, especially on Twitter, arousing both support and criticism from diverse users. Anambra is a state in the southeastern part of Nigeria, a region that is largely populated by the Igbo-speaking tribe who are mainly Christians. The Fulani and Hausa tribes are mostly Muslims, and they are largely the dominant population in the northern parts of Nigeria. Like most social media claims, painted along religious and tribal lines, the tweet attracted massive traction and almost two thousand interactions within a week of its appearance. One user, Baba (@antibila) has since believed the claims, adding that Peter Obi deported northerners from the southeast and destroyed their place of worship. Even in some Northern states, Okada has been banned for security reasons. As for Peter Obi, I learnt (he) went further than deporting Northerners going about their genuine businesses out of Iboland (Southeastern Nigeria), but also destroyed their place of worship against laws of the Land, the user wrote. Such claims are capable of inciting violence and can even motivate both tribal and religious tensions. One of the images depicting the alleged destroyed mosque in Anambra A Google reverse image search of the first image, a collage of Peter Obi and the alleged demolished mosque, traced the original image of the mosque to a news report: Cash shortage hampers rebuilding of mosques destroyed by Israel. The report revealed the mosque to be the Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz mosque in Beit Hanoun, northern Gaza Strip, that was destroyed during the Israel-Palestine tension that erupted on 4 January 2009. Multiple reports by different media outlets captured the incident and detailed how the bombings flattened the Omar Ibn Abdul Aziz mosque in Beit Hanoun and damaged many surrounding homes. Apparently, the image has also been fal s ely used to depict an alleged banning of Islam and the destruction of mosques in Angola. A Google reverse search of the second image traced it to a report on sanction.org, a social action website. The social action team members captured the original image when they visited the Obidianso Waterside community in Port Harcourt after the Rivers State government demolished it in 2018. The image was not from Anambra State as alleged and has nothing to do with the northerners or the Hausa-Fulani Muslims residing in Anambra State. The third image is traced to a news report by Vanguard when officers of Abuja Police Command arrested 98 scavengers, popularly known as Baban Bola over stealing in Abuja. The image is neither taken in Anambra nor does it have anything to do with Hausa-Fulani Muslims living in Anambra State. This is equally false. The fourth image, a collage of pictures, was traced to the website of the Muslim News Nigeria. The pictures were used to depict an alleged demolition of a mosque in Port Harcourt by Governor Nysom Wike in 2019. Although Governor Wike has distanced himself from claims that he ordered the demolition of a mosque in Port Harcourt, he has, however, explained that some persons started erecting illegal foundations on the disputed land, even though they had no approval to embark on any construction work. An extensive investigation by the PREMIUM TIMES also revealed that the Rivers State Government did not demolish any completed building being used as a mosque. However, an uncompleted structure, (the same one depicted in the alleged picture) which was still at the foundation stage, was demolished by the government. Unlike Governor Wikes popular controversy over the demolition of a mosque in Rivers State, there is no single report by any reliable media outlet that suggests Peter Obis demolition of a mosque in Anambra State while he was still the governor. While the claim may be debatable, all the images used are pulled from different contexts to support the bogus narrative. This claim is false.",0
"Claim: Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah and Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe claimed: the Invincible Sports Park was constructed by President Weah and his friends. Verdict: Misleading! Checks by DUBAWA show that a portion of the funds used to construct the Invincible Sports Park was budgeted for in the 2022 national budget, while other state institutions contributed financially to the project. Liberia is expected to go to polls on October 10 this year to elect new leaders, including the president, vice president, 73 representatives and 15 senators whose tenures are about to end. The elections will most likely be won or lost based on the oppositions promises and credibility or the track record, achievements or failures of the incumbent. As the campaign heats up, two senior officials of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) led administration headed by soccer icon George Weah took to the national radio to outline the gains made by the CDC government in the last six years. Finance and development planning Minister Samuel Tweah and the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe appeared on the state-owned media outlet, the Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC , to talk about progress made by the CDC government. The show carried on the LBS online radio and Television, LNTV , was also covered by several media institutions, including Front Page Africa and D-TV online . During the show, the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner, Eugene Lenn Nagbe, claimed that President George Weah built the Invincible Sports Park with support from his friends. Commissioner Nagbe was responding to a question asked by one of the journalists on the show about whether some of the projects undertaken by the Liberian leader were executed with his personal or government funds. Nagbe said, The Pro-Poor housing and the market structure the president is building are direct results of what the people asked for when the president made his most recent counties tours. There are some projects that the president is undertaking by himself, like the Invincible Sports Park. He funded it with some support from his friends. He made this claim over the four hours show from 2:25:57 to 2:26:05 hours. Commissioner Nagbes claim was also buttressed by his colleague, Minister Samuel Tweah, during the show. Minister Tweah said, To be clear and honest with you, the Invincible Sports Park was funded by the president because people have tried to bring this president down on the basis of lies, and we are here to fight falsehood. I am happy that the Liberian people no longer believe the lie, so they are flat-footed. They are still bent on spreading lies on their Facebook pages saying that the Invincible Park was built from the government budget, no it was [not], and we are very clear on that one. Minister Tweahs comments came around the 2:35:35 2:36:14 hours of the over four-hour show on Monday, June 19, 2023. The interview has garnered over 7,000 views with over 615 comments. DUBAWA decided to verify the claim due to controversy and the interest the claim generated. To start with, DUBAWA sighted a February 9, 2021 , video in which President George Weah broke grounds for the construction of the Invincible Sports Park, located in Sinkor, Fish Market, directly opposite the home of ex-Liberian President Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. At the program, President Weah said that he felt obligated to the people of the area where the park is constructed because, according to him, it was where he used to play when he started his footballing career. The Liberian leader said, I, therefore, want you to know that I am developing this public park as my personal contribution to the people of this area. President Weah made the remarks at 35:24-36:00 minutes/seconds of his speech during the groundbreaking ceremony. But was the Invincible Park built solely with funds from the president? The Minister of State without Portfolio, Trokon Kpui, appeared to have contradicted the claim that the president built the Park from his own and friends funds. He said on the Spoon Talk programme on April 5, 2022, that part of the funding for the project came from state institutions. Minister Kpui said, This is the presidents project, but we also have funds coming from the National Port Authority (NPA) , National Social Security and Welfare Corporation (NASCRP) and the Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA) . Minister Kpui appeared on the show in his official capacity as chief administrator of the project and made the claim on the show between 1:19:53 to 1:20:20 hours.The show was carried live on the institutions official Facebook page . According to him, the president funded 60% of the budget for the Invincible Park, and the remaining 40% came from state coffers. Despite this contradiction, DUBAWA contacted the two senior Liberian government officials through WhatsApp to provide evidence in support of their claims that the park was built solely with funds from the president. However, the two men did not reply to DUBAWAs questions posed to them. Here are screenshots of DUBAWAs questions to Minister Samuel Tweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe. DUBAWA didnt stop there. The researcher then visited the 2022 national budget of Liberia since the project was launched in 2021. DUBAWA discovered on page 10, under the summary of the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP), that the government of Liberia funded the construction of the Invincible Sports Park Project under code 0720. The allotment for this Invincible Sports Park project is US$ 500,000 for 2022 and projected for under the 2023 and 2024 national budget at 400,000 and 320,000, respectively. Here is a screenshot from the 2022 budget of Liberia: Based on the concessions made by the Administrator of the Invincible Park project and the facts available within the 2022 national budget of Liberia, the claim made by Minister Samuel Toweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe is misleading.",1
"Claim: The Academic Staff Union of Universities has suspended its ongoing strike The claim that the university lecturers have suspended the ongoing strike is FALSE as the Union reiterates that it has no Twitter handle. On 21st November 2020, a Twitter handle @ASUUNGR_ claimed that the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has suspended its ongoing industrial action following a meeting with the federal government on November 20th, 2020 which bordered on addressing the demands of the university lecturers. The tweet which was posted at around 1:19 pm has gathered 2,552 likes and 350 retweets as of 3:18 pm ASUU strike has been suspended it posted. Subsequently, some online platforms reported the information contained in the tweet. One of such platforms is Nigerian Tracker which reported that the Union is in a meeting and may suspend the strike. University lecturers in Nigeria, on March 9th, 2020, declared a two-week warning strike to protest against the insistence of the federal government to enroll the lecturers into a new payroll software it has developed for all public officials, the Integrated Pay cash roll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). ASUU said the new payment system does not address some characteristics peculiar to the Nigerian University system. Upon the expiration of the warning strike, the union declared an indefinite strike to further their demands. This coincided with the closure of schools by the federal government to stifle the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. On one of the meetings arranged to resolve the lingering strike which has been one of the reasons students have not returned to schools after the reopening of schools as a result of the declining cases of the coronavirus pandemic, the leadership of the Union rejected the offer by the Federal Governments team to pay the salary of the lecturers and the 30b earned allowance, using IPPIS pending the roll-out of the unions preferred payment platform, University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) In a twist of events, the union had another meeting with the federal government which was seen as a major breakthrough in the effort to resolve the strike. The meeting which was held on November, 21st, 2020, saw the federal government relaxing its stance on the enrollment of the university lecturers into the new payment software, IPPIS. The Unions outstanding salaries, the government offered to pay through the old payment platform, GIFMIS, pending the outcome of the result of the integrity test to which the Unions University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) has been subjected. The federal government also offered a total sum of N65 billion to the Union to address the issue of earned allowances and funds for revitalisation of universities. To verify the claim, The ICIR contacted the national president of the Union, Prof Biodun Ogunyemi, who debunked the viral information, stating that the Union has not suspended its strike. We dont have a Twitter handle. I dont know anything about the strike suspension because we dont suspend our strike like that. He clarified pointedly. Conclusion Based on the above findings, the claim that the university lecturers have suspended the ongoing strike is FALSE as the Union reiterates that it has no Twitter handle.",0
"Over the years, Nigeria has struggled with the menace of pipeline vandalism and theft of petroleum products. This has made many of the depots of the state energy company NNPC inactive. On 10 October 2023, the NNPC revealed the four consortia that would fund the rehabilitation of pipelines. A consortium is a group of organisations, companies or individuals that come together to work on a project that may be too large or complex for any one member to do alone. The NNPC said the repair was to improve the functionality of pipelines to ensure efficient transportation of crude oil to refineries and distribution of its products nationally. But a post shared on Facebook in Nigeria claims that NNPC boss, Mele Kyari, has secretly awarded the pipeline rehabilitation contract to northern cabals. Kyari was appointed by former president Muhammadu Buhari , who is from the north, in 2019. One post reads : Nnpc Gmd Quietly Awards Control Of Nigerias Pipelines To Northern Oil cabal Ignoring Igbos. The Igbo live mainly in the countrys south. The same claim also appeared here , here and here . But is it true? In a disclaimer published on its official X (formerly Twitter) handle, the company said it had advertised the contracts and selected the four consortia according to rigorous evaluation criteria and in line with industry norms. The ownership of these strategic national assets remains with NNPC Limited, and we are fully committed to ensuring their continued operation in the interest of over 200 million Nigerians, it added . It lists the names of the companies that make up the four consortia, whose sole responsibility is to provide financial support for the project. There is no transfer of control of assets to them.",0
"Claim : A Facebook user alleged that the Liberian government has imported into the country heavy-duty trucks manufactured by Caterpillar Incorporated, a US-based company. Verdict : False. Investigations by DUBAWA have revealed that the government of Joseph Boakai has not imported any earth-moving machines as alleged. Liberias Deputy Information Minister for Technical Services, Daniel O. Sando, has told DUBAWA the claim is false. Liberias Minister of State without Portfolio, Ms Mamaka Bility, disclosed on Friday, May 24, 2024, that the government is working to procure 285 pieces of earth-moving equipment to implement its road programme. The governments road programme includes reconstructing and maintaining existing roads and building new roads and maintenance zones across 15 counties. The Minister revealed that each county would receive 19 pieces of earth-moving equipment when the equipment arrived. However, weeks after the Ministers disclosure, a Facebook user alleged that the heavy yellow machines had arrived in the country. The Facebook user wrote on June 6, 2024, that: Update now from the Freeport of Monrovia! The yellow machines bought by the JNB and JKK administration have just arrived in Liberia. Another Facebook user who reacted to the post wrote : I dont trust these Facebook posts ooo Lets hear it from the information Minister. DUBAWA decided to probe the claim as part of its campaign against misinformation and disinformation in Liberia. Liberias Deputy Information Minister for Technical Services, Daniel O. Sando, has disputed the claim on social media. The Minister told DUBAWA on June 21, 2024, that: The information is not true. The government has not even decided to purchase the road-building equipment. According to him, the government will engage the media when the decision to purchase the machines is finally reached. When there is any new development about the 285 yellow machines disclosed by the government, we will inform Liberians through the media, he said. DUBAWA further scrutinised the pictures the Facebook user shared with verification tools such as Google Reverse Image Search and TinEye. However, some of the pictures were found to have originated from a Facebook post shared by Malaysian-based construction company Macipion Global Construction Equipment on Jan. 13, 2024. Also, a Google keyword search conducted by DUBAWA showed that no reputable media organisation in Liberia reported on the arrival of the earth-moving machines. DUBAWA contacted the claimant to inquire about the source of his claim, but he has yet to respond. Based on the information gathered by DUBAWA, it is not true that the government of Liberia has brought yellow machines into the country. The researcher produced this fact-check under the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Radio Gbarnga, FM 96.5 MHz, to facilitate the spirit of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy.",1
"The claim has been made on Facebook in Nigeria that a United Nigeria plane flying from Ebonyi state to Lagos state crash-landed inside bush. The claim appears on Facebook here , here , here , here and here . The posts include a photo of what looks like the front of a small aeroplane landed in a field, with people standing around. They read : Lagos-bound Passengers Land Inside Bush After Taking Off From New Ebonyi State International Airport. Lagos is in the southwest of Nigeria, while Ebonyi is in the southeast. Many social media users reacted sympathetically to the post. United Nigeria is a private airline which began operations in 2021. But did one of their planes crash en-route from Ebonyi to Lagos? We checked. The airline said in a statement on 31 May that flight 5N-BWW from Abakaliki, the capital of Ebonyi state, landed safely at the Murtala Muhammed Airport in Lagos but skidded off the runway. Fifty passengers were on board. The aircraft landed safely but was forced to terminate its movement to the apron off the runway, the airline said. It added that all passengers disembarked safely with their baggage.

"Claim: Pictures making rounds on WhatsApp depict an acclaimed attack and destruction of the Fulani herdsmens settlement in Yewa, Ogun State. Pictures making rounds on WhatsApp that depicted attacks of Fulani settlements in Yewa, Ogun State are false. The image analysis conducted shows the images were dated and unrelated to the presented narrative. One major discourse making headlines In the Nigerian social sphere is the long-standing dispute existing between Fulani Herdsmen and farmers around the country. One headline reads Ekiti warns herdsmen, farmers against acts inimical to peace, another one says 14 feared killed by Fulani herdsmen in Delta community. Even more, a rising avalanche of concerns as regards attacks on communities, kidnappings, and killings in most parts of Nigeria is now widely referenced to the Fulani herdsmen. Furthermore, when the Governor of Ondo, Rotimi Akeredolu gave a seven-day ultimatum for Fulani herdsmen to vacate his state, the news generated heated controversy, especially when Sunday Igboho, a pro-Yoruba activist launched a campaign to chase out herdsmen from the southwestern states. As a result, surging narratives have been erupting depicting issues that relate to Mr. Sundays campaign. A typical example is some pictures going rounds on WhatsApp. The pictures claim to depict Fulani settlement in Yewa, Ogun State (Southwestern Nigeria) attacked and destroyed presumably by Sunday Igboho. Shared so many times on WhatsApp, these pictures are capable of inspiring unrest and painting the wrong narrative, especially if false. It is as a result of these realities that DUBAWA subjects this claim to analysis to uncover the truth and share the factual narrative. When DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search on the first image depicting a man amidst what appears to be dead cattles, it revealed that the image first appeared in a Wikipedia article about Global warming affecting global agriculture and food security. Apparently, it was taken out of context to now depict a false narrative about attacks on Fulani herdsmen in Yewa, Ogun state. Consequently, the second picture depicting a man amidst ruins and what appears to be dead bodies laid on the ground was in reality a picture of a reported attack carried out by herdsmen in Adamawa. The picture was shared on December 5th, 2017 in tori. ng as a news report with the headline Dead bodies everywhere: Fulani Herdsmen Attack Adamawa, Kill Many . The third picture, depicting a village under a blazing fire, first appeared on dailynigerian.com as a news report headlined Police vow to arrest suspected arsonists in Ebonyi community. The news story which featured the picture was shared on February 3rd, 2021 as regards the fire that destroyed herders houses in Oshibo community, Ebonyi Local Government Area. Pictures used to depict attacks on Fulani herdsmen in Yewa, Ogun State are unrelated to the actual event. They are swiveled out of different contexts to fertilise the already looming narrative about attacks on Fulani herdsmen in western Nigeria. This claim is false.",0
"Claim: Nigerias president, Muhammadu Buhari, is dead and has been replaced in the statehouse with a lookalike: heres a picture of the lookalike, who has now grown chubby. False. The picture is a manipulated version of Buharis official portrait as president that was released in 2015. A Facebook page that purports to be run by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, shared a picture with its over half a million followers on November 30. The post (archived here ) shows President Muhammadu Buhari but a chubbier version of the man. Buhari appears to be dead and replaced by a body double because he is wracked by the ravages of dementia ~ Farooq Kperogi November 28, 2020, he started by quoting a newspaper columnist and Associate Professor of Journalism at Kennesaw State University. He then made an oft-repeated claim by members of IPOB: All of you will keep dancing around the glaring truth that original Buhari rigged into Aso Rock in 2015 is dead and buried in a shallow grave in Saudi Arabia until you are all dead at the hands of Fulani terrorists he created and supported. Buhari is long dead. Imagine the 2020 version of your Buhari they unveiled for you gullible Nigerians last week, he added in a possible reference to the attached picture. Is this the Buhari of 2015 to you? No wonder Europeans colonised us with such ease. The post had gathered over 1,300 comments and was shared over 3,300 times as of 10 a.m. on December 8. The comments showed that not only did the pages followers believe that Buhari was dead, they also considered the picture to be authentic. The Buhari of 2015 was the best customer to hospitals. All of a sudden, this current Buhari is now as fresh and healthy as a newly born. Doesnt really add up, wrote Eze Miracle Arinzechukwu. Another follower, Tochukwu Ekpa, replied: The gullible zoologians have long lost their sense of reasoning. Even if the real Buhari whos in a shallow grave in Sadia Arabia is still alive today, its not normal for an old man to get fatter and look more young than 20 years ago. They have failed! Is this person also Buhari, because I dont understand this country anymore. How many Buhari do we have? asked Queen Isaac Emejuru. Is like this one is Buubuu not Buhari [sic]. The picture appeared on Twitter in the same period. Also on November 30, Emeka Gift had tweeted it with the caption: #BuhariMustGo and #SackTheServiceChiefs is trending because of #ZabarmariMassacre. The post had over 500 retweets as of December 8. Many of the comments again showed that the picture was considered genuine by many people. Two days earlier, the picture was uploaded by Oluchi Christy alongside three other photos of Buhari. The Buhari they are showing us on television these days is just getting fat & fatter everyday even at old age, contrary to the real Buhari in the picture 3 & 4 we have always known as slim lakpacious man from birth; till 2017 when different pictures of him began to surface on TV, she wrote. Using the reverse image search tool, TinEye, HumAngle traced the original publication of the picture of Buhari to May 17, 2015, less than two weeks to the presidential swearing-in ceremony. One of the first websites to share the picture, alongside the official portrait of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, was Abu Sidiqu . Channels TV reported on the same day that the photographs were taken by Bayo Omoboriowo, the StateCraft Inc. photographer responsible for many of the images from the recently concluded election season that culminated in Buharis victory. Omoboriowo was, soon after, appointed as Personal Photographer to the President. The original picture featured Buhari with significantly more modest body size. Original portrait of Buhari versus the manipulated picture There are readily available applications that make it possible to make people add weight in pictures, just as there are tools to make people look more skinny. One of the former apps is Fatify, which is available both for Android and iPhone users. Fatify is a fun free app that lets your face swap for a fat, jiggly, animated one. Its the best free photo booth app for Android and it makes a fat version of you with just a tap of your phones camera, states the app description on Google Play Store. Similar results can be achieved by using the liquify tool available on Adobe Photoshop, an image editing software. There is also the fat maker tool on PhotoFunia, a web-based editing app, which relies on automatic face detection. Meanwhile, checks showed that the quote attributed to Kperogi truly belonged to the US-based associate journalism professor. It was, however, used in a misleading context. The quote, Buhari appears to be dead and replaced by a body double because he is wracked by the ravages of dementia, is from an opinion piece published on November 28. But rather than support the claim favouring Buharis death, Kperogi described it as a preposterous conspiracy theory which was too silly and infantile to deserve the attention of any serious person. He also said it was implausible. In any case, Id addressed this in a December 8, 2018 column titled, Buhari: Not a Clone but a Clown, where I described it as an insanely absurd IPOB whispering campaign and as so ludicrous, so off-the-wall, and so patently illogical that even acknowledging it would be an exercise in the legitimisation of stupidity, he wrote. The truth is that even if they wanted to, Buharis inner circle is too incompetent to pull off installing a body double in Aso Rock to replace a supposedly dead Buhari. The picture is the edited version of Buharis official portrait released in May 2015. The quote from Farooq Kperogi was also used in a misleading way. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with HumAngle to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: During the official commissioning of the Office of the First Lady of Kano State, an official statement posted on the official Facebook page of the Kano State Governor claims that there are more women inclusion in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country. Findings show that Lagos and Kwara states take the lead in terms of number of cabinet composition and of percentage in relation to the National Gender Policy of 35% affirmative action of women in public governance and leadership. Deploying this as the major yardstick, we conclude that the claim is false. Kano State governor, Dr. Umar Ganduje, commissioned in August the Office of the First Lady in the state as part of his commitment to improving the life of women, strengthening their political inclusion and participation in governance. The commissioned Office of the Wife of the Governor is located at Ten Chalets section of the Government House, Kano. He said the office is dedicated to women development in Kano and as compliment to the effort of his wife, Prof. Hafsat Abdullahi Ganduje who, according to the governor, works tirelessly for their empowerment. In a statement on his Facebook page titled Office Of The Wife Of The Governor: When Readiness To Serve Came Before Office , shortly after the ceremony, the state government claimed that there are more women included in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country. Prof Hafsat Umar Ganduje has been at the forefront of campaigns for women inclusion in governance. The result is that there are more women in governance in Kano State than any other state in the country, the statement reads in part. This fact-checker tried to reach the state government to contextualise the meaning of its assertion that there are more women in governance in Kano than any other state, but the effort was abortive as calls put through to the Press Secretary to the Kano State Government, Abba Anwar, were not answered. Follow up SMS and WhatsApp messages were also not responded to. However, Fatima Musa Aliyu, the Acting Executive Director, Bridge Connect Africa Initiative (BCAI) , an organization focusing on womens rights and girl child education among others, explains that indicators for women inclusion are usually judged based on the specific focus of a program. If you say an economic programme for example, you would be looking at indicators like, is there a task force in the team, if there is, what is the gender balance, if it is in the workplace, are there provisions for menstrual pads, is there maternity leave and so on, she explains. However, in terms of governance and inclusion, she said that cabinet composition is a key indicator: In this case, you would be looking at how many women commissioners are there in the cabinet, what is the composition of the top tier management who take decisions on behalf of women, how many percent of the appointment goes to the women, these are all things about governance and inclusion that are indicators. People would want to look more at the executive positions, because it is a reflection of the society in terms of gender bias and every other thing . Based on the foregoing yardstick, findings by PRNigeria show that on 5th November, 2019, the Kano State Government swore in its 21 member state executive council and assigned portfolios to them with only two females Dr. Zaharau Umar as Commissioner of Women Affairs and Dr. Mariya Mahmoud Bunkure as Commissioner of Higher Education making the cabinet, representing only 9.52% of the cabinet makeup which is far below the formulated National Gender Policy of 35% affirmative action of women in public governance and leadership. Further checks show that states like Lagos have a higher number of women (14) in their cabinet and Gov. Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State was recognized for being the first state governor to include 14 women in his cabinet representing 40% of the cabinet make up. Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin , a Nigerian womens rights activist, president of the human rights groups, Women Arise for Change Initiative and the Campaign for Democracy has in reaction to that, urged other state governors to emulate Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State by ensuring an increased number of women in their cabinets. NAN reports that Gov. Sanwo-Olu had in August 2019 inaugurated 35 commissioners and special advisers into the state executive council out of which 12 were women. One of the three governors nominees, who was declined confirmation by the Lagos State House of Assembly, was also a woman making the number 13. The governor had earlier appointed a woman, Mrs Folashade Jaji, as the Secretary to the State Government bringing the number of women to 14 altogether. Similarly, in March 2020, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, Governor of Nigerias north-central Kwara State, was reported to have gone down in history as the first African leader with the highest number of female cabinet members and political appointees. This is because nine of his 16-person cabinet picks are women, way higher than the 35% affirmative action sought by the Beijing Declaration. Even though the total number of cabinet make up varies between 16 and 35 depending on states in terms of number of women appointees, Lagos remains ahead (14) followed by Kwara (9) but in terms of percentage based on total number of cabinet members, Kwara is ahead with 52.25% followed by Lagos with 40% while Kano (9.52%) lags behind on both factors. Furthermore, out of the 36 States in Nigeria, only 4 have Deputy Governors that are women namely; Ogun State: Mrs Salako-Oyedele Noimot Olurotimi Rivers: Mrs Ipalibo Gogo Banigo Kaduna: Mrs Hadiza Balarabe Enugu: Mrs Cecilia Ezeilo This is approximately 12% representation and below the 35% affirmative action for gender inclusion in Nigeria, and Kano is nowhere near the record. A cursory view of State Cabinets across geopolitical zones reveals the following statistics from six samples of each geopolitical zone in terms of gender inclusion. The Lagos State cabinet led by Governor Babajide Sanwoolu has thirty-five (35) members with 14 female members. This represents a 40% gender inclusion level which is commendable and above the 35% affirmation agenda. From the Akwa Ibom State cabinet which has 21 members, only two (2) women made the list which in terms of percentage distribution is about 10.5%. In Imo State Governor Emeka Ihedioha inaugurated his 17-man cabinet with two(2) women making the list like Akwa Ibom state. This translates to 8.5% in terms of gender distribution in the cabinet. Governor Nasir El-Rufai inaugurated his 11-man cabinet which has four(4) women in the list. This number shows that the gender representation is 27.5% The Borno state cabinet has 22 members and out of the executive council, there are two (2) women in the list. This by gender representation is 11% and again very low when it comes to 35% affirmation in terms of participation in governance. From the North-Central with focus on Benue State, Governor Samuel Ortoms 15-man cabinet, has two (2) women in the list like Akwa-Ibom, Borno and Imo states. This makes a gender representation of 7.5% which is far behind the 35% affirmative action. Lawyers, journalists, gender rights activists and political scientists in Kano all confirm that the state is not the most gender inclusive state in Nigeria in terms of governance as claimed. Zainab Nasir Ahmad, a gender rights activist and executive director Youth Society for the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Social Vices (YOSPIS), thinks gender inclusion in Kano State is a great challenge. From the side of women I can say the chances are not there as they are suppose to be, the female gender is struggling because of lack of support people that can pushed them up. On the other hand, the current kano state Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, once narrated how some women were denied top positions because how tasking the job is and there are complaints from the married women based on the reasons that they cant leave their husbands to actively participate in public space due to cultural barriers, Zainab said. Another women rights activist and reporter with Guarantee FM Kano, Hannatu Sulaiman Abba, blames the situation on misconceived religious perceptions and societal norms. Many women have been bullied, mocked and embarrassed just because they go into politics as a career, Hannatu quipped. But Barrister Nura Ahmad Muhammad, a Lawyer and founder of Mufarka Youth Initiative, explains this further, saying the expectation upon every woman in Hausa Land is to be a good wife, decent, chaste and obedient. It is a restriction in the eyes of the modern world but culturally alright in the Hausa community, this is cultural relativism. What is important is to keep adjusting culturally in terms of womens engagements in Hausa land, accepting changes that are morally good and important to our day to day activities. Moving with time and accepting changes facilitates progress. At the same time we need to preserve our culture, package it well, showcase it globally and always be proud of it. Our culture is our identity, we cant afford to lose it, he stated. Nigeria is Africas largest and most densely populated nation with over 180 million people of over 250 ethnic groups. According to the World Data report in 2017, the population of women was 94.2m, constituting over 45% of the population. This shows that women in terms of population spread are critical in the development of the nation. This is not reflected as expected in the distribution or participation of women in sectors like energy, business, banking, capital market, health, politics, governance and technology etc. In terms of percentage of inclusion in line with the 35% affirmative action and even in terms of total number of cabinet make up, Kano State is not the most women inclusive state in governance as claimed by the state government. Deploying this as the major yardstick, we conclude that the claim is false. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with PRNnigeria to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: Several graphics shared on users WhatsApp statuses claimed that President Bola Tinubu plans to reduce the monthly allowance allocated to members of the Nigerian Youth Service Corps (NYSC). Verdict: The information is false. The newly inaugurated President made no such statement. Months after his victory at the February 2023 general election, President Bola Tinubu was sworn into office on May 29 to succeed Muhammadu Buhari as Nigerias 5th democratically elected president since 1999. But the country currently battles economic crises on different fronts due to Buharis activities while in office, leaving the nation in heavy debts that have never been recorded in the nations history. To cushion the effect and steady the tides, one of the first announcements the newly-inaugurated president made was the abolition of the fuel subsidy, which plunged the nation into panic barely hours into the start of his administration. This, perhaps, influenced beliefs that he also reduced the monthly allowance received by corps members in the country from N33,000 during the previous administration in 2020 to N25,000, as seen in this picture. The images posted on WhatsApp statuses had some authenticity elements, as the graphics were designed like breaking news from a broadcast organisation. Another example is shown below. However, closer attention to Tinubus inauguration revealed that he made no such statement in his speech. To clear the air, we decided to verify the source of the graphics. After critically assessing the pictures, we discovered one common trait: the watermark on both graphics. The watermark reads, breakyourownnews.com, which indicates a website where users can alter a news article for mischievous purposes. DUBAWA also ran a keyword search using the watermarks words, which led us to a fact-check of a claim that used a similar tool. Also, a transcript of Tinubus inaugural speech that we obtained revealed no such information. Neither did credible media organisations report that the president made such a statement. Also, such information does not exist on his social media or other related stakeholders. President Tinubu has not stated that he plans to reduce the monthly allowance given to members of the NYSC. Therefore, the claim is false.",0
"Claim : Spy Liberia (a blog) posted on Facebook claimed that Monrovia is the dirtiest city in the world. Verdict : False! Research shows that Monrovia is not among the top dirtiest cities in the world. Research reveals that New Delhi is the worlds dirtiest city. Waste management is a challenge in Liberia. Air pollution, plastic pollution, and general waste circulation in certain parts of the city affect the environment, marine life, and wildlife. While the national government, civil society actors, and environmentalists make substantial efforts to curtail this challenge, much remains to be done. Based on this circumstance, SPY Liberia (a blog), on Feb 14, 2025, claimed that Monrovia is the dirtiest city in the world. The poster said, Visit Liberia, the dirtiest capital city in the world. Monrovia. Screenshot of claim above The claim generated 313 reactions, 456 comments, and 52 shares. The comments on the claim varied. Some aligned with the allegation, while others disagreed. For the sake of clarity, DUBAWA opted to conduct a fact check. A screenshot of comments below To verify this claim, DUBAWA researched the dirtiest cities in the world. In the search, we discovered that Monrovia is not among the top ten dirtiest cities in the world. A 2024 data by World Air Quality shows that New Delhi is the most polluted city in the world. The statistics on page 11 of the World Air Quality 2024 report on the most polluted cities in the world found Indias capital, New Delhi, as number one, followed by NDjamena in Chad. Screenshot below Further reports by Al Jazeera , Prana Ai r, and Times of India reveal that New Delhi is the worlds most polluted city. During our verification, we found that Monrovia is not mentioned in these reports. Screenshot below Based on our findings, Monrovia is not the dirtiest city in the world, so the claim is false.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user via a video post claimed that Fulani terrorists from different countries have invaded Nigeria to initiate mass killing. Verdict : Misleading! Credible media reports indicate that the Nigeria Police Force has debunked the claim as false, and there are no matching reports to prove that the claim emanated from the BBC, as the Facebook user claimed via post. Terrorism in Nigeria has a long history and remains a significant global issue affecting both the country and other nations. Predominantly in the northern region, incidents involving Boko Haram and the Fulani herdsmen crisis have resulted in the loss of lives and destruction of properties in the affected areas. Recently, a Facebook user, Critical Thinkers , shared a video showing heavily armed suspected terrorists in a forest with the claim that they were recently deployed to Nigeria for mass killing. Breaking, BBC NEWS that Fulani arrived in Nigeria from all other African countries to start mass killing in (Nigeria), the posts caption reads. The post shared on Friday, Sep. 13, 2024, has since generated about six likes, comments, and one repost as of Sunday, Sep. 22, 2024. By observing some of the comments passed on the post, DUBAWA noticed that users believed the post to be accurate. Recognising the need for security awareness to prevent the spread of disinformation among Nigerians, DUBAWA decided to verify this information. DUBAWA carried out a Google reverse image search on some screenshots from the video. The result led us to different posts made in July 2024 with the same video and similar captions. The post can be found here and here . Probing further, DUBAWA investigated the claimants assertion that the video was authenticated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). A Google search using the keyword BBC recent report in Nigeria was conducted, and all of the corporations September reports were reviewed, but none supported the claimants assertion. Meanwhile, while conducting a keyword search to verify the videos authenticity, we found several reports from credible media organisations. Vanguard reported on June 27, 2024, that the Nigeria police had debunked the viral video, which claimed to have happened in 2018. The video was manipulated to generate panic and fear among Nigerian citizens and residents. Similarly, the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) reported a similar story on June 27, 2024. Moreover, we found a post by the Nigeria Police Force on Jun. 26, 2024, via their official X handle debunking the claim as misleading. Part of the post reads, After thorough and detailed video graphic analysis conducted by the NPF Cybercrime Centre, it has been confirmed that the video in question was created and circulated on 28th May 2018. Our findings reveal that the video was recently reposted with a misleading narrative and deliberate intention to cause unnecessary panic and disruption within the country, the police force wrote. Moreover, a search for any recent report by credible media outlets also showed no report of Fulanis invading Nigerias territory for mass killings. Our Findings show that the users shared video is misleading, and the evidence available shows no BBC reports corroborating the claimants assertion.",1
"Claim: The Unity Party National (UP) Campaign Spokesperson, Mo Ali, alleged on his Facebook page that the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) government is plotting to rig the run-off election in their favour with the help of ECOWAS Election Observers. Verdict: False! In another post, Mo Ali clarified that no disbursement was made to ECOWAS to rig the election. Also, ECOWAS Election Observers debunked the claim in a disclaimer. The opposition UP National Campaign Spokesperson, Mo Ali, on Nov. 10, 2023, on his official Facebook page, alleged that the CDC government is plotting to rig the election run-off with the help of election observers. See the screenshot below: According to Mo Ali, stewards of the Coalition for Democratic Change, in a meeting with the National Elections Commission (NEC) and ECOWAS election observers, disbursed USD$150,000 to concede the NECs biased result. At about this afternoon, the very top echelon of the CDC government met and discussed the runoff election and its outcome. In the meeting, they agreed that they cant win against the UP. Hence, they want to prevail on the NEC commissioners to announce results in their (CDC) favour. As part of the plan, they have disbursed US$150,000 (US$ one hundred fifty thousand) to ECOWAS Delegates here to monitor the elections. The money to the ECOWAS Delegates is intended to induce them to quickly endorse the fake results by stating that such a rigged process was free, fair and credible. We want to assure our people that this will be thwarted and their votes will be protected. The NEC will announce the vote results as they were cast by our people. Mo Alis allegation questioned the integrity of the International Community. Supporters of the Unity Party believed the content disseminated by Mo Ali, but those from the Coalition for Democratic Change considered it a reckless statement. This led DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA contacted Mo Ali for evidence to support his claim. Although he has yet to respond, the UP Steward clarified through his official Facebook page on Nov. 12, 2023, admitting no disbursement was made to ECOWAS Election Observers as claimed in his previous post. On November 10, 2023, I made a post relative to the Government of Liberia allegedly disbursing US$150,000 to ECOWAS Delegates to affirm would be rigged results from the runoff elections. Our findings have shown that the Government of Liberia did meet and make a plan to disburse the said amount. However, it is important to clarify that NO CONTACT was made with ECOWAS ELECTION MONITORS and NO DISBURSEMENT OF CASH was made to them, Mo Ali said. Continuing his post, he applauded the ECOWAS for their services offered in Liberia. We applaud ECOWAS for their continuing contribution to the consolidation of our democracy, and we call on them to incessantly work in such direction, Mo Ali said. Furthermore, ECOWAS Election Observers, on Nov. 11, 2023, released a disclaimer on the allegation made. The ECOWAS Observer Mission to the Presidential election in Liberia has noted with regret, a reckless statement made by Mo Ali, National Campaign Spokesperson of the Unity Party, on his Facebook post of November 10, 2023, stating that the ECOWAS Observer Mission had been influenced by USD 150,000 to declare a purportedly rigged election as transparent free and fair. The ECOWAS Observer Mission takes strong exception to this scurrilous statement, which puts at risk the safety and physical integrity of the ECOWAS Observers from across West Africa who have come to accompany the good people of Liberia in this pivotal election. The ECOWAS Observer Mission calls on the leadership of the Unity Party to denounce the statement made by its National Campaign Spokesperson that seeks to denigrate the image of ECOWAS, the press statement reads. In the post, ECOWAS challenged Mr Ali to provide evidence to support his claim or withdraw his accusation against the international body. The ECOWAS Observer Mission challenges Mo Ali to prove this scurrilous accusation or publicly withdraw it immediately and tender an unqualified apology. Failing this, the ECOWAS Observer Mission and the ECOWAS Commission reserve the right to employ all necessary measures to hold him personally accountable for his utterance. From the evidence gathered, it is apparent that the claim made by Unity Party Spokesperson Mo Ali is false.",0
"A video circulating on Facebook in Nigeria since July 2024 claims that tiger nut drinks can cause cholera. The videos caption reads : CHOLERA IS A KILLER DISEASE ... BEWARE OF TIGERNUT DRINK. It shows a woman holding a bottle of what she claims is a tiger nut drink. She warns Nigerians not to drink it, saying it is the cause of the cholera outbreak in Lagos state. She can be heard saying: It has been confirmed by the Ministry of Health in Laos state that tiger nut is the root cause of the recent Lagos cholera outbreak that has killed over 100 people Cholera is an acute infection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . The disease is characterised by severe diarrhoea and rapid loss of body fluids and salts. It can be fatal if left untreated. Tiger nuts , despite their name, are the tubers, or root, of a grass-like plant. They are nutritious and contain healthy fats, protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Grown all over the world, they are also known as underground walnuts and can be blended and packaged into drinks. Similar posts can be found here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But do tiger nut drinks cause cholera? We checked. Cholera outbreak in Nigeria In June, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention declared cholera a public health emergency . By 21 July , 4,809 suspected cases of cholera and 156 deaths had been reported in 35 states. In Lagos alone, there have been 3,126 suspected cases. Meanwhile, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation has announced that it will be delivering vaccines to Nigeria to help control the ongoing outbreak. Safely prepared tiger nut drinks wont cause cholera Kemi Ogunyemi is reported to have said that unregistered tiger nut drinks were the cause of the cholera outbreak in Lagos state. She is the special adviser to the Lagos state governor on health. However, the state government has since clarified the matter, saying Ogunyemi was misrepresented . According to the state government, Ogunyemi said the state is investigating everything including water, food and drinks. There is no conclusion yet. Africa Check contacted Beatrice Ogunba , a professor of public health nutrition at Obafemi Awolowo University in Osun state. She said: Tiger nut drinks are healthy drinks that can be used as a substitute for sugar-sweetened beverages. However, consumption of tiger nut fruit or drink cannot cause cholera unless it has been contaminated during processing by the water used to process and wash the nuts. Ogunba also said that handling tiger nuts with unwashed hands could transfer bacteria to the drink. She advised the manufacturers of the drinks to be hygienic. The Facebook posts suggesting that tiger nut drinks cause cholera are misleading. Similar posts can also be seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"Claim: A sponsored page on Facebook with the name BBC News Nigeria is seeking Nigerians audience and asking them to invest their money for a double return on their investment. The page is not owned by BBC or Vanguard as its owner wants the social media audience to believe. Besides, there is nothing like BBC News Nigeria whether as an existing entity or as a media house in Nigeria. The BBC New Nigeria page is fake. A fraudulent group which identified itself as CROWD 1 has been calling on Nigerians to register and invest their money, promising higher Return on Investment (ROI). The group, which claimed it was created to provide support both for the rich and poor in order to help them financially is running its fraudulent activities with a sponsored Facebook page identified as BBC News Nigeria. While assuring that investment is 100% money secured, the page is directing interested users to join a Whatsapp group or call the admin of the investment scheme. WELCOME TO CROWD 1.

They are 100% money secured!!! It was created to support financially is both for the rich and poor, the post of the group read accompanied with the video showing John Okafor, a Nigerian comic thespian, popularly known as Mr Ibu. Dubawa conducted an overall check on the page and discovered that contrary to its name BBC News Nigeria, it is not an original BBC News page or a media company. Besides, there is no single report except two videos one of them showing a Nollywood actor, Kelvin Ikeduba, explaining why people should invest their money. The actor, arguably, is serving as an ambassador of the ponze group identified as Crowd 1 investment. This is a known culture in Nigeria whereby celebrities and social media influencers are used to sell a product, promote brands or project or change peoples orientation towards an opinion, idea and ideology. When Dubawa checked the photo section of the page, three pictures bearing Breaking News were found. One of them has a striking resemblance to BBC News, a global digital news and broadcasting agency. While it is apparently clear that the page does not belong to the real BBC, its owner, Crowd 1, uses the media organisations image and logo brand to serve as a clickbait. This, it is assumed, will draw the attention of targeted social media audiences to the page. Similarly, the fraudulent attempt is to give the ponzi schemes page a credibility boost, make people believe that it is owned by BBC News and lure them to the videos which, perhaps, may convince them to join the investment group. Dubawa notes there is no media agency in Nigeria with the name BBC News Nigeria. There, however, is BBC Africa, a subsidiary of British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) which has its tentacles in African continent. In Nigeria, four languages are available on the BBC platform, namely: BBC Pidgin, BBC Hausa, BBC Igbo and BBC Yoruba. There is nothing like BBC News Nigeria. This suggests that the page is bogus and a clickbait. A further search by Dubawa showed that the Crowd 1 investment also runs another sponsored Facebook page to promote its activities, promising double profit of investment in two hours. Although it uses the name Ibitomi , the page uses the logo/favicon of Vanguard newspaper, a Nigerian news publication, for the same clickbait reason. V letter with a deep colour-touch of red is the logo of Vanguard newspaper as shown below. On the page is another video of actor, Kelvin Ikeduba, assuring prospective investors of high ROI after investment. Part of caption under the video reads: We are 100% money secure. It is an approved platform that gives you double of your investment within 2hours time. Invest now and thank me later. Without any iota of doubt, this is a desperate ploy to lure people into the investment scheme using all possibly available baits. Apart from promising higher ROI, Ponzi or investment schemes are deploying different methods to convince social media users to join them. In the case of the one discussed above, there is a desperate attempt to mislead the social media audience using the name, image and reputation of notable media organisations. The BBC New Nigeria page is fake.

"Claim: An X user alleged that the US government had restricted Wizkid from entering America after assaulting his girlfriend. Verdict: False! A check by DUBAWA showed that the video is a deep fake generated by artificial intelligence. Full Text Recently, Nigerian superstar singers Ayodeji Balogun, better known as Wizkid, and David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, ign ited another round of their long-standing supremacy via a tense exchange of words on social media. Media reports indicated that a leaked video of Davido on his knees, crying and begging an alleged woman for sex. The Ojuelegba crooner had seemingly suggested his fans needed to plead for a new song as intensely as the person in the video (implying Davido). With this ongoing bickering, fans of both singers have emerged online to attack one another. One such story, shared by an X user identified as @Successful101, depicts Joe Biden, the incumbent American president, saying that Wizkid has been banned from entering the country. Nigerian artiste Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun, popularly known as Wizkid, has been suspended from coming to the USA for beating his girlfriend Jada in California. Please, all the immigration all over the US states should be aware of this. Said by me US president Joe Biden, the supposed president said in the clip. As of May 22, 2024, the post had amassed 8,000 views, 700 reposts, and 621 bookmarks. The comment section was inundated with different views, some suggesting the photo was real while others raised questions. The video has also emerged on TikTok here . In the Twitter post, some users commented that they agreed with it, while many others said that the video was made with artificial intelligence technology. A user @Ojodale46 wrote: Wizkid life don spoil finish. Another user questioned: Why does this look like AI edited [sic]? DUBAWA resolved to investigate the authenticity of the image due to the potential disinformation it poses and its widespread attention. DUBAWA searched Google for any related report to the alleged video, but none was found. Further search shows that Jade Pollock [mentioned in the video], a love partner and talent manager to Wizkid, once accused the singer of assault in July 2019. This incident happened years before Joe Biden became president of America, and the Trump-led administration and immigration authorities did not react to it. DUBAWA further observed that the audio and the mouth movements dont match. This inconsistency suggests that the video has some deep-ware effects, which means its AI-generated. This was confirmed when the video was on Deepware , and the result said the clip contained a high level of deep-ware effects. Our findings show this video is AI-generated while events of Wizkids assault on her partner did not occur recently as claimed in the clip. The claim is false.",0
"A post on Facebook is offering investment plans to Nigerians to double their money in just 45 minutes. The post, dated 1 July 2023, reads : ""GOOD DAY MY DEAR FAMILY AND FRIEND'S I want to introduce you all to a paying and a legitimate platform which I joined.. This is a platform that gives you double of your initial investment within 45minutes after investing."" It also says the poster made an investment of N150,000 and received N300,000 in return on the OctaFX trading platform. Similar posts have been shared here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . But is this investment offer to be trusted? We checked. OctaFX is a business platform that helps Forex traders make trading decisions. Forex refers to foreign exchange , a global marketing place for exchanging money from one currency to another. People buy currencies when they are cheaper and sell them at higher prices to make profits. Those who are in this business are called Forex traders. This is the official website of OctaFX, with links to its Facebook and Twitter pages. The platform has over 500,000 followers on Facebook and is verified on Twitter. In May 2023, news site the Punch reported that OctaFX had seen a rise in fraudulent activity in the platform's name. It has urged its clients to be wary of scammers unlawfully using the OctaFX brand to scam them. The platform says it has never promised a sure profit, emphasising that the Forex trading results depend largely on the trader. This model varies from what is promised in the posts found on Facebook, offering double profits in 45 minutes. Africa Check has previously debunked similar investment schemes asking Nigerians to invest and double their money within an hour. An unusually short timeline for profit is a red flag. The post includes a WhatsApp link where those who are interested can send a message. Directing users to WhatsApp is common in investment scams.

"On Tuesday, Jan 7, 2025, Metas CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the companys decision to terminate its third-party fact-checking programme, starting in the United States. Before this discontinuation , Meta had been using the services of independent fact-checking organisations to moderate content on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Under this project, Meta partnered with fact-checking organisations like DUBAWA to identify potentially untrue information across its platforms, conduct fact-checks, and report such content. This made it easier for Meta to flag misleading or false posts. Meta announced that it would replace fact-checkers with a community notes system after discontinuing the project. In place of traditional fact-checkers, this new approach would allow users to provide context under posts that may contain false or misleading narratives. That is then used to flag what content is true or false. While community notes are not a strange feature to X users, they may be new to some users of Metas products. Here are six key questions that will help you understand this tool better, along with some relatable explanations. 1. What is the purpose of community notes? According to X, Reddit, and Wikipedia, which have already adopted this user-generated content moderation model, the purpose of community notes is to fight misinformation. On X, this tool lets users add clarifying notes to tweets that might be misleading or incorrect. Imagine you see a tweet claiming your favourite celebrity did something outrageous without any proof. With community notes, someone can step in and provide the facts or context needed to set the record straight. This way, everyone gets access to better information and can make more informed decisions. However, despite the use of community notes on X, misleading or false information is still shared on a daily basis. 2. Who can contribute to community notes? Whether its a casual user or an expert on a topic, Notes lets anyone add their voice to a conversation. In other words, if you spot a post that seems off, you can write a note to help clarify things. Think of it as being in a group project where everyone pitches in their knowledge to improve the final product. This open participation encourages different viewpoints and makes discussions richer and more informative. Apart from being trained professionals, fact-checkers often interview experts and deploy technological tools when verifying information. The downside of community notes is that users with little to no knowledge about a subject matter are also allowed to determine what information the public considers true or false. 3. How are contributions currently evaluated? One way platforms like X attempt to manage community notes is by allowing other users to upvote or downvote notes based on how useful they think they are. If you find a note helpful, you can give it an upvote. If it doesnt add much value, you can as well downvote it. This system helps highlight the best contributions so that when youre scrolling through tweets, you can easily spot the most reliable information. Whether this evaluation method is effective or not might be another question to ask. 4. How do users access Notes? On X, once a note gets enough votes from the community, it becomes visible right below the original tweet. This means if you see something questionable pop up in your feed, you can quickly check for any notes that clarify or correct it. 5. What are the benefits of Notes? According to its developers, community notes goal is to foster a sense of involvement and trust among users and enhance critical thinking skills. However, apart from being a political move, Zuckerberg sees the adoption of community notes as a way to ensure more freedom of speech. 6. Does community notes have any limitations? Several individuals have argued that community notes has several limitations that affect its effectiveness in addressing misinformation. According to Alex Mahadevan, the MediaWise Director at the Poynter Institute, one major issue is that around 60 per cent of the most-rated notes never become public, meaning many crucial clarifications go unseen. Additionally, for a note to be displayed, it must achieve consensus across the political spectrum, which is challenging in todays polarised environment. This often leaves important notes unpublished. The delay in publishing notes also hinders timely responses to misinformation, limiting the overall impact of the feature.",0
"Claim: On its official Facebook page, the Nasarawa State Government, posted a picture of a before and after construction of a road it claims to be in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba Local Government Council, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. Analysis shows that the after image was truly that of Sisinbaki-Kwarra road in Wamba Local Government Council. The before was, however, an image of a road under construction in Camaari Metropolitan Road in Lauro de Freitas, Brazil back in 2015. As such, this claim is misleading. Social media has become an acceptable part of our daily lives. While there are ongoing debates about the efficacy of information that floods the platform, organisations and sectors continually use the social media space to promote their agenda and activities. It is in light of this reality that the official Facebook page of Nasarawa State Government, shared a before and after picture of a road it claims to be in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba Local Government Council, Nasarawa State Nigeria. The Facebook page has over 13 000 followers and contains thousands of other pictures that convey the achievements of the state governor, Engineer Abdullahi Sule. The governor, who is an entrepreneur and businessman, was elected in 2019 Governorship elections under the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC). The Facebook page captures his achievements since assuming office. Comments on the page show that many depend on the page for authentic news about the state and take it as a reliable source. For instance, a user wrote this in praise of the page: It brings to the people what the government is doing with(out) any distortion but as it is. How true is this particular information from the page? The post, which presents the picture of the before and after road construction, attracted over 200 reactions and over 70 re-shares. Even more, the same picture with apparently the same narrative featured on other Facebook users pages and also on Twitter. For example, a user, Akashe Abdullahi Ari (@AkasheAri) on Twitter tweeted a picture of the road with the caption: Before and after construction of 15.5km Sissinbaki-Kwarra Road in Wamba. Thank you, Governor Engr. Abdullahi A. Sule. However, not convincing enough for some users, they challenged the authenticity of the picture. In Wamba Nah halfway to Ibrahim commented. Also, another user, Joan, who doubted the picture challenged that the picture of the road above is not in Nasarawa State. This is not true. Nasarawa State is a state in the North Central region of Nigeria, bordered to the east by the states of Taraba and Plateau, to the north by Kaduna State, to the south by the states of Kogi and Benue, and to the west by the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. To verify the before picture in the acclaimed narrative, a Yandex reverse image was conducted to trace the actual source of the acclaimed before picture of the road. The Yandex results show the picture was first used in 2015 in a report that details the construction of the Camaari Metropolitan Road in Lauro de Freitas, Brazil. A screenshot of the actual source of the acclaimed Before image of the road on Jornal Grande Bahia In fact, the Newspaper Grand Bahia, a leading publication in Brazil, reported on several levels of the roads construction. Even more, the article credited the picture to Mateus Pereira of the Jornal Grande Bahia. The current Governor of Nasarawa State, Engineer Abdullahi Sule, to whom the alleged road was referenced, came into office in 2019, while the before image of the road has been in existence since 2015 as uncovered in the Jornal Grande Bahia. Thus, the alleged image used to depict the before conditions of the road in Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba local government council, Nasarawa state Nigeria, is false. When a google reverse image search of the alleged after conditions of the road was conducted, results from multiple credible news sources show the image was truly that of the Sisinbaki-Kwarra, Wamba local government council, Nasarawa state Nigeria. In a news story by Eggonnews, the governor was reported to commission the Sisinbaki-Kwarra road in Wamba local government council, Nasarawa State Nigeria, on May 22, 2021. In another report by Afridailynews, the governor was also reported to commission the same Sisinka-Kwarra road on the same day as that of the initial report, May 22, 2021. Both reports featured the image of the road after completion. Even more, one image shared on Afridailynews showed the governor beside a signpost with the details of the Sisinbaki/Kwarra road project. Not entirely convinced, DUBAWA visited the location to further verify the claim. Findings at the location revealed that the purported after picture of the road is actually true of the road project. Community members who confirmed the claim admitted that the before picture of the road is nowhere near their environment; however, they ascertained that the after picture was genuine and even took DUBAWA to the actual location. John Joel, a member of the Sisinbaki community who took DUBAWA around, said that the claim by the state government is indeed misleading. The before picture is not from this part, this is not anywhere in Sisinbaki/Kwarra axis. I was here before and after and I cant recall this location. But the after is true, I even know the location, and I can take you to the exact place. Similarly, Abdullahi Muhammad, a bike rider who acknowledged the same narrative offered to take this reporter to the location. DUBAWAs findings uncovered that the Sisinbaki/Kwarra road project was actually constructed and even commissioned in 2021 by Mr Sule. However, the picture shared to depict the after and before condition of the road is misleading. Further attempts made to contact the Facebook page for Nasarawa State government for comments proved unfruitful. Neither the messages sent on Facebook, nor the ones sent via email address provided on the page were replied to. Likewise, calls and messages placed to two of the governors media aides were also not responded to as of the time this report was filed. While DUBAWA has uncovered that the before picture of the acclaimed completed Sisinka/Kwarra road in Wamba LGC, Nasarawa State is false and extracted from another location, the after picture is truly that of the completed road project. The claim by the state government is misleading. This fact-check was produced by DUBAWA in partnership with Code for Africas PesaCheck, with support from ICFJ.",0
"Lagos, Nigerias commercial capital, has recently experienced a cholera outbreak, which has resulted in nearly 500 suspected cases and several deaths. Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal disease caused by Vibrio cholerae, a primarily waterborne bacterium. The disease can spread rapidly in areas with inadequate access to clean water and poor sanitation. On June 23, 2024, a TikTok user, @leeleeyancontentcreator, posted a video claiming that the Lagos State Ministry of Health had confirmed tiger nuts as the root cause of the cholera outbreak. The video has garnered over 18,000 views, 378 shares, and 345 likes. The user urged viewers to discard any Tiger nut drinks they had. The transcribed message reads: Where are my tiger nut drink lovers? E don happen again. Oh, please avoid tiger nut drinks for now. In fact, if you have tiger nuts in your fridge like me, I beg you to trash it ASAP. This is no joke. Please treat it as important. It has been confirmed by the Ministry of Health Lagos state that tiger nuts are the root cause of the recent Lagos cholera outbreak that has killed over a hundred people. Record that Lagos is under the grip of a vicious cholera outbreak. The monster has swept across the 20 local governments of the state, with Ajeromi, Epe, Ikorodu, Alimosho, and Eti-osa having the highest cases as of Friday, 21st June 2024. Lagos has recorded 24 deaths, 35 confirmed cases, and 417 suspected cases of cholera. Aside from Lagos, 30 other Nigerian states such as Oyo, Ogun, Cross River, and Kano are also experiencing an outbreak of the intestinal illness. In an exclusive report by Punch Newspaper, Dr Kemi Ogunyemi, the special advisor to the Lagos state governor on health, confirmed that tiger nut drinks are the primary cause of the outbreak in Lagos state Claim 1: The Lagos State Government has confirmed tiger nuts as the root cause of the recent cholera outbreak in Lagos. Verdict: MISLEADING. The Lagos State officials statement was misinterpreted. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search and found that this claim might have originated from an exclusive interview with Ms Ogunyemi, the special adviser to the Lagos State Government on health, published on June 22nd in Punch Newspaper . During the interview, Ms Ogunyemi was quoted as saying: We carried out a survey and found that the common denominator, which was one of the deadly factors, was a tiger nut drink. People who came to the hospitals all identified that they had drunk tiger nut drink. We couldnt just take their word for it, so we had to take that drink and test it to see what was in it. We immediately sent people out to look for those selling it so we could take a sample. We found empty bottles with a name on them, but we discovered that it wasnt even registered with the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, the regulatory body that ensures the safety of consumables. From our investigations, we realised that the beverages were not registered, so the producers hadnt gone through the processes to ensure that what they were producing was safe for the public to consume. We traced it to that. Of course, cholera is also water-borne, so we took samples of the water to test it. Further search led to a response from the Director of Public Affairs at the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Tunbosun Ogunbanwo, published by Premium Times newspaper. Ogunbanwo clarified that Ms Ogunyemis comments were misinterpreted and that she did not provide any conclusions about the causes of the outbreak. He noted that multiple potential sources, including Tiger nut drinks, were under investigation. Claim 2: The Cholera death toll in Nigeria had surpassed one hundred. Verdict: FALSE. As of the time of this report, data show that only 53 deaths have been recorded. The video contained significant inaccuracies, particularly the misrepresentation of figures. The claimant asserted, without evidence or reference to any credible source, that the cholera death toll in Nigeria had surpassed one hundred. However, a check on the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) verified that X handle, @NCDCgov, indicated otherwise as of June 25, 2024. The NCDC post reads : As of 24th June 2024, a total of 1,528 suspected cases and 53 deaths have been recorded Claim 3: Ajeromi, Epe, Ikorodu, Alimosho, and Eti-Osa have the highest cases. Verdict: FALSE. The graphical representation of the Local Government Areas affected in Lagos traced to the verified X handle of the Lagos Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, as of June 20, 2024, shows Lagos Island, Kosofe, Lagos Mainland, and Eti-Osa as areas hit with high recorded cases. Claim 4: Theres been an outbreak of cholera in Kano. Verdict: FALSE. There is no outbreak of cholera in Kano. The claim that Kano recorded an outbreak was found to be false, as confirmed on June 26, 2024, to journalists via a press release by the Public Relations Officer, Ministry of Health, Kano, Ibrahim Abdullahi. To confirm whether Tiger nuts natural properties can be hazardous to human health, DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on the plants health implications. Studies ( here and here ) indicate that tiger nuts are known for their numerous health benefits, as they are rich in fiber, vitamins E and C, potassium, and magnesium. They also have antioxidant properties, support digestive health, help control blood sugar levels, and may improve heart health. While the fibrous nature of tiger nuts can cause bloating and gas, especially in individuals with digestive disorders, there is no evidence that their natural content can cause cholera. Dr Olayinka Badmus, Deputy Project Director of Risk Communication and Community Engagement at USAID-funded Breakthrough ACTION Nigeria, analysed the supposed statement made by Dr Kemi Ogunyemi, the Special Adviser to the Lagos State Governor on Health. In a WhatsApp chat with DUBAWA, Dr Badmus noted that while tiger nut drinks were implicated in some of the infected persons, they were not definitively stated as the sole cause of the outbreak. She emphasised that correlation does not necessarily imply causation and that the primary transmission route of cholera is through contaminated water or food. Theres an urgent need to identify where water and sewage are interfacing in order to curtail this outbreak, she said. Dr Badmus also pointed out that the outbreak was not confined to one area. Cases were reported in Lagos Island, Eti-Osa, and Kosofe, suggesting multiple sources of contamination. This broader context indicates that the cholera outbreak is not solely linked to tiger nut drinks but may involve various contaminated sources. Also speaking to DUBAWA, Dr Yahya Disu, Head of Corporate Communication, Risk Communication and Community Engagement at NCDC, reacted to the claim: This is not true. With flooding, many water sources are contaminated. You cannot know which water sources are used for drinks, which are mostly sold on the streets. It is not only tiger nuts and zobo that fall into this category. It is better for one to take general precautions when consuming drinks sold in the streets, whose source you are not sure of. Expanding on this, Dr Polycarp Salam, US-CDC CSM Project Implementation Officer at AFENET, highlighted the importance of hygiene in preparing tiger nut drinks. He told DUBAWA that identifying tiger nut drinks as a common factor in cholera cases is likely due to contaminated water rather than the tiger nut itself. He maintained that tiger nut drinks prepared with clean, safe water in a hygienic environment are safe and healthy to consume. Dr Salam pointed out that this principle applies to other local or homemade drinks like zobo, which can be safe for consumption if prepared with boiled or treated water and clean equipment. While tiger nut drinks have been identified as a common factor in some cholera cases, they are not definitively the major cause of the outbreak of cholera in Nigeria. Furthermore, the claim of over a hundred deaths is false, with only 53 deaths recorded in the country so far. Although the health benefits of tiger nuts are well-documented, they should be prepared with clean water and in hygienic environments to guard against contamination.

"Claim: Dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours. It acts as a potent anti-inflammatory, immunity booster, and antioxidant. Verdict: Misleading. There is ongoing research on the potency of dandelion root as a cancer-fighting substance, but no published clinical research has proven an anti-cancer effect in humans. Dandelions are weeds from the Taraxacum family. They have yellow flowers and grow worldwide, including in many peoples lawns. Dandelion leaves, roots, and flowers may offer health benefits. Although often dismissed as a stubborn lawn weed, people have used dandelion in forms of traditional medicine for centuries. Different components of the plants are often found in herbal teas and supplements and act as a natural remedy to support blood sugar management and boost skin, liver, and heart health. Herbal Home on Facebook shared how dandelion root can kill 98% of cancer cells within 48 hours. It is also characterised as a powerful anti-inflammatory, immunity booster, antioxidant, and organ detoxifier. However, one of the most intriguing aspects of the post is the claim that dandelion extract can potentially prevent the growth of cancerous cells in various organ systems. The post has garnered 114 likes and 1400 shares since this report was filed. The virality and potential to be misused by the public is why DUBAWA decided to verify it. According to research done by Healthline , dandelion is considered safe for most people. However, some people may be allergic to touching or ingesting it. Dandelion has also been found to interact with certain medications, including diuretics, lithium, and Cipro, and may not be advisable for some people. However, a four-week study in rats showed that administering dandelion root extract modified specific pathways involved in suppressing the growth and spread of breast cancer cells. Other test-tube studies have found that dandelion root extract may slow the growth of cancer cells in liver, colon, prostate, and stomach tissue. While these studies are encouraging, research in humans is still lacking. Dandelion may have antimicrobial and antiviral properties, supporting your bodys ability to fight infection. However, it isnt entirely risk-free. Doctors advise consultations on any prescription medications before drinking dandelion tea. Martin Ledwick, UKs Cancer information nurse, told Full Fact , There is no scientific evidence that dandelion extract is a useful cancer treatment in humans. Any potential new treatment must undergo rigorous trials in humans before its safety and effectiveness, if any, can be established. We strongly advise anyone considering taking any supplement or unproven treatment to discuss this with their doctor first. Abiola Ayanbukola, a medical doctor at Abuad Teaching Hospital, noted that the dandelion plants could not be dismissed as unsuitable as they contain some particles that can help the body system. Still, no plant can cure 98% of cancer cells yet. We do not recommend plants or roots to patients, especially cancer patients. It has not been proven for the treatment of any type of cancer. The plants can be good for other functions like improving immunity, but these are preventive mechanisms, she said. She further advised patients to visit their doctors on drug prescriptions as roots and herbs taken excessively might affect their health. No research shows that the dandelion plant has been proven to have an anti-cancer effect in humans. Medical experts advise patients to visit their doctor on root and herb intake.",0
"CLAIM : An X user, @TENIBEGILOJU202, shared a claim attributed to Adams Oshiomhole, the senator representing Edo North.Multiple Facbook page have also shared this claim as seen here , here , here and here . The claim reads, BREAKING!!! FOR DEMOCRACY TO THRIVE, PDP AND LP MUST ACCEPT THE PAIN OF RIGGING OSHIOMOLE. At this point, we must do everything possible to ensure that the APC leaves the building or else we are doomed forever. The X user also included a video from Channels TV of Oshiomhole speaking at a press conference. FINDINGS: The video from Channels TV is captioned: Osun governorship election. The election took place in September 2018. So it has nothing to do with the Edo State governorship election. We also found out that the video was originally posted online on 28 September 2018. Then it was captioned: Osun governorship election: Oshiomhole denies allegation of rigging by APC. Oshimhole was reacting to allegations by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the governorship election in Osun was rigged. He said that on the part of the PDP if they win an election, it will mean that the election was free and fair. But if they lose It means the election was rigged. At no point in the video did Oshimhole say the following: At this juncture, we must do everything possible to ensure that APC exit the building or else we are doomed forever. VERDICT: MISLEADING SOURCE: Channels TV",1
"Claim: All 11 counties have been licked (won) by President George Weah is a claim being made by the official campaign spokesperson of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), Cllr. Kanio Bai Gbala Verdict: Misleading. President Weah did not win 11 counties, according to NEC official results. Following the casting of ballots on Tuesday, Oct. 10, 2023, the official spokesperson of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) , Counselor Kanio Bai Gbala, posted on Facebook that the ruling CDC has won all 11 counties. Cllr. Bai Gbala said , All 11 counties have been licked (won). I shall be bringing you percentages shortly, he said. Cllr. Gbala named the 11 counties as Montserrado, Bassa, Bong, Maryland, Sinoe, Grand Kru, Grand Gedeh, River Gee, Grand Cape Mount, Rivercess and Margibi counties. Mr Gballa appears to have deleted the post on Facebook even though the screenshot of his post has gone viral. In verifying this claim, DUBAWA had to subject the election data for each of the counties cited by Bai Gbala to critical scrutiny. The post has already generated mixed reactions on social media, with some comments affirming or denying the assertion. It is important to note that when Bai Gbala shared the post, which had become viral, the National Elections Commission (NEC) is yet to announce the full results of the just-ended polls. DUBAWA visited the official website of the NEC to ascertain the data. According to the NEC website , of the total of 5,890 polling places across the country, the NEC has tallied 5,888 polling places, representing 99.97%. Of this amount, incumbent George Weah is in the lead with 803,956 votes, constituting 43.84%, ahead of the main opposition Unity Party of former Vice President Joseph Boaka with 796,513, amounting to 43.43%. To further ascertain the facts of the assertion made by the CDC spokesperson, DUBAWA looked at each of the counties he mentioned. As per Montserrado County , the main opposition Unity Party of Joseph Boakai obtained 322,166 votes, constituting 46.49% ahead of incumbent President George Weah with 319,366, equivalent to 46.08% The researcher then moved to the next county mentioned, Margibi County . In Margibi County, the opposition Unity Party defeated incumbent president George Weah again. The opposition Unity Party received 63,431 votes, representing 47.08%, while incumbent president George Weah received 56,272, 41.76%. Based on research and the data on the official website of the National Elections Commission, the claim made by the official spokesperson of the ruling CDC that the party won 11 counties, including Montserrado and Margibi Counties, is misleading.",1
"Nigerias president Bola Tinubu is giving away N69,200 (about US$89, at July 2023 exchange rates) to citizens through an empowerment scheme. This is according to a message circulating on WhatsApp and Facebook in the country. Tinubu was sworn in on 29 May 2023, taking over from Muhammadu Buhari. The message asks would-be recipients to call Mr Hamza on the phone number provided. It can also be found on Facebook here . But is Tinubu giving money away in this unorthodox way? Although Tinubu has talked about his plans to empower young people and entrepreneurs, Africa Check could find no evidence that he has set up such an empowerment fund. Instead, we found several other social media posts using this pattern and impersonating several politicians, including Peter Obi , Atiku Abubakar and Tinubu. The three politicians ran against each other in the 2023 presidential election. Several posts on Facebook by Nigerians mocking the scammers' attempts say they received a similar message. One Facebook user warned Nigerians not to fall for such a scam. Another user called the sender semi-illiterate. We also found no mention of such giveaways on the presidents official communication channels or on his social media accounts.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message urges Nigerians to take part in free Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) company registration online with benefits attached. The claim that the Federal Government is doing free online CAC company registration with benefits is false and misleading. Mischievous elements have continued to prey on citizens desires for freebies deceiving them that the CAC is giving out catchy and mouth-watering benefits to lure people to click a link to enable them to enjoy such freebies. A viral WhatsApp message urges Nigerians to apply for the free CAC registration online with the benefits of 50,000 and others attached. When Dubawa accessed the link, the logo on the page was similar to the logo on the page of the CAC but it was noticed that the logo is faint in colouration while the one on the original website is bold. See below the picture of the Logo Upon clicking on an icon, the page directed to another where bio data and name of company to be registered was displayed The next page returns the message, congratulations your CAC certificate will be ready shortly. The next stage on the application has pictures of beneficiaries without any information on how to contact them to assert if the claim of their benefit was genuine. After this comes the last page which reads cac-registration.get-fundz.xyzsays..Thank you for your comment. It will be posted after review. This is the last message that appear, then applicants are asked to share to different groups they belong. Dubawa checked the official website of CAC, disclaimer page and the commissions social media handles to see if it was posted on the page but it was not there. Dubawa also made a call to the customer care service of CAC to inquire about the claim; the respondent said it was false. Furthermore, Dubawa used the google search to see if media platforms published information on the freebies but no such report was found. The claim that the Federal Government is doing free online CAC company registration with benefits is false and misleading.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message gave a breakdown of the new teachers salary structure approved by President Muhammadu Buhari, comparing it with that of the police. Misleading. While it is true that a new salary structure was approved by the president, details of this structure are still unknown as the process is still underway. As the world celebrated Teachers Day on October 5, 2020, Nigeria marked this years Teachers Day with the approval of a new salary structure and service/retirement year for teachers. Alongside other beneficial announcements, President Buhari approved a special salary scale for teachers. This move, the government believes, would motivate Nigerian teachers to do better. Following the announcement, a viral WhatsApp message claims that President Buhari approved this new salary structure to equal that of the police. New Teachers Salary Structure Gl 07= Assistant Education Officer (AEO) N198,000 Gl 08= Education Officer (EO) N254,000 Gl 09= Senior Education Officer (SEO) II N271,000 Gl 10= Senior Education Officer (SEO) I N296,000 Gl 12= Principal Education Officer (PEO) N321,000 Gl 13= Assistant Chief Education Officer (PEO) N342,000 Gl 14= Chief Education Officer (CEO) N419,000 Gl 15= Assistant Director Education (ADE) N483,000 Gl 16= Deputy Director Education (DDE) N531,000 Gl 17= Director Education (DE) N1.5million. Excerpt of viral WhatsApp message on the new salary structure. A keyword search produced news reports on the approval of a new salary scale for teachers. A report by Daily Trust published on October 6, 2020, noted that the president had approved a new salary scale for teachers while increasing their retirement age to 65 with immediate effect. According to the report, this was made known by the minister of education who represented the president at the 2020 World Teachers Day celebration. Similarly, a report by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) pidgin on October 5, 2020, also noted that as part of World Teachers Day, the president has given approval for special salary for teachers and increased the number of their year of service. Another report by t he Guardian published on October 7,2020, described this new salary structure as Teachers Special Salary (TSS). It also noted that this new special salary is unclear and the Federal Government may face tough funding options when it is ready to implement the new policy. Recently on Monday, October 26, 2020, the Punch newspaper published an editorial warning of an impending crisis which the new salary scale might foment. The editorial described this new salary scale as an ill-advised move that should be nipped in the bud. This editorial brought to light the fact that education is on the Concurrent Legislative List of the 1999 Constitution, which requires multi-stakeholder buy-in and wide consultation among the three tiers of government but noted this was ignored by the Federal Government. Dubawa also contacted the spokesperson for the Ministry of Education, Ben Goong, who inferred that there is no breakdown of the new structure as the process is still underway while awaiting committees to work on details of the policy. There is quite a lot of work to be done, not just the figures, the naira and kobo of salary. What confirmation do you expect from me when I said there is a committee that has not even been inaugurated yet so work on that, he said. While it is true that the president approved a new salary structure for teachers, details of this new structure, or a breakdown of this salary structure, has not been released. This makes the viral WhatsApp message misleading.",0
"With its immense popularity among the global youth, TikTok has evolved from a hub for dance routines and lip-syncing videos to a significant source of information. Interestingly, even media outlets have embraced the platform to engage younger audiences through creative content. However, TikToks accessibility and reach have also made it a target for misinformation, with malicious actors luring unsuspecting users through manipulated videos and sensational headlines. Research reports published in 2022 and 2024 revealed that the platforms algorithm had sometimes recommended misleading content to users. Below are a few instances from 2024 where TikTok became entangled in the web of misinformation. A TikTok user shared a video claiming that United States President Joe Biden had made a statement about the Dangote Refinery. According to the video, Mr Biden allegedly urged Aliko Dangote to set petrol pump prices in Nigeria at N150 to alleviate the economic burden on citizens. However, a fact-check by DUBAWA revealed that the video had been manipulated. Furthermore, such a significant remark from a prominent figure like Mr Biden would have been reported by credible news outlets, yet no such report existed, further confirming the claims falsehood. Read more . In August, the #EndBadGovernance protests swept across several cities in Nigeria. Four days into the demonstrations, videos surfaced on social media, showing Nigerians in the northern part of the country carrying Russian flags. An investigation by DUBAWA uncovered that a TikTok influencer with over 100,000 followers was behind the spread of this false information. The influencer used misleading hashtags such as #Zangazanga (a Hausa word for protest), #Putin, and #Rusiya (a Hausa word for Russia) to call for Russias intervention, further fueling the misinformation. Read the investigative piece here . In April 2024, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that scientists from Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) had predicted a potential eruption after detecting about 200 small earthquakes per hour beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, far off Vancouver Island. Following this, a video on TikTok showed collapsed towers and trembling buildings, allegedly linked to the earthquake in Canada. However, a fact-check by DUBAWA revealed that the clips used in the video were unrelated and had been taken from various past events, either in Canada or other countries, debunking the claims authenticity. See more information here . In 2023, Emdee Tiamiyu, a Nigerian YouTuber, gave an interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), during which he made controversial claims that reportedly impacted Nigerian immigrants in the United Kingdom. Earlier this year, a claim circulated on social media alleging that Mr Tiamiyu had been arrested and deported to Nigeria due to his involvement in criminal activities. While the specifics of the alleged crime were unclear, a Liberian YouTuber claimed that Mr Tiamiyu had been arrested by the UK government for defrauding 160,000 in asylum support to build a house in Ogun state. However, DUBAWAs investigation found the claim to be misleading. The picture of the house shared as evidence was sourced from an entirely different context, further discrediting the narrative. Read more here . In 2024, one instance of misinformation on TikTok involved a user, @Be_wise0, sharing what appeared to be screenshots of reports from the popular Nigerian news website, Punch, on the Biafra agitation. The headlines in the screenshots read: Reps ask Nnamdi Kanu to drop Biafra agitation, but join politics for Igbo president and Presidency speaks on Biafra: We cant give out South-South; if the 5 South-Eastern states want to go, they are free. These posts gained traction, drawing attention from users, some of whom supported the claims. However, our findings revealed that the screenshots were manipulated versions of an original Punch report, altering the headlines to create false narratives about Biafra agitation.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp post calls for applications from interested citizens to conduct the June 24, 2023, multi-tier polls. The message is alleged to emanate from the Electoral Commission of Sierra Leone. Verdict: DUBAWA has subjected the notice to verification and discovered that the release is false. The link provided in the post is also fake. A notice of application went viral on social media, particularly on WhatsApp groups, between Thursday, 31 May, and Friday, 1 June 2023. The notice called for applications from the interested public to apply for the various positions at the Electoral Commission of Sierra Leone (ECSL) via a link provided. The link, https://ec.gov.sl.programagency.info/ , appeared to have emanated from the countrys electoral body and sought applications from interested persons to work for ECSL in the forthcoming elections. The notice, in part, reads: ELECTORAL COMMISSION FOR SIERRA LEONE 2023 AD HOC STAFF RECRUITMENT The Electoral Commission For Sierra Leone is recruiting ad hoc staff for the coming general elections. Interested Applicants should click the link below to apply now. Apply Here: https://ec.gov.sl.programagency.info/ . The notice has generated much interest from the public, mostly young graduates who are job hunting. But is this application genuine? DUBAWA decided to investigate the authenticity of the notice. The very first point of interest for DUBAWA was to go to the official website and official Facebook page of ECSL on Friday, 1 June 2023 but found nothing in connection with the purported job application notice, which had gone viral on various WhatsApp pages. DUBAWA then decided to follow the link to ascertain the notices authenticity. DUBAWA finds as follows after clicking on the link: DUBAWA has provided the screenshots grid below to put imagery to the findings upon clicking the click bait link. Just when DUBAWA concluded its internal investigation, a counter-release from The Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL) was issued denouncing the content of the earlier job application notice evidenced below: The ECSL vehemently dissociated itself from the claim, noting that citizens must be aware of the type of websites they follow. The notice from the ECSL disclosed that if anyone wants to apply to work for ECSL during the forthcoming elections, that person must visit the correct website of ECSL which is given as: https://ecslonlinejob.ec.gov.sl . To equally ascertain whether the counter mail did come from ECSL, DUBAWA decided to contact Christopher Jones a member of the ECSL Communications and Public Outreach team, on Friday, 1 June 2023, via his WhatsApp line. He affirmed that the initial notice is fake, adding that the citizenry should ignore it and follow the link provided in the counter-notice. Based on DUBAWAs findings, it is clear that the viral notice of job opportunities claiming to have come from ECSL is false!",0
"Claim: a viral video making rounds on social media claims that soldiers have arrested and flogged Fulani herdsmen kidnappers along the Ife-Ibadan road. The claim that soldiers have arrested and flogged Fulani herdsmen kidnappers along the Ife-Ibadan road is misleading. The event actually took place back in 2019 and happened at Shinkafi local government area of Zamfara State and not along the Ife-Ibadan road. Insecurity in Nigeria has become a major discourse in both the public sphere and media circle. Since 2009, security has not only taken a considerable part of the nations financial budget but has also taken a chunk of newspaper headlines. This reality has, however, placed security matters in the spotlight, alluring massive traction anytime anything related to security is shared. A good example is a video circulating on social media which claims that soldiers have arrested Fulani herdsmen kidnappers along the Ife-Ibadan road. Not only that, the video depicted men in Nigerian military gear engrossed with the flogging of some shirtless persons whom the video alleged to be suspected Fulani herdsmen kidnappers arrested by soldiers of the Nigerian army. The video is collaged alongside a narrative that states, Fulani herdsmen arrested by soldiers along Ife-Ibadan road. The soldiers posed as passengers in a commercial vehicle from where they caught them in their operation. They left their cattle in the bush. Nemesis will still catch up with many more of them. The claim has appeared on YouTube, January, 21st 2021, and attracted more than 1000 views; with comments that neither showed doubts nor skepticism towards the story the video has depicted. The video has also been forwarded multiple times on WhatsApp across different groups and forums and though it did not offer a specific time period as to when the event actually took place, its recent appearance on the social media space appears to pose it as a fresh occurrence. The sensitivity of security matters and information has been a considerable causal factor of unrest in society, especially when it is presented in a visual format, such as the claim at hand. Even more, the claim may also have lethal implications, considering the ongoing debate regarding the presence of herdsmen in the southern part of Nigeria and the recent reports of herdsmen attacks in Osun. Summatively, this may end up crumbling the fragile security structure of those areas. Sequel to this circumstance, DUBAWA opted to establish the fact about this claim, especially to determine when and where it actually took place. Before anything else, DUBAWA traced another version of the video with a slightly different narrative that was shared on YouTube on 26th June 2019. The chronicle attached to this version outlines: Little can be said about the menace caused by herdsmen in the country for a while in the country. These herdsmen were cautioned by officers of The Nigerian Armed Forces for grazing on farmlands. Whats your take on this? Yay or nah. While the other narrative professes that the acclaimed herdsmen were captured by the soldiers for kidnapping and gave the story a flair of recency, the other one suggests it was because of grazing on the farmland back in 2019. This apparent contradiction even raises questions around the actual time the incident took place. Nonetheless, DUBAWA uncovered that the incident actually happened in 2019. However, the major distinction is that it happened in Shinkafi Local Government Area (LGA) in Zamfara State and not along the Ife-Ibadan road as the claim purported. Interestingly, it turned out that the Nigerian Air Force spokesman, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, had condemned the action back in 2019 in a statement he released to the press. He clearly stated that The attention of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has been drawn to a video and some pictures circulating on some social media and online platforms showing some military personnel flogging suspected armed bandits at Shinkafi Local Government Area (LGA) in Zamfara State. The NAF has discovered that some of its personnel were part of the joint team stationed at the Galadi Sub-Sector at the time. The NAF wishes to state unequivocally that the troops actions of flogging and physically assaulting the disarmed suspects were totally unacceptable and not in consonance with the Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) guiding the conduct of the operation. The statement of the NAF spokesperson was also widely reported on major media outlets. Further shreds of evidence from the acclaimed video also confirm the incident happened somewhere in the northwest because, at 1:59 timing of the video one of the soldiers said we are not only SHARAN DAJI we are operation 777, regardless. The operation SHARAN DAJI or 777 is a unit of the Nigerian army that was set up in 2015 to respond to the crises of banditry, cattle rustling, and kidnapping in the northwestern part of Nigeria with a primary focus on Zamfara. Tolu Ogunlesi, the Special Assistant to President Buhari on Digital and New Media, had in 2019, around the time of the incident confirmed that the SHARAN DAJI is primarily stationed in the northwest. This implies that the incident did not happen along the Ife-Ibadan road as claimed, because the particular army unit is not functional and stationed there. Although the acclaimed incident actually took place, the real narrative regarding where and when it took place was slanted to forge a rather misleading story around the video. Thus this claim is misleading because the event happened in Shinkafi, Zamfara State, and not along the Ife-Ibadan road.",0
"In October 2024, a former chair of Nigeria's electoral commission, Prof Humphrey Nwosu, died . Nwosu chaired the National Electoral Commission (NEC), now known as the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec), from 1989 to 1993 and presided over the historic annulled election of 12 June 1993. But some messages circulating on Facebook in Nigeria claim that the current Inec chairperson, Prof Mahmood Yakubu , has also died after a brief illness. Yakubu is serving his second term . He was first appointed by former president Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 and reappointed for a second term in 2020. One of the Facebook begins : Breaking News: INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu, Passes Away in London After Brief Illness. Reports indicate that he went to bed in good health but woke up experiencing a severe medical emergency. Despite efforts by his family to provide the best care by transferring him to London for treatment, he was pronounced dead, it adds. The same claim appeared on Facebook here and here . ( Note: See other instances of the claim at the end of this report. ) But is the chair of Nigeria's electoral agency dead? We checked. Inec chairperson is alive As a well-known figure, Yakubu's death would have been widely reported by trustworthy local and international media. The absence of any credible news reports suggests that this is a death hoax. Rotimi Oyekanmi, spokesperson for Inec, told Africa Check that Yakubu was well. The Inec chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, is alive, hale and hearty, Oyekanmi said. We also found a video of a TV interview in which Yakubu commented on Ghana's elections on 7 December 2024. Death hoaxes targeting public figures are a form of misinformation. They exploit public attention and can cause confusion. The false claim also appeared here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"Claim: A call for massive recruitment atSokoto State University Viral post making the rounds on WhatsApp seeking interested and qualified candidates for recruitment into Sokoto State University is FALSE. A call for massive recruitment at the Sokoto State University has recently been going round on social media especially the WhatsApp platform, with a directive to share widely for qualified Nigerians to take advantage of the job openings. The message stated that the university wishes to engage suitably qualified scholars and academics to fill numerous academic and non-academic positions, which includes: Senior Lecturer, Professor, Graduate Assistant, Lecturer 1, Lecturer II Reader, Counseling Psychologist, Higher Pharmacy Technician, Medical Officer, Graduate Nursing Officer, Principal Library Officer amongst others, with October 18, 2021 deadline. Screenshot of the WhatsApp message about Sokoto State University Sokoto State is one of the 36 States of Nigeria, located in the extreme northwest of the country on the national border with the Republic of Niger. Arising from the insatiable quest of the people of the state for education and excellence, the idea of establishing the Sokoto State University was conceived by the then Sokoto State Governor Aliyu Wamakko when he established the Sokoto State University Implementation Committee in 2008. The committee was charged with the responsibility of: Planning for the structure and facilities for the effective running of the university, seeking for and obtaining approval from the Federal Government for Sokoto state to run its own university aside, Usmanu Danfodiyo University, which is Federal Government owned and in which the indigenes of the state were marginally placed over the years arising from the Federal Character Principle; and establishing the Sokoto State University School of Developmental Studies with the sole aim of preparing students, a one-year pre-degree programme before enrolling into the University. The approval was granted in 2009. Dubawa began its verification by visiting the website attached to the viral message. Screenshot of the call for application on the website The site contains numerous calls for recruitments for academic and non- academic positions in different universities in Nigeria including that of the Sokoto State University. The website described itself as a job, vacancy, career opportunity blog, which shares daily updates on available vacancies, local and international scholarships, government and international organization loans and grants. Talking about the advertised job, the site states that the salaries and conditions of service are as applicable to the post appointed for in Nigerian Universities as approved by Sokoto State Government and the Governing Council of the university from time to time. It also urged interested and qualified candidates to submit their applications and up-to-date curriculum vitae to include contact mobile phone numbers and email addresses through the universitys email: info@ssu.edu.ng or by Courier to: The Registrar, Sokoto State University, P.M. 2134, Birnin Kebbi Road, Sokoto, Sokoto State. screenshot of application instruction The website added a caveat that said it is not an agent of any organizations, and cannot assist any applicant to secure a job, loan, grant, or scholarship, as they only share the information for interested persons to apply. Further search on the website of Sokoto State University revealed there was no opening for job offers but it contains a disclaimer dated August 18, 2021 and signed by the institutions Registrar, Amins Yusuf Garba, to a false advertisement being circulated online, soliciting applications for a purported recruitment exercise. The university in the disclaimer notified the general public that the university is not recruiting for any position, either directly or through any proxy, as it warned the general public to be cautious and vigilant to avoid falling victim to the plots of unscrupulous elements who are circulating the false recruitment notices, to deceive unsuspecting applicants. In view of the above, the university is hereby advising the general public to always seek accurate and credible information by visiting its website @ www.ssu.edu.ng, its verified social media handles on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube or by visiting the Institution, the disclaimer added.

"Claim: A Facebook user named Aguleri Culture & Music, Add Your Passion posted a video on August 1, 2024, alleging that a part of former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, was set ablaze. Verdict: While there are reports that protesters surrounded Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, there is no concrete evidence that the house was burnt. Nigerians took to the streets across the country under the #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria movement, protesting against widespread corruption, poor governance, and the rising cost of living, which has left millions struggling to afford necessities. The protests, which began on August 1 and continued until August 10, saw demonstrators gather in various regions, including Kano, Katsina, and Yobe. In some of these areas, authorities imposed curfews in response to the violence that erupted, including the burning of vehicles and the destruction of property. Amid the unrest, numerous claims circulated on social media, including a video posted by the Facebook user Aguleri Culture & Music, Add Your Passion . The video was shared with a caption which claimed that a part of former President Muhammadu Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, was burnt during the protests. The caption reads: A part of Buharis house in Daura is on fire, organised protest, set Buhari legacy on fire The video showed thick flames rising into the air while people gathered to watch as the fire intensified. Despite gaining attention, the video lacked comments and had around 100 views at the time of this report. Preliminary checks by DUBAWA revealed that the same video was later posted on X by user Nkirukamma (@SabinaNkiru) on August 10, 2024. The caption accompanying the post read: UNCONFIRMED! Buharis house is said to have been set ablaze in Daura, Katsina State. If this is true, then the North is no longer as we know it. The post attracted over 121,000 views, 124 reposts, and 16 replies. Some social media users sceptically questioned the claim. For instance, Anioma Ronu (@ChiduObodo) commented , The other time it was Tinubus house, now its Buharis house. Why are you so madly in love with fake news like this? Another user, Okechukwu Anozie (@elgedox), questioned the authenticity of the claim, asking , Pls, is this true? DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on several keyframes from the video and confirmed that the footage was indeed taken in Katsina State during the protest. The video went viral on the day of the protest. However, further investigation revealed that while several reputable media organisations, including Punch Newspapers and Channels TV , reported that protesters had invaded Buharis house in Daura, no reports indicated that any part of the house was set ablaze. According to Channels TV , the protesters barricaded major roads leading to Maiadua-Kwangwalam and Daura, including the T-junction leading to Buharis residence. The station also noted that the protesting youths eventually submitted a grievance letter to one of the former presidents aides for delivery to Buhari. Additionally, the report revealed a heavy security presence around the former presidents house during the protest, and the Katsina State Government imposed a curfew across all 34 Local Government Areas to maintain law and order. Despite the widespread discussions online, no credible sources or authorities have confirmed the claim that Buharis house was set on fire. While it is true that protesters gathered near the residence, reports of the home being burnt remain unverified.

"If you are an active X user in Nigeria, you are likely aware of the ongoing campaign against body odour and the increasing call for people to use deodorants and antiperspirants. This conversation came up again because of the Ojude Oba festival. The Ojude Oba festival, an annual festival held in Ogun State, received national attention. It trended on social media platforms for weeks for its beauty, historical dances, and horse displays. Controversial journalist Kemi Olunloyo, in her X post, noted that most women during the Ojude Festival had a foul smell because the body fragrances used had mixed with sweat smell, providing an offensive odour. She explained that when crowds are gathered in a place wearing thick materials like the Yoruba aso oke, they are advised to wear body spray containing antiperspirants and deodorants. Antiperspirants prevent sweating, while deodorants stop the odour, she wrote. Different reactions followed the post. Some disagreed with what she had written. Others sought clarity on the differences and when to use each product. Deodorants and antiperspirants reduce body odour in different ways. Some people prefer deodorants over concern about aluminium compounds in antiperspirants, though research suggests this is not a cause for concern. Antiperspirants and deodorants work in different ways to reduce body odour. Antiperspirants reduce sweat, while deodorants increase the skins acidity. Healthline states deodorants are formulated to eliminate armpit odour but not perspiration. They are typically alcohol-based. When applied, they turn skin acidic, making it less attractive to bacteria. Deodorants offer two forms of protection against odour. The first is antimicrobial properties that reduce the number of bacteria that produce odour. The second is a fragrance that masks the odour. The active ingredients in antiperspirants usually include aluminium-based compounds that temporarily block sweat pores. Blocking sweat pores reduces the amount of perspiration that reaches your skin. Antiperspirants may benefit from acting as a deodorant because of how the product works. When antiperspirants block sweat glands, they also block odours from escaping, which reduces how badly you smell when sweating. If over-the-counter (OTC) antiperspirants cannot control your sweating, prescription antiperspirants are available. Deodorant masks odour, while an antiperspirant reduces how much you sweat. Both products work wherever applied to your body, most commonly on the underarms. Many times, deodorant and antiperspirant are combined into a single product. Two primary reasons to use deodorants and antiperspirants are moisture and smell. Sweat is a cooling mechanism that helps us shed excess heat. Armpits have a higher density of sweat glands than other body areas. Some people wish to reduce their sweating since armpit sweat can sometimes soak through clothing. Sweat can also contribute to body odour. Your sweat itself does not have a strong odour. The bacteria on your skin breaking down sweat produce an odour. The damp warmth of your armpits is an ideal environment for bacteria. The sweat from your apocrine glands, located in the armpits, groin, and nipple area, is high in protein, which makes it easy for bacteria to break down. Antiperspirants and deodorants work in different ways to reduce body odour. Antiperspirants reduce sweat, and deodorants increase skin acidity, which odour-causing bacteria do not like. While there are rumours linking antiperspirants to cancer, research suggests that it does not cause cancer. However, studies also recommend further research to study its potential link with the disease. Body sprays are similar to perfumes, containing fragrance extracts such as herbs, oils, and spices mixed with alcohol and water. They help people smell great, giving them a fresh scent that lasts for a few hours. However, they dont stop sweating. In effect, they only mask body odours rather than stopping them. Body sprays have the short-term effect of covering up body odours, whereas antiperspirant deodorants are formulated to address their root cause. Sweat itself doesnt smell. But when it mixes with the bacteria on your skin, it can cause body odour. Anti-perspirant deodorants combat body odour in two ways: first, they cover the sweat glands that release sweat onto your skin, stopping the sweat and bacteria from mixing. Second, they reduce the amount of bacteria on your skin in the first place. Purple.com explains that people in sports or physically strenuous activities prefer deodorants over body spray. This is because constant sweating encourages the growth of odour, which causes bacteria. They wrote, A deodorant doubles as a clinical agent and has antimicrobial properties, which helps it reduce bacterial growth. Deodorants can cover body odour, but body sprays can not cover it. Deodorants also help against sweat odour. Antiperspirants effectively reduce sweat and, in turn, body odour, making them ideal for those who struggle with excessive sweating. On the other hand, deodorants focus on neutralising odour by targeting bacteria and providing a pleasant fragrance.",1
"Claim: Nigerias heat wave has never reached 40C before. Verdict: FALSE. Reliable records show that the temperature in Nigeria at various times had reached and surpassed 40c. A heat wave, also known as extreme heat, is a period of abnormally hot weather. It occurs when the temperature in plains reaches 40C or more and in hilly regions 30C or more. The happenings around climate change recently took a severe dimension, with unbearable heat levels recorded globally. Africa, like other continents, has had its share of this heat and, in many cases, still does. For instance, South Sudan recently ordered the closure of schools because of an expected heat wave that is forecast to last about two weeks. An X user, Africa Facts Zone (@AfricaFactsZone), shared the news , generating over 300,000 engagements, including views, likes, comments, and reposts. Reacting to this news, an X user, OlaMide (@Fifa737), commented that heat in Nigeria has never reached 40 degrees. However, a user, CH EL ~ HAJI OF BUK (@agab_friyoyo), disagreed, stating, You havent been to core north. Kano usually frequents 43, 44, and 45. Another user, Septemberkid (@petressanchez), wrote, Nigeria has never reached 45 true. Theres a difference between temperature and feel-like temperature. These conflicting comments and the need to set the records straight prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. We checked the Nigerian Meteorological Agency ( NiMet ) and found that the institute had published forecasts showing temperatures above 40 degrees on different dates in many locations in Nigeria. You can see the estimates here , here , here , and here . Al Jazeera and AIT also reported some of these forecasts. The claim by an X user that the temperature in Nigeria has never reached 40C is false, as available data show otherwise.",0
"Claim: A Twitter blog claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) asked women in Anambra to avoid using make-up on November 6, when the states gubernatorial election will be held. INEC had asked women to avoid using makeovers on the election day for proper identification. As the Anambra elections scheduled for November 6 draws near, several information have been circulating regarding the readiness of INEC to ensure a successful election. Aside from the fears expressed over the safety of voters due to the rate of insecurity in the region, INEC said the body had successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the election including the provision of non-sensitive materials for the governorship election. A Twitter blog, Naija PR on 17th of October made a post on its Twitter handle explaining that INEC had informed Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day. The post reads: INEC has told Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day. The post, which had garnered over 700 retweets, was greeted with doubts from some people who expressed reservations about the accuracy of the report. Despite this, so many other Twitter users and pages shared the same information on their timelines with the same piece of information. Other news outlets also reported the news as seen here , here and here . Findings by Dubawa showed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) indeed asked women coming to cast their votes during the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election to avoid using make-up on the election day. In a report on several credible news platformsas seen here and here , the INEC State Deputy Director, Gender Desk, Chika Osuji, gave the directive on October 17 in Awka. Osuji had attributed the development to the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) that the agency would deploy to capture voters faces during the poll. Osuji had said The BVAS will be used during the Anambra gubernatorial election to enable voters to use their fingerprints during accreditation at the polling units. I know many women may not be able to engage makeup artists due to restriction of movements; but for those who cant do without makeups, we appeal to you to minimise the level of the painting. If we cant read your fingerprints we can read your face, and if we cannot read your face, you are not a registered voter, and we will not allow you to participate. Explaining the BVAS, Barrister Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee said the system uses fingerprints or facials for efficient voter accreditation. In situations where the fingerprint of the voter fails, the face of the voter will be captured to allow them cast their votes . However, if there are heavy makeovers, the person may not be identified. A civil society organisation which also serves as an election observer during the Isoko South State Assembly Constituency bye-election in Delta State had earlier hailed the initiative , saying the BVAS will reduce human interference in the electoral process. It further described it as a robust and efficient way to guarantee the credibility of the voter accreditation and result management process to promote transparent elections. The claim that INEC advised female voters to avoid using make-up on election day is true. Findings by Dubawa showed that this is due to the BVAS system that will be deployed.",1
"French soldiers have been deployed to Maiduguri in Borno, a northeastern state in Nigeria, to help fight against Boko Haram. This is according to several posts on Facebook. Boko Haram is a terrorist organisation responsible for numerous attacks on civilians, schools and government facilities, as well as kidnappings. These include the widely reported abduction of schoolgirls in Chibok , also in Borno state, in 2014. One post , published 16 December 2024, is headlined: END OF DENIAL: COMMENCEMENT OF FRANCE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA. The post features a video of a soldier speaking to the media in Hausa, the language predominantly spoken in the northern part of Nigeria. A white man in military fatigues and cap stands beside the Hausa-speaking soldier. Part of the post reads: Yesterday, the Chief of Army staff received the first contingent of French soldiers and immediately deployed them to maiduguri to HELP NIGERIA IN FIGHTING BOKO HARAM . The same boko haram they claimed to have decimated and are scamping for safety. During his address on Nigeria's Independence Day on 1 October, president Bola Tinubu said that the government had eliminated Boko Haram and bandit commanders faster than ever, over 300 at last count. Furthermore, in an effort to deepen economic ties with France, Tinubu visited French president Emmanuel Macron in November 2024, sparking rumours on social media. The post questions the genuineness of the president's assertion about eliminating Boko Haram and claims that the Nigerian army chief has received French soldiers to be deployed to Maiduguri. Similar posts can be found here and here . (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But does the video show French soldiers' deployed in Maiduguri? We checked. False claim On 16 December, the Nigerian army denied the claim, saying that no plan was underway to establish a French military base in the northeast. The army explained that the video was from another event on 25 October at which Brig Gen Abubakar Haruna addressed the press alongside a member of the British Military Advisory Training Team . Using keywords from the statement, Africa Check found a longer version of the video on the News Central TV page on YouTube, posted on 27 October. The video features a caption that reads: UK Military Supports Nigeria with Counter-IED Equipment for Counterterrorism. The caption aligns with the armys claim that the video was taken then, during the presentation of counter-improvised explosive device equipment to improve operations in northeastern Nigeria. According to the YouTube video, the white soldier in the video is Col Martin Leach , deputy head of the British defence staff for West Africa. The video does not show French soldiers deployed to Nigeria and is not evidence for this. Similar posts can be found here , here , here and here .",0
"Claim: An email sent to an individual claiming to emanate from Guaranty Trust Bank directed individuals to click a URL and link their registered account phone numbers with their National Identity Number (NIN) failure before December 30, 2020, of which the account will be blocked. Verdict: Misleading: the email did not emanate from Gtbank and the email used in dissemination is not the official email used by GTBank. Since the Federal Government announced the use of NIN to link to phone numbers, there have been several pieces of information circulating online and offline. The government had once asked Nigerians to pay N20 to get their NIN but it later canceled the plan after receiving several knocks from Nigerians. The government also extended the deadline for NIN registration to Dec 30. While communication companies are constantly sending customers text messages to dial some codes to retrieve their NIN directly from their phone, fraudsters have decided to take advantage to defraud ignorant Nigerians. One of such moves is an email sent to Nigerians to link their phone numbers used in opening their accounts with GTB to their NIN. The message reads; Dear customer The Federal Government through the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has directed that each bank customers phone number must be linked to a National Identification Number (NIN). Failure to do this by December 30, 2020 will result in your account being blocked. Dont know your NIN? Simply follow the reference below to verify your NIN. Verify and Link your NIN here now. Thank you for choosing Guaranty Trust Bank plc Dubawa visited one of the GTbanks in Rivers State in the new GRA to verify the email sent to Nigerians. A customer care officer after viewing the email said the email does not emanate from the Gtbank. A closer look at the senders email address shows it does not bear the official email of GTbank official, said one of the customer care officers who prefers anonymity. He said all official emails of any GTBank must end with @gtbank.com. This makes this claim fake and misleading. Further, Gmail identified the email as dangerous, used to steal data. This message seems dangerous. Similar message was used to steal peoples information. Avoid clicking links, downloads, attachment or replying with personal information, Gmail flagged. Another red flag detected is that a bank customer who received the email banks with United Bank of Africa (UBA) and has never had any account with GTbank. Dubawa reached out to a senior officer at the UBA in Port Harcourt, who simply identified himself as Grey, to find out if there are any collaborations with UBA and GTbank on NIN. Grey told Dubawa that fraudsters are at work recently; therefore, the email should be discarded, adding and do not click any link or response to the email. We have no collaboration with GTbank. An email, asking bank customers to link their phone numbers with their NIN is misleading and did not emanate from Gtbank as claimed.

"Claim: A Facebook user, George Udom, claimed that the #EndBadGovernanace protest has been shifted to October 1st with certain conditions. Verdict: False! One of the protest leaders, Omoyele Sowore, dismissed the claim as untrue. Meanwhile, no credible news outlet has reported the purported postponement. Ahead of a nationwide anti-bad government protest scheduled for Aug. 1, 2024, a Facebook user, George Udom , claims the protest has been postponed to Oct. 1, 2024. He stated that the Good Nigerian Movement (GNM) had announced the postponement, which is also based on the government meeting certain conditions demanded by the citizens. The conditions include temporary removal of import duties on food, affordable fuel availability, incentives, and security for farmers, among other social amenities. DUBAWA contacted Yele Sowore, one of the leaders of the nationwide protests, via WhatsApp and inquired if the claim was credible. In response, Mr Sowore informed us that the Facebook post is false and should be disregarded. Please ignore the desperate fake announcement in circulation that the #EndBadGovernance revolt has been postponed. It is false, he said. Moreover, no credible news outlet has reported any news of such postponement. Sources linked with the planned protest reveal that the claim is false.",0
"Claim: Martin Kollie alleged on his Facebook page that a supporter of the CDC has been made an Observer for the United Nations (UN) in the countrys presidential run-off elections. Verdict : Misleading! Madam Gradiah Walker Bou Hussein, Associate Development Coordination Officer, Communications and Advocacy at the United Nations Resident Coordinators Office in Liberia, said the UN doesnt deploy observers in elections. Our findings also show that the alleged observer, Amb. Justice Samuel Doe, works for the International Association of World Peace Advocates in the 2023 elections (IAWPA), not the UN. Martin K. N. Kollie, Head of Research and Rapid Response for the opposition Unity Party, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, Nov. 14 said Amb. Justice Samuel Doe is a CDCIAN serving as an observer for the United Nations in the elections. The post generated 301 reactions, 160 comments, and 236 shares during the time of this report. The U.N hired this guy to serve as an observer. This man should not be an observer. He is a diehard partisan of the CDC. He is not independent and neutral, Martin posted. Martins comment puts the credibility of the international partner at stake in the Liberian 2023 Presidential elections. This led DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA first contacted the UN office in Liberia. According to Madam Gradiah Walker Bou Hussein, the Associate Development Coordination Officer, Communications and Advocacy at the United Nations Resident Coordinators Office in the country, who said that the United Nations doesnt deploy observers in elections but witnesses the process. Please note that the United Nations does not have observers. The UN also does not observe elections. We only witness it. Madam Hussein said. In further verification, DUBAWA decided to do online research about Doe. Social media posts on his Facebook page support the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change in the elections. In his posts , Doe can be seen promoting President George Weahs re-election and canvassing for votes for him. Our research also finds that Doe is an observer in the elections under an international organisation based in Nigeria called the International Association of World Peace Advocates ( IAWPA). A look at Does images shows him by the IAWPAs banner. In another photo, he wore IWAPAs branded clothes, as seen below. Meanwhile, our fact-checker also contacted Doe to verify if he was working with the UN for the election, but he has yet to respond. See the message screenshot below Conclusion Based on our findings, Amb. Doe is a supporter of the CDC but not an election observer of the United Nations.",1
"Claim : Most guys are not bald naturally; masturbation makes them bald. Verdict : FALSE. There is no evidence that masturbation in men leads to hair loss or stops hair growth. Baldness in men is a common phenomenon but sometimes becomes a concern when it happens at a much younger age. Sometimes, people who experience hair loss have used medical intervention to redeem it. A former English striker, Wayne Rooney , is an example of a person who has undergone a hair transplant. It was so important to him that, two years after the first transplant failed, he went again at age 27 for a second one . While the cause of Rooneys baldness was known to be male pattern baldness and found to be hereditary, several other reasons exist. However, a tweet asserts that masturbation is why most men are bald. Most guys aint bald naturally, masturbation made them bald, the more you masturbate, the more you lose hair, stop masturbating guys to keep your hairline intact, the tweet reads. The tweet got a combination of retweets, likes, comments and views in 159 engagements. The tweet in the screenshot below came from a user known as @JAY6th. Similar claims were made here and her e, with a combined engagement of over 400. Seeing the belief is widely shared, DUBAWA deemed it necessary to verify the claim. Baldness, according to hopkinsmedicine.org , is a state of hair loss or absence of hair. Its also called alopecia . Baldness is usually most noticeable on the scalp but can happen anywhere on the body where hair grows. The condition is more common in men than in women. Masturbation , on the other hand, is an erotic stimulation, especially of ones genital organs, commonly resulting in orgasm and is achieved by manual or other bodily contacts exclusive of sexual intercourse , by instrumental manipulation, occasionally by sexual fantasies, or by various combinations of these agencies. Looking at both definitions, it is difficult not to wonder where these two phenomena meet. In verifying this, DUBAWA dug into research and publications on the subject. In the video here , Metromale Clinic, which has over 64,000 YouTube subscribers, published a video by a Sexologist, Karthik Gunasekaran , who says masturbation has nothing to do with hair loss. According to Karthik, when a man masturbates, the only thing lost is semen, which has nothing whatsoever with hair loss. He states that the only thing that can cause hair loss is Testosterone , and this is not connected to masturbation. This article published by HairMD in May 2021 revealed that no medical proof was found that masturbation or sexual activities cause hair loss. It further explained that DHT (DiHydroTestosterone), proven to cause baldness, is not produced during masturbation or sexual activity. We also discovered a fact-check by The Cable in August 2022, which rated this claim false . A medical doctor, Frederick Unuigbokhai , in an interview with DUBAWA, stated that there is no medically proven link between masturbation and baldness. He explained that baldness happens in both men and women and that a high level of testosterone can lead to a heightened urge for sex and which could lead to masturbation but does not result in baldness. Click here to learn the possible causes, symptoms, treatments, and other relevant baldness information. Our findings show that there is no medical proof that masturbation causes baldness. The claim that it does is a myth. - The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with the newsroom of Wazobia FM and Nigeria Info FM to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: An image of a Portuguese football player, Cristiano Ronaldo, carved on limestone was shared on the Facebook page of GOAL Africa with the assertion that it was made by a young lad who appeared in the image. Verdict: The claim is false. The image was generated using AI. The Facebook page of Goal Africa , an online website dedicated to football-related activities, posted an image of Portuguese star Christiano Ronaldo, claiming he was carved into a limestone by a young lad, who also appeared in the image. The post garnered 96,000 likes, 2,100 comments and 1,600 shares. Comments under the post showed mixed reactions, as some believed the kid had made the statue while others pointed out it was AI-generated. This is very commendable of him, Henry Akisikpo commented. Akisikpo also encouraged social media users to draw Ronaldos attention to the image so he could help the boy. Who knows if that can change the lads life trajectory, he added. Confused about the origin of the image, Victor Joshua Jnr wondered if the image was generated using AI. He added that the world is crumbling as it is hard to know what is real and what is not. While Ahmad Adam was surprised at the naivety of those who felt the image was real, saying, I dont know why yall are so gullible to realise that this is just an AI-generated image. DUBAWA decided to investigate this claim because it could misinform the public. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search. The results showed that the image was shared on several online platforms, here , here , here , and here . Through the same process, DUBAWA traced the source of the image to a Facebook page that posts AI-generated sculptures of celebrities and world leaders. Though the page did not specifically state that it is dedicated to the production of AI images, a search through the images posted on the page showed the same patterns of sculptures with purported creators, mostly young kids, standing by its side. Also, most of the generated images have the same caption: Amazing Young Boy (Amazing Artwork). The image was also subjected to analysis by AI detection tools. Hive AI showed that the image is 99 % AI-generated, while Is it AI indicated the image has a 90.72 % chance of being AI-generated. The statue of Cristiano Ronaldo was created using AI. A boy did not carve it.

"Elizabeth Ogunbamowo Claim: A viral video resurfaced on Wednesday, 30th June 2021 claiming members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) staged a mass protest against the recent rearrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu. It showed IPOB members displaying their flags and chanting war songs. The viral video is misleading as it is a 2015 video which resurfaced and is being circulated to sell a narrative that IPOB members constituted a nuisance after the arrest causing a lot of gridlock in Port Harcourt. On Tuesday, 29th June 2021, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, announced the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Malami said Kanu was intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian Intelligence and Security Services on Sunday 27th June. He said Kanu had been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial for 11-count charge against him after jumping bail in 2017. Kanu was first arrested in Nigeria on October 14, 2015, following years of his campaign for the sovereign state of Biafra. He was granted bail in April 2017 but fled the country after soldiers invaded his residence in Abia state during a military clampdown on IPOB members. While on the run, the separatist leader piloted the affairs of IPOB from abroad. His rearrest had sparked heated reactions across the countrys political landscape, particularly among those backing activities of IPOB. Not long after Kanus rearrest, social media users started sharing a video of IPOB members protesting on a street in Port Harcourt and causing a lot of unrest linking it to the warning. Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, took to his Facebook page to share the same video with the caption, Marching for Nnamdi! I repeat this man must not die in detention. The post has since gathered over 6,000 likes on the platform with 4,000 shares. He also shared the video on Twitter and it had raked in over 1,900 retweets and 2, 600 likes as of the time of Tuesday, June 6. On Youtube, the video has also been shared by some pages such as an online blog titled Daily Post, a mimicry of the original news medium, Daily Post. This blog, a pass off of Daily Post, also published a story to this effect on its website. Other Youtube Channels on which this video was shared include: Ikeja Online Tv, Biafra Channel TV, Val Obi Channel among many others. Dubawa observed that the video that has gone viral on social media appeared in various lengths. One was 8 minutes 22 seconds long while another appeared in 4 minutes 25 seconds; another version which was shared was 4 minutes, 38 seconds. The video showed protesters who appeared to be members of IPOB in vehicles and on foot en masse on the streets with the Biafran flag. A YouTuber who shared the video on June 30, said in the background, It is happening right now in Igweocha Rivers State, Igweocha is boiling right now, our people brothers and sisters have come out to protest the arrest of our great leader. Zoo government cant silence us, no they cant do that, we cant be discouraged, Biafra is here. We are here. Forty seconds into the video, a man and a lady could be heard in the background shouting. Nna eh (Igbo word meaning Father), e dey happen for Port Harcourt oh, Biafra, Biafra, here we are, O boy see the crowd. This is the state of Biafra at Igweocha. They want to bring down the Nigeian flag, this is Biafran land. Yes, this is Biafra! Biafra, here we are, at Igweocha, declare the state of Biafra. They have removed the Nigerian flag. For Buhari to tamper with Nnamdi Kanu, he is finished. Buhari must obey Biafra. Dubawa also observed an icon at the right-hand corner of the video which represents that of a video editing app, Kine Master. The Youtuber used this video editing app, Kine master to select and edit the videos. Another Youtuber, Val Obi , rotated the same video before posting on his channel. While the original version of the video and other copies of the video showed a red truck on the left-hand side of the recorder, this YouTuber changed the view to the right hand. He claims, There is rioting at the moment in the city of Igweocha Port Harcourt following the arrest and detention of Mazi Kanu. From checks, the video had originated in 2015. One of the YouTube channels, NNTV Africa posted the video as far back as October 31, 2015, in three parts. Part one of the video is what has been copied and recirculated as a recent video. IPOB had earlier in a statement issued on 30th of June had urged its members to remain calm and had only declared that its members will flood Abuja for Kanus trial on July 26 and 27 as stated. The statement issued by the groups spokesman Emma Powerful had read, Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is presently in the custody of the Nigerian Government. This evil crime of kidnapping was masterminded by the Nigerian Government in collaboration with all those that view IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu as a stumbling block against their bid to hold Biafra in perpetual slavery. We, therefore, enjoin every IPOB member both at home and in the Diaspora and all Biafrans to remain calm because this is not the end of the road. Our leaders next court appearance is July 26, 2021, and Biafrans should mobilize and attend the court hearing. This reporter observed the picture quality of the video was not in a very high resolution. With the InVID verification Plugin, the reporter used the analysis tab to get fragments (images) from the video. The reporter further used the available reverse image search engines such as TinEye, Google image reverse search, and Yandex on the fragments produced. While Yandex did not produce any useful results, Google reverse image search showed that the video had been posted several times in the last few days on Facebook, online platforms with most results showing YouTube videos. One of the search results showed the same video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt. TinEye produced about four matches for the video when a keyframe analysis was conducted showing the same videos being uploaded in 2016 and 2019. Using the keyframe tab, InVID also allowed for a video fragmentation, where the reporter selected keyframes and with a right-click, more search engines were made available for reverse image search. With this, the Bing search engine brought up the same result of the video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt. A keyword search on YouTube also led to the video which was posted on October 31, 2015 on NNTV-Africa titled, Biafra Restoration, Nnamdi Kanus Arrest: IPOB Protest in Igweocha (Port Harcourt) Rivers State Part 1 This Fact check concludes that the viral video of protesters carrying the Biafran flag also with leaves chanting war songs is misleading as the video first appeared online in 2015. Therefore, the video could not have been connected to a recent protest against the rearrest of Nnamdi Kanu in the South-South. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with SaharaReporters to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: A news portal Concord Times alleges that ECSL staff allowed people to vote without accreditation. FINDING: While the claim did not categorically impugn wrongdoing on the part of the ECSL staff, there is a subtle suggestion that allowing people without Voter IDs or accreditation to voting was illegal. DUBAWA, therefore, sought to discover the conditions under which voters can vote even without accreditations or Voter IDs. Several education campaigns of ECSL pointed to the fact that individuals without tangible voter ID cards would be allowed to vote if said persons name given can be located in the ECSL voter logs. Additionally, the person has to answer two security questions: What are your mother and fathers full names? If such security questions are answered correctly, and the face of the said individual matches the one on the ECSLs logs, then that person would be allowed to vote without any tangible voter ID. A call to ECSLs Director of Media and Communication, George Jones, confirmed that the above procedure was followed by ECSL officials in New England, and many other centres operated as such. VERDICT: Misleading!",1
"Claim: Ivory Coast loses four points in AFCON over misconduct. Verdict: False. Credible news outlets inform that photos of the Ivorian players in a brawl were taken during training before the World Cup qualifier against Tanzania in 2013. Ahead of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2023, scheduled to commence on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2023, a Facebook user claimed that the host nation, Cte dIvoire, has lost points over pitch misconduct. The Facebook user, Ndifreke Heartbeat, wrote that Cote dIvoire had lost points due to its players involvement in a physical brawl, allegedly placing group mate, Nigeria, at the top spot in the group. Attached to the claim were images of two Ivorian players visibly locked in a fight as players and officials tried to separate them. The claim has generated over 40,000 likes, 2,100 comments and shared 455 times. There were diverse reactions in the comment section. So our pathway to qualification is (through) other people fighting? Simon Onyekachi Igbudu queried . Fake news. Henry Okwudiri dismissed . Due to the controversy generated and the sensitivity of the claim, DUBAWA decided to verify it. We conducted a keyword search related to the claim and found a news report published by Daily Mail . The 2013 news article reports how former Manchester City player Abdul Razak was sent home by the Ivory Coast for fighting with a teammate. The paper further informed that Mr Razak was punished for scrapping with Jean-Jacques Gosso, who played for the Turkish side Mersin dmanyurdu at the time. It was also reported that the incident had happened during a training session ahead of Ivory Coasts clash against Tanzania in the World Cup qualifiers. Notably, along with the publication were photos of the brawl taken by the American visual media company Getty Images. Manchester Evening News and Modern Ghana also reported that Ivory Coast had given Mr Razak a reprieve and sent him home after a face-off with Jean-Jacques Gosso on the training ground. The claim is false. Several news platforms report that the incident happened in 2013.",0
"Claim: An X user @Ne0_officiall asserts that excessive intake of oral contraceptives can cause fibroid growth. Verdict: Insufficient Evidence! There is no sufficient medical research to support this claim. Some studies suggest that oral contraceptives may increase the risk, while some suggest oral contraceptives can also be used to reduce the risk of developing fibroids. Uterine fibroids are a significant public health concern among Nigerian women. Studies show varying prevalence rates across different regions, with a 14.2% prevalence in Ogoni, Rivers State, a 6.83% prevalence in South-West Nigeria, and as high as 48% among celibate women in Ibadan . Research also suggests that fibroids are more common in women aged 2645, with cases increasing with age. Despite these figures, misinformation about fibroid causes and risk factors continues to spread on social media. Recently, an X user, @Neo_officiall, alleged that excessive use of oral contraceptives can cause fibroid growth. Since this post was made on March 2, 2025, it has amassed 139,500 views, 63 comments, 245 reposts, and 122 bookmarks. Given the high prevalence of fibroids among women and the virality of the post, DUBAWA decided to investigate this. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in the uterus. They range in size and are influenced by hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone. While fibroids are common, their exact cause remains unknown. Not all fibroids cause symptoms , but when they do, symptoms can include heavy menstrual bleeding, back pain, frequent urination, and pain during sex. Most fibroids happen in people of reproductive age. Studies show that fibroids grow when hormone levels are higher (like during pregnancy) and shrink when hormone levels are low (like during the transition to menopause). Medical research continues to study fibroids for the cause of growth and effective treatments. Two major components known for stimulating the growth of fibroids are estrogen and progesterone. Birth control pills contain both of these elements. According to the Mayo Clinic, several risk factors can increase ones chances of developing fibroids. These can include Obesity and a higher body mass index (BMI), a family history of fibroids, not having children, early onset of menstruation (getting your period at a young age), and late age for menopause. This 2021 study suggests that oral contraceptives may increase the risk of developing uterine fibroids or cause existing fibroids to grow larger, particularly due to the hormonal content, especially estrogen, which fibroids are responsive to. However, other research indicates that long-term use of oral contraceptives might reduce the risk of developing fibroid. According to Yan Katsnelson, a surgical expert, the exact cause of fibroids is not currently known. However, researchers believe they are linked to higher levels of certain hormones. Theres no one-size-fits-all rule on which birth control method is right for people with fibroids. In some cases, hormonal birth control may help regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent extreme fluctuations in progesterone and estrogen levels, explains Katsnelson. However, the influx of additional hormones may contribute to fibroid growth. Every person needs to discuss their options for birth control with their physician, especially if a diagnosis of fibroids has already been established, says Katsnelson. Another medical physician, Doctor Stan, noted that taking too many birth control pills causes fibroid growth is an oversimplification and not strongly supported by scientific evidence. Fibroids develop due to various factors, mainly hormonal changes, and the link between birth control pills and their growth is not proven. The claim that excessive use of oral contraceptives causes fibroid growth is misleading. No strong medical evidence supports this. Experts suggest that if you have concerns about fibroids or contraceptives, you should consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.",0
"Claim: An Instagram blog claimed that the New UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer made allegations about corruption in Nigeria while delivering a speech at the UK Parliament. Verdict: False! Contrary to the claim, the video and speech date back to 2020 and were made by British MP Tom Tugendhat, not Mr Starmer. For many years, the Nigerian government has faced persistent allegations of corruption from the international community. Organisations like Transparency International often raise these concerns. Transparency International publishes a yearly Corruption Perception Index ranking countries based on perceived levels of public sector corruption. Nigeria has consistently ranked low on this index. While specific concerns range from the misappropriation of Public Funds, oil Sector Corruption, and the lack of effective action, critics have argued that the Nigerian government doesnt do enough to investigate and prosecute corruption cases. At the same time, supporters say the Nigerian government has taken steps to address them, pointing at efforts such as establishing anti-corruption agencies and enacting relevant legislation. However, the effectiveness of these efforts has remained a matter of ongoing debate, even as the international community continues to urge Nigeria to strengthen its anti-corruption measures and hold perpetrators accountable. While these conversations persist, an Instagram blogging page @goldmynecanada on July 10, 2024, claimed in a post that the new UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, took a position about corruption in Nigeria. The post had an attached video purportedly showing him speaking on the floor of the UK parliament. The posts caption reads, New UK Prime Ministers position on Nigeria, and an excerpt from the speech reads: Some people will remember when General Gown left Nigeria with half the Central Bank and moved to London. As of July 15, 2024, the post had been viewed over 103,000 times, generating over 3,000 likes, 648 retweets, and 220 comments on the social media platform Instagram. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed excitement and disbelief. An X user, @ magicayg , wrote: Sir, thank you o!!!! Abeg help us, while @ samiiieee____ wrote, He made this speech in the parliament a few years ago. I hope he still takes this stance for Nigeria. Another user, @ skysapphireblue12 , expressing disbelief, wrote: This video is old now. He is not the New Prime Minister. Why dont you guys verify details before posting? Having observed the various reactions and engagement generated by the post, DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. After subjecting the video screenshot to a Google Reverse Image Search, DUBAWA discovered that the video has existed since 2020 . It first surfaced on November 23, 2020, during the #EndSARS debate by the UK Parliament. The man in the video was the British Minster of State Tom Tugendhat , who spoke during the #EndSARS debate by the UK Parliament on a petition regarding the arbitrary use of force and brutality by Nigerian security forces. At the time, Mr Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs committee in the British House of Commons, did not substantiate his claim with any evidence. His utterance sparked several reactions from Gowon , the Nigerian government , and even the UK Parliament , which disassociated itself from the ministers utterances. DUBAWA also conducted a keyword search, which brought up a transcript of the debate as documented on the parliament page, where Mr Tugendhat first made the allegations. Several media platforms also reported the event , corroborating that the timing of the video and the personality involved date back to 2020. See some here and here . Our findings show that the claim that the New UK Prime Minister took a position about corruption in Nigeria is false. The person in the video is the British MP Tom Tugendhat. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Diamond 88.5 FM Nigeria, to enrich the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Although pharmaceutical breakthroughs in medicine have occurred, reliance on traditional medicine is still prevalent in Africa today. Below are a host of assertions suggesting various womens health conditions traditional medicine allegedly cures. A Facebook user claimed cloves and garlic clean the womb. The claim is false as reliable medical journals and medical experts have not provided any medical or clinical explanation regarding the assertion. Read more here . A Facebook user claimed that consuming only beans and soursop within two weeks can cure prostate, cervical, and breast cancer. However, the claim is false, as the items mentioned are food, and although there is no harm in consuming them, they should not be thought of as remedies for curing the cancers mentioned above.

A Facebook user alleged in a post that tender guava leaves are a remedy for miscarriages and pregnancy spotting. But the claim is false. Consuming soaked guava leaves is not a remedy for miscarriage or spotting pregnancy. Rather, miscarriages and spotting during pregnancy may be due to infection, trauma, or implantation bleeding.

"Claim: An X user posted footage of a deteriorating train railway claiming it is the new rail transport system commissioned by Tinubus administration in Port Harcourt. Verdict: False. Findings reveal that the video was initially posted in 2021 during former President Mohammadu Buharis tenure, and the train in the video is not the one that was launched by President Bola Tinubu. On May 1, 2024, the Minister of Transportation, Said Alkali, commissioned a railway track linking Port Harcourt to Maiduguri via Aba. The track would cover five geopolitical zones of the country, including South-South, South-East, North-Central, North-West, and North-East. Meanwhile, an X user ( @IamThatNaijaGuy ) on May 10, 2024, shared a video showing an old shabby-looking train carriage and stated it was the new trains commissioned by the Minister of Transportation under the auspices of the President Bola Tinubu-led administration. This is what the (Port Harcourt- Aba) train shuttle recently launched by Tinubu looks like, the X user wrote. Nigeria borrowed billions of dollars to build this railway and acquire this ultra-modern high speed train. Tinubu is truly working, he further wrote. As of Monday, May 13, 2024, the post has amassed over 6,000 views, 186 likes, 139 reposts, 26 quotes, and 36 bookmarks. In the comment section, other X users lashed out at the government for its poor leadership and orientation, while some pointed out that the video is not authentic. Terrible people leading Nigerians, ( @Okoyeok ) commented. After borrowing billions of dollars. They have nothing for the South East and South South, @Enemy_of_Evil commented. This is an old video, ( @pertensbola ) pointed out. Due to the controversial opinions the post has generated, DUBAWA decided to verify it. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search and discovered that a video with the same narrative was posted on Metas parent app, Facebook, in 2021 . Meanwhile, further findings reveal a YouTube 2021 video , where a man was seen voicing dissatisfaction with the poor condition of the train system in the South East. The trains have explicit similarities with the one identified in the claim. Screenshot of a Youtuber lamenting the degrading state of trains plying Port Harcourt-Aba, in a 2021 video clip President Bola Tinubu was not inaugurated as president of Nigeria until May 29, 2023 . DUBAWA searched via Google for the new railway project of Port Harcourt to Aba, inaugurated by Minister of Transportation Said Alkali on May 1, 2024. We discovered that its trains are quite different from the one referenced in the video claim. Screenshot of the railway track from Port Harcourt to Aba commissioned by the Minister of Transport on May 1, 2024 Channels Television also gives a similar report.

"This is among many things that were found during the Flood in Maiduguri, bundles of different currencies stained in the mud, reads a post on a public Facebook group with over 291,000 members. The 27 September 2024 post features a photo of bundles of money covered in mud. The city of Maiduguri is in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria. On 10 September, heavy rains caused the Alau Dam to burst, devastating the city and surrounding areas. The floods caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure and affected almost 400,000 people. In response, the Nigerian government mobilised relief efforts to provide food, shelter and medical assistance to those affected. The same claim can be seen here and here . (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But was this money found during the Maiduguri floods? We checked. No evidence its from Maiduguri floods Africa Check ran the photo through a Google reverse image search and found that it appeared mostly on Arabic-speaking social media accounts. For example, one user posted it on 21 September with a caption in Arabic, but gave no details about where the photo was taken. The Instagram account northern_khartoumstudents also posted the same image. Khartoum is the capital of Sudan , a country in northeastern Africa. A closer look at the cash also confirms our suspicion, as some of the bank notes appear to be Sudanese 1,000 and 100 notes. An online search for the claim led to a 22 September news report with the same photo. We translated the report using machine translation and found it reported that money hidden in a warehouse in Sudan was washed away by floodwaters. We found no proof that the photo is from the floods in Maiduguri, Nigeria. Similar posts were found here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"CLAIM: News reports by Kakaaki News, Sahara Reporters, Punch, and some other media outlets have it that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by Interpol. True. The claim that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria is true but it is not a recent development. A news report by Kakaaki news , Sahara Reporters, Punch and some other media outlets, on Tuesday December 29, 2020, claimed that EUR 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by the International Criminal Police Organisation known as Interpol. According to these reports, this was contained in a statement on the organisations website titled Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed. Dubawa visited Interpols site to find this statement and also conducted a keyword search. The result of this search showed similar reports on this was published by the Punch on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020. The search also led to a document published on April 14, 2020 on Interpols site titled Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed as claimed in the report. The document noted that this happened around March when countries were going into Lockdown and the need for face masks which was one of the control measures for COVID-19 was high. This case of fraud was described as a sophisticated fraud scheme that used compromised emails with payment for the supply of face masks. According to the document, the German health authorities contracted two sales companies in Zurich and Hamburg to procure EUR 15 million worth of face masks. An agreement for an initial delivery of 1.5 million masks was made, in exchange for an up-front payment of EUR 1.5 million. The buyers initiated a bank transfer to Ireland and prepared for delivery, but before the delivery date, the buyers were informed that the funds had not been received and that an emergency transfer of EUR 880,000 straight to the Dutch supplier was required to secure the merchandise. The email address linked to a legitimate company in Spain selling face masks was compromised and its website cloned. This was uncovered by financial institutions and authorities across Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The document showed that nearly EUR 500,000 of those funds had already been sent to the United Kingdom, all of which was destined for an account in Nigeria. Two suspects in the Netherlands were arrested as at the time the document was released in April. Subsequently, in September 2020, another report was published on Interpol which indicated that two suspects linked to the mask fraud were arrested in Nigeria. Dubawa also reached out to Kakaki News, the Punch and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, to enquire why this case of fraud is just being reported since the information has been released by Interpol since April 2020. As at Thursday morning, December 31, 2020, none of the news sites had responded. The claim in the reports by Kakaaki News, Punch and Sahara Reporters that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria is true as Interpols document showed this was part of the 880,000 which had been transferred from the German company to the United Kingdom destined for a Nigerian account. This is however not a recent development as Interpol had published details of this since April 2020.",1
"Claim: Under President George Weah, the inflation rate has gone up, a TV anchor in Nigeria asserts. Verdict: Misleading! Inflation has not gone up in Liberia. As Liberias presidential and legislative elections draw closer, politicians have been campaigning vehemently to win the hearts and minds of citizens. These election campaigns are fought on issues, particularly corruption, security, cost of living etc. These issues are of great concern to the voters in previous elections as they are to them in the upcoming ones. In an era of a global crisis fueled by the worldwide pandemic, one of the most critical issues of concern to Liberian voters is the cost of living driven by the prices of goods and services. Over the last few days, there has been some controversy over whether or not inflation has gone up under the Weah administration. This debate was triggered by an interview with the immediate past Vice President of Liberia, now the standard bearer of the main opposition Unity Party (UP), Ambassador Joseph Nyumah Boakai, on a local news network in Nigeria, Arise News , during which he promised to rescue Liberia from its current leadership headed by President George Weah. During the interview, one of the hosts, Ayo Mairo-Ese , suggested to Ambassador Boakai that prices of goods (inflation rate) in Liberia have gone up under President George Weah. She, therefore, wanted to find out from the candidate what he would do about the rising cost of goods and services if he were voted into power. In response, Ambassador Boakai affirmed the hosts suggestion and assured viewers of his commitment to deal with inflation if voted into power. The show was held on December 6, 2022, in Nigeria and was carried live on Arise News TV network with 7.5k viewers and hundreds of engagements. Madam Ayo Mairo-Ese made the claim at 13:40-50 seconds of the over 19 minutes show. Legitimate as the question may be, there has been controversy over whether inflation has gone up under the current administration. This has generated a lot of controversy in the social and traditional media, as seen here , with the author of the latter encouraging President Weah to ensure that his promises to fight inflation, corruption and other economic problems are fulfilled. DUBAWA, therefore, feels obligated to investigate whether or not inflation has gone up under President George Weah. To ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah. Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses. The Internation al Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition which states: inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time. To ascertain the claim, it is important to understand what inflation is and to track the inflation rate before and during the tenure of President George Weah. Inflation is defined as a rise in the prices of goods and services across the economy, eroding purchasing power for consumers and businesses. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) also has a similar definition inflation is the rate of increase in price over some time. President Weah was voted into power in December 2017. Before his election, Liberias inflation rate in 2016 was 8.83% . Data cited by DUBAWA indicate that Liberias inflation rate rose to 12.42% in 2017, a 3.59% increase from 2016 and in 2018, 23.56%, a huge 11.14% increase from 2017. Since then, the rate of inflation has been drastically declining. According to the World Bank in Liberia, the September 30, 2022, latest report titled Liberias poverty reduction strategy is supported by the rebuilding of core functions and institutions, rehabilitating infrastructure, and facilitating growth, under Economic overview, Liberias inflation rate is put at 6.5% as of July 2022. According to the World Bank report, despite higher global fuel and food prices, inflation remained contained in 2021 and during the first half of 2022. Annual average inflation declined to 7.9% in 2021, down from 17.4% in 2020 and has moderated further to 6.5% in July 2022. Also, per the latest report published by Aaron ONeill on December 2, 2022 , under the caption Inflation Rate in Liberia, the rate of inflation is 6.9%. Based on the above, it is misleading to suggest that the inflation rate has gone up under the Weah-led administration. Data from reputable sources, including the World Bank, indicate that inflation increased only in the first year of his administration but has since taken a tumble to 6.5% in 2022, lower than the 8.3% it inherited.",1

"Claim: X users Ogie (@marythesa) and Pastor Okezie J. Atani (@ONgbonu) claimed in a viral video that the government demolished the House of the impeached deputy governor of Edo State, Philip Shuaibu. Verdict: MISLEADING. While available findings show the security post outside the impeached Deputy Governor, Philip Shuaibs house, was demolished, the state Commissioner for Communication and Orientation said that it is not part of Mr Shuaibs building. The former Deputy Governor of Edo state, Philip Shuaib, was impeached from office on Apr. 8, 2024, over alleged misconduct. Subsequently, Marvelous Omobayo was sworn in as the new deputy governor of Edo state. However, on Apr. 15, 2024, X users Ogie (@marythesa) and Pastor Okezie J. Atani (@ONgbonu) claimed that the PDP-led government had demolished the residence of the impeached deputy governor The now-deleted video by Pastor Okezie J.Atani garnered 11.8 views, 59 reposts, 19 quotes, 126 likes, and 15 bookmarks. The video with the caption, This is the Edo state Impeached deputy governor House, Philip Shuaib being demolished with Bulldozer by the PDP led government yesterday without giving Philip any prior notice o! This isnt fair at all. Not fair The video, also posted by Ogie (@marythesa), garnered 11.8 views, 19 reposts, 46 likes, and 19 quotes. This is Philip Shuaibuss house. Obaseki used his bulldozer to go and demolish it yesterday without giving Philip any prior notice o! Anyway, Philip you laid your bed this way so better lay on it like that! Your karma came so fast. Next time, you (will) learn not to bite the fingers that fed you! So sad! The video caption reads. In the comment session, an X user, olatunde (@one Naija Patriot), writes, I have no iota of pity for Philip Shuaibu. He dug his grave the day he teamed up with Obaseki to humiliate Oshiomole and did 360 years later to stand against the same Obaseki. He should eat his humble pie like that. Also, another user, Aux Osahon (@ AuzOsahon) said, Bros dat na security post na and it not suppose to be there in the first place Who dey build security post across d road. thats not part of his house him land nor reach there bro. Another commentator (@adekings2020) wrote, Watching this video shows that nothing happened to Philip Shuaib. The demolition was on the road; nothing happened to the fence. Why are people using SM to propagate fake stories? From the video posted by Pastor Okezie J Atani (@ONsogbu), it was observed that a female voice was narrating the incident, stating the men who came for the demolition said they were from the government house on instructions to carry out the exercise. Due to the contradicting comments and virality of the post, DUBAWA decided to verify and set the record straight. DUBAWA observed that in the video, a bulldozer pulled down the security post outside the building, not the main building, contrary to the assertion. The commissioner for communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, said the security post was not part of the Shuaibs residence . The Edo state Government had given Shuaib the privilege of enjoying an extra security presence in his house, but since hes a private citizen and his security has been withdrawn, the security structure can not stand. Its an illegal structure, but there is no plan to demolish its main building, Nehikhare stated. We also conducted a keyword search that led to news reports by Punch and The Guardian . These reports revealed that the officials of the Edo State Network and public works volunteers pulled down the security post in front of the residence of the former deputy governor, Philip Shuaibu, in the government reserve area, Benin. DUBAWA findings show that the house of the impeached deputy Governor of Edo state, Shuaib Philips, was not demolished, making the claim misleading.

"Claim: Male organs stolen in Abuja and Lokoja were sold in dollars as meat. Verdict : The image used to depict the narrative illustrates a Turkish traditional delicacy called rdan. This food has no ties to Nigeria and is not linked to the alleged stolen organ incidents in Abuja and Lokoja. The claim is misleading. The authenticity of the narratives surrounding organ theft continues to spark controversy in Nigeria, with DUBAWA having previously debunked claims on this subject. Recently, there have been reports of male organ theft in various parts of the FCT, Kogi, and Nasarawa, leading to mob attacks on suspected perpetrators. Despite some fatalities, a few individuals have also fortunately been rescued by the police. Following investigations, the police have refuted organ theft claims, urging the public to refrain from spreading false alarms. After the police warning, Rashidat Yusuf , a Facebook user, asserted in a post that male organs stolen in Abuja and Lokoja were allegedly sold as meat for dollars. She shared a photo of meats in a big pot, purportedly resembling male genitals. A man in the same picture seemed to be dishing the meal on a plate. She wrote, Abuja and Lokoja men, please be careful ohh! So they dont exchange your machines with dollars. Nothing this oyibo people nor fit chop. See all the missing machines here na. When some users like Aminat Yusuf, Aminat Attah, and Promise Amachagi questioned the genuineness of her claim in the comment section, Ms. Yusuf maintained her stance, insisting that pictures dont lie. Given the assertive nature of Ms Yusufs claim, DUBAWA conducted this fact-check to set the records straight. We performed a Google Reverse Image Search on the attached picture, revealing many similar images linked to a renowned Turkish dish known as rdan. rdan is prepared with the stomachs of ruminant animals and is a popular delicacy in Turkey. The preparation involves stuffing a sheeps abomasum (lower stomach) with a blend of rice, chopped meat, onions, tomatoes, chili pepper, salt, pepper, oil, and seasoning. After sewing the open cavity with a needle and thread, the dish is boiled on low heat and served. Remarkably, when ready, this meal assumes a distinctive shape reminiscent of a male reproductive organ. rdan is an old traditional recipe of Adana , one of the most populous cities in Turkey. Just like Nigerians Suya , this street food is mostly sold by local sellers in the evening. YouTube videos by Yemekturkiyecom and Milliyiyici further give a breakdown of its preparation process. Our findings prove that the displayed image is unrelated to Nigeria and has no connection to the reported missing organ incidents in Abuja and Lokoja. Rather, it showcased a Turkish traditional delicacy known as rdan. Hence, Ms Yusufs claim is misleading.",1
"Claim: The purported letter from U.S Ambassador McCarthy accusing Liberians in the USA of spreading information is fake, says activist Martin K.N. Kollie Verdict: False. The letter is not purported, it is real, and the link is on the US Embassy Facebook page. In addition, the US Ambassador near Monrovia on Tuesday, March 14, 2023, voiced the accusation against Liberians with reporters. Liberians residing in the United States who were noted for using the traditional media or radio stations back home to spew allegations were shocked after the US embassy openly debunked their actions. The US envoy in Liberia said most of the controversies emerging in Liberian media ahead of the elections originated from the United States. Today, I am ashamed to tell you that the most irresponsible controversies to emerge in Liberias media over the past month have originated from the United States. While responsible critical observations from the Liberian diaspora can be healthy, some cowardly media personalities and political personalities have intentionally disseminated rumours or misinformation into Liberias political environment from the safety of their studios and offices in the U.S., Ambassador McCarthy said in his opening remarks with the anti-corruption coordinators. His statement comes on the heels of allegations by persons based in the US that City Mayor of Monrovia, Jefferson Koijee, masterminded the killing of former Chief Justices daughter, Charloe Musu, by sponsoring a City police officer, Varlee Telleh, who is an ex-fighter for former President Charles Taylor during Liberias civil crisis. Liberian lawyer Jerome Verdier, currently residing in the US, made this particular allegation. He was also the online guest panellist on the SpoonTalk show. The Mayor, who was accused of masterminding the murder, has, through his legal team, challenged Verdier to provide evidence to authenticate his claim to help the Police force with an ongoing investigation. Verdier is not the only person known for trading allegations and disinformation. Martin Kollie, who also resides in the diaspora but is vocal on local issues in Liberia, is known to have traded some false news as well, one of which was investigated by DUBAWA. For example, his claim about the doctor to patients ratio in the country was found to be palpably false after DUBAWA Fact-Checked the claim. Attached is the report . In discussing the issue raised by Liberias US Ambassador about disinformation from Liberians in the US, Martin Kollie sought to deny there was no such comment by the US Ambassador. He alleged the comment attributed to the US Ambassador was no more than pro-CDC propaganda being shared on Facebook. Kollies post, dated March 15, 2023 , has generated over two hundred controversial comments, thirty-one shares and 292 Facebook likes and emojis. Though some Facebook commenters disagreed with the claimant under his post, others believed him. Given the mention of a prominent diplomat and the significance of the information to Liberia and its biting effects on the nation, DUBAWA decided to verify the post by activist Martin K.N. Kollie. Again, as a result of the controversy generated by Martin Kollies post, insisting the comment by the Ambassador was non-existent, DUBAWA had every responsibility to verify if the US Ambassadors comment was indeed made. The researcher found a link to the statement made by the US Ambassador, which is on the verified US Embassy Facebook page. In addition, audio recording of Ambassador McCarthy was played during one of the prime shows on OK FM, the Afternoon Conversation Ambassador McCarthy, speaking at a news conference recently said, While responsible critical observations from the Liberian diaspora can be healthy, some cowardly media personalities and political personalities have intentionally disseminated rumours or misinformation about Liberias environment from the safety of their studios and offices in the US. These people are motivated by disruption and a desire to break down trust in Liberian institutions- they dont care what damage they cause. When questioned by law enforcement, they do not have evidence to back up their claims. Unfortunately, they take advantage of Americas first amendment rights to spread rumours and stir up trouble in your country, which is despicable behaviour. Contrary to claims the information could not be accessed on the website of the US Embassy in Monrovia, DUBAWA can confirm it is online. From the information gathered, it is clear that activist Martin K.N. Kollie lied about the US ambassadors statement about diaspora Liberians spreading false information from the US back home.

"Claim: A Facebook user, Agozi Commedy, claims that the suspended Rivers State Governor, Siminalayi Fubara, has been arrested by the federal government for disobeying President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Verdict: False. The Federal Government did not arrest Governor Fubara. The viral video is from a previous, unrelated event. On March 18, 2025, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu declared a state of emergency in Rivers State and suspended Governor Siminalayi Fubara, Deputy Governor Ngozi Odu, and all elected state assembly lawmakers for six months. Retired Vice Admiral Ibokette Ibas was appointed as the sole administrator to oversee the states affairs during this period. The decision followed a prolonged political crisis in the state, attributed mainly to the power struggle between Fubara and former Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, now Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. Following the declaration of a state of emergency, various narratives surfaced on social media. A Facebook user, Agozi Commedy , shared a video alleging that the Federal Government (FG) had arrested Governor Fubara for disobeying President Tinubu. The post was captioned: Breaking News: Federal government has just arrested Rivers State Governor SIM Fubara for disobeying President Tinubu Asiwaju. The post has garnered significant engagement, amassing over 2,000 comments, 14,000 reshares, and more than 11,000 likes. Among those who commented, Adanna Okoye remarked, Anytime I want to listen to fake news, I come to this page. Similarly, Chukwudinma Chukwurah urged others to disengage, stating, Please, lets unfollow this man. He is full of lies and fake news! Meanwhile, another user, John Omidiran, from Osun State, Southwest Nigeria, expressed scepticism about the situation, saying, Can someone explain this mans offence to me? Honestly, this doesnt add up. We have terrorists, Fulani herders, and kidnappers wreaking havoc across the country, yet no serious action is taken against them. Why are the rights of Rivers people being trampled on so recklessly? Due to the issues sensitivity, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. We conducted a Google Keyword search using Fubara + Arrest + Tinubu but found no reports from reputable media houses confirming the governors arrest. We used InVID WeVerify to analyse the over eight-minute video attached to the post. The footage shows a chaotic scene with security aides protecting the suspended governor while police officers fired tear gas canisters. At five minutes 43 seconds in the video, Governor Fubara is seen addressing the press. He said, Its very unfortunate that we are experiencing this kind of situation again, which is similar to what happened nine years ago. Everybody who knows me understands that I stand for truth. I am concerned that a taxpayer-funded facility is being destroyed, just to please someone. From what I have observed, security has been compromised. They were shooting at me, but it doesnt matter because we all die one day. I want to die so that when people hear the name Fubara, they will remember that I died for this struggle. I am not against anyone, and I have no hidden agenda. I dont know where all these attacks are coming from, but as the Chief Security Officer of the state, I should be the one ensuring safety, he added. Further analysis revealed that the video is old and was taken during an incident a year ago when the Rivers State House of Assembly was gutted by fire. Parts of the video were found in a previous news report by Channels Television titled, Gov Fubara Inspects Burnt Rivers Assembly Complex Amid Police Resistance. DUBAWAs findings reveal that Governor Fubara was not arrested but vacated the Government House following his suspension. The claim that the federal government arrested Siminalayi Fubara is false. The viral video circulated is an old clip from a previous event involving the governors visit to the Rivers State House of Assembly after a fire incident. There is no credible evidence to support the claim of his arrest.",0

"Claim: An X user posted that homosexuality was removed from the World Health Organizations (WHO) list of mental illnesses on May 17, 1990. Verdict: The claim is TRUE. On May 17, 1990, the WHO officially removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, recognising it as a natural variation of human sexuality, not a mental illness. Discussions about whether homosexuality should be considered a universal norm have intensified, particularly as various countries parliaments debate bills that criminalise advocacy for gay rights and propose jail terms for those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or identify as transgender (LGBTQ). Currently, about 64 countries have laws that criminalise homosexuality, with nearly half of these nations located in Africa. However, some countries, including several in Africa, have recently moved to decriminalise same-sex unions and enhance rights for LGBTQ individuals. Conversely, other countries, such as Nigeria and Uganda , have tightened existing laws against homosexuality. While some persons have recently gone online to argue that LGBTQ is not a mental illness ( here ), with counterarguments ( here ), an X user, Oseni Rufai (@ruffydfire), posted on May 17, 2024, claiming that homosexuality was removed from WHOs list of mental illnesses on May 17, 1990. The post read: May 17, 1990, Homosexuality removed as a mental illness from W.H.O list. This post has garnered over 27,000 views, 261 likes, and 113 reposts as of May 18, 2024. In support of the claim, an X user, Mackiyte (@Healthwolf2), commented that homosexuality is not a mental illness but a biological condition, stating, WHO was right about that. However, the comment section also featured counter-opinions. Screenshot of the post and reactions. To verify this claim, DUBAWA conducted a comprehensive search across credible sources. A keyword search on the World Health Organizations (WHO) website confirmed that May 17 is recognised as the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia. This day commemorates the removal of homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) on May 17, 1990, when the World Health Assembly ceased to classify it as a mental disorder. Further searches corroborated this information through various publications , social media posts , and videos marking May 17 as the International Day Against Homophobia. Cross-referencing historical records showed that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declassified homosexuality as a mental illness in 1973. Meanwhile, the WHO, which had listed homosexuality in the ICD-9 in 1977, removed it from the ICD-10, endorsed by the 43rd World Health Assembly on May 17, 1990. Why homosexuality was initially classified as a mental Illness Homosexuality was initially classified as a mental illness by the APA and WHO due to prevailing societal and medical attitudes. The APA categorised it as a sociopathic personality disturbance and later as a sexual deviation, grouped with fetishes and paedophilia. This reflected the belief that homosexuality was pathological and required treatment. Homosexuality was declassified following research showing it is a natural variation of human sexuality and not associated with mental illness. Advocacy by mental health professionals and LGBTQ activists also influenced this change. The APA removed it from their list in 1973, and the WHO followed in 1990, aiming to reduce stigma and align with contemporary scientific understanding. The declassification recognised that homosexuality is a sexual orientation, just as heterosexuality is, and not a mental disorder. Based on the evidence from credible sources, the claim that the WHO removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders on May 17, 1990, is true. This decision acknowledged that homosexuality is a natural variation of human sexuality, not a mental disorder. The declassification aimed to reduce stigma and align with modern scientific understanding, affirming homosexuality as a sexual orientation just like heterosexuality. It is commemorated annually on the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia.

"Claim: A viral message making the rounds on WhatsApp and referenced to Nuhu Ribadu, Former boss of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) claims that President Muhammadu Buhari instigated banditry in Nigeria to oust former President Goodluck Jonathan. The viral WhatsApp message is misleading. There is no confirmed source to the story and the spokesperson to Ribadu has debunked the message, tagging it as fake news. Before the 2015 general elections, insecurity was a major problem in the Nigerian society. While most of the attacks experienced were referenced to Boko Haram, banditry was not much of a topical issue then. However, fast forward to 2018, till now, Banditry has become a prominent issue in the centre of Nigerias security issue. Since its emergence, security analysts have been trying to understand its nature, sponsorship and patterns of attacks. It is in the light of this reality, that a viral WhatsApp message claims that Muhammadu Buhari, the current Nigerian president instigated banditry to oust Goodluck Jonathan, who was then president of the country until his defeat by the latter in the 2015 general elections. The acclaimed message is referenced to Nuhu Ribadu, the former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and has already been shared several times on WhatsApp, and on and recently even published in a feature magazine; rendering an unverified account of the origin of banditry in the country. The viral message also alleged that Buhari sought the services of mercenaries, who were recruited from neighbouring countries, to claim power for the Fulani group in case he loses the 2015 presidential election. To give credibility to the narrative, the message was attributed to the former EFCC boss, Nuhu Ribadu as the author. The same viral message as featured in Savanna Express Magazine with picture of Nuhu Ribadu Nuhu Ribadu, is a former Nigerian Police Officer and Politician. He was the Chairman of the Petroleum Revenue Task force and eventually the founding chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), the Nigerian government anti corruption body. EFFC, from 20032007. Dubawa analysed the message and found out that it was highly disjointed with a lot of spelling errors. Typical errors that should not have been prevalent with such important acclaimed messages, and also questionable in the essay of Nuhu Ribadu, who authored a book. The reporter further reached out to the Publisher of the feature magazine, SAVANNA EXPRESS, where the article was published in Vol 9, No 98 ISSN 98760 -5432, Page 39 40 on 23rd June 2021 with the caption: Nuhu Ribadu: BOMBSHELL ON BANDITRY . In his response, as regards the source to the story, Mr Michael Eluwa, the publisher of the Savanna Magazine, who did not deny publishing the article, admitted that he was practicing guerilla Journalism to fight the government as such he wont disclose the source of the information. In a bid to uncover the actual genealogy of the story, Dubawa also reached out to Nuhu Ribadus former aide and journalist, AbdulAziz AbdulAziz, who said that the message has been on since June 2019 and a rebuttal regarding the acclaimed message has been sent out by Nuhu Ribadu, using his social media handles. AbdulAziz, added that the former EFCC Chairman has even called on security agencies to investigate the origin of the message and prosecute those behind it, but was surprised the message was still trending on social media. AbdulAziz beckoned to the public to disregard the message, which he described as clear insanity and a cheap blackmail. Further scrutiny by Dubawa showed that there was no such report in any credible media organisations. Even so, Dubawa found out that the message wrongly captured Nuhu Ribadu who was Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) in 2014 not the Deputy Superintendent (DSP) of Police as posed by the message. This message allegedly written by Nuhu Ribadu titled Bandits were created by Muhammadu Buhari to oust Jonathan is misleading.

"CLAIM: 37-year-old South African woman delivers decuplets to break a world record. VERDICT: FALSE. The Guinness World Record (GWR) currently recognises a Malian woman, Halima Cisse, who delivered nonuplets in 2021 in Casablanca, Morocco. Multiple media reports highlight controversies surrounding the birth of decuplets by Ms Sithole, dismissing every iota of truth. On Monday, August 7, 2023, a Facebook user, Babies First, posted a seemingly incredible childbirth story involving a 37-year South African woman who purportedly delivered decuplets in a single delivery. Incredible achievement: South African woman, 37, breaks world record with the birth of 10 children(.) The user informed. Along with the post, the user posted numerous pictures of the woman with her husband and infants. Also attached with the post is a related article written by Beautiful Life and published by Media Guide Internet Database (MGID). The article identified the woman as Gosiame Sithole, 37, who recently gave birth to 10 babies and could break the Guinness World Record for the most children born in a single delivery. It further mentions that seven boys and three girls were among the decuplets whom she delivered at a hospital in Pretoria. Among the details of the story is Ms Sitholes husband (whom we later identified as Tebogo Tsotetsis) revelation that before the delivery of the decuplets, Ms Sithole had delivered a set of twins and was only excited to have more children. The story also mentions that the couple was hit with criticism and disbelief from people who termed their story a hoax. Ms Sithole and her husband had to tender medical records and ultrasound scans to restate peoples doubts. According to the article, the hospital also rescued the couple by confirming the situation. But the reception to the news was quite different in the comment section as congratulations and heartfelt wishes continued to stream. Wonderful, thank God for you, Fidelis Oguaka remarked . Wonders of Almighty God. Congratulations, Afusat Atinuke Braimoh wrote . Overall, as of Monday, August 7, 2023, the post attracted 15,000 likes and 1,500 comments and was shared 184 times. Due to the novelty of the news, we decided to check for the claims veracity. We first checked the Guinness World Record (GWR)s official website . We discovered that Halima Cisse, a Malian, who delivered nonuplets in a single birth back in 2021, is still the one recognised as the woman with the highest delivery of babies in a single birth. That discovery further made us check for news reports related to Ms Sitholes story, and we discovered that multiple news outlets, including United Kingdom-based Independent , British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) , and Nigerias Guardian newspapers, all in June 2021, reported that the news was false. The Independent highlighted controversies surrounding the tale, and a report from the then-acting public protector, Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka, termed the news a lie. The UK-based news outlet mentions a 57-page report made public on December 30, 2022 that unearths the fact that Ms Sothole was never denied access to her babies, and there wasnt any evidence that she had even recently been pregnant or given birth. There were also records that she had not been to the Steve Biko Hospital since 2014, when she delivered her twins. The Independent further wrote that such an intriguing story was quickly unravelled because there was no sign of babies anywhere. In the uprising of the unamusing development, Ms Sithole was detailed to have been backed by both the editor of Pretoria News, Piet Rampedi, and the Executive Chairman of Independent Media, Iqbal Suave, who owns the paper, in her rather offhanded claims of being denied access to her babies. We further discovered that Pretoria News had done an exclusive interview with the couple and erroneously contradicted its report. It reported the birth of ten babies but explained the natural cause of only octuplets in its story. But both Mr Rampedi and Mr Suave werent the only ones that backed Ms Sitholes claims, as the Independent also reports that the gynaecologist, Dr Mpho Pooe, who was later discovered to be a fraud , also connived with the lot to uphold claims of denied access to Ms Sitholes babies. The outlet reported that the trio and Ms Sithole claimed that the decuplets were real but had been stolen as part of a vast human trafficking conspiracy. This account was also corroborated by the South African newspaper, The Citizen , where the men were reported to have accused the doctors, social workers, the government and anyone else who has ever demanded a shred of proof of Ms Sitholes decuplets of human trafficking. The Citizen further informs that the Guinness World Record (GWR) has questioned the claim since they have not been able to verify the birth and seen the babies. Both Mr Rampedi and Mr Suave claimed that instead of 10 live babies, only eight were born, as two others, supposedly located in the mothers fallopian tube, had died, according to The Citizen . And this only highlights the contradiction and discrepancy we observed earlier in the recount of their story. An official inquiry reported by BBC revealed that Ms Sithole, who lived with Teboho Tsotetsi, attended the same Church as the Editor of Pretoria News, Mr Rampedi. The latter was alleged to have interviewed the couple who informed that they were expecting babies with a photoshoot revealing a heavily pregnant Ms Sithole. BBC writes that the announcement of a surprise of 10 babies was made by Pretoria News on June 8, 2021, with Ms Sitholes partner, Mr Tsotetsi, as the source. Mr Tsotetsi said that he had gotten the news from Ms Sithole through text messages and that he wasnt allowed into the hospital due to the coronavirus restrictions. It was also reported that Mr Rampedi only relied on WhatsApp messages and was yet to get confirmation from the hospital. It wasnt until the local mayor confirmed the births that other news outlets reported it. However, the news could have as well been a hoax as a government spokesperson revealed that the mayor had only heard the familys word and no one saw the babies. But suspicion only grew when Pretoria News failed to disclose the hospital where the babies were born, and other hospitals in the area, Gauteng, publicly denied any association with the delivery. BBC reports that ten days after the announcement, Independent Media (owner of Pretoria News) hit Steve Biko Academic Hospital with accusations. Furthermore, there was a fallout between Mr Tsotetsi and Ms Sithole, as the former announced that Ms Sithole was missing and asked people to stop giving donations to her. Meanwhile, Sithole also accused her partner of wanting to benefit financially from her babies. BBC quoted Pretoria news. Ms Sithole was later found and admitted into the hospital for tests, as Gauteng local authorities informed. But BBC informs of a leaked memo reported by News24 that Mr Rampedi apologised to Independent Media for reputational damage for not reporting the story as an investigative piece rather than a feel-good story. We did a Google reverse image search and discovered that they are the 11 11 11 babies who were delivered at an In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in Surat, India. Fact Check also highlighted the story in an April 19, 2019 report. The claim is false. Guinness World Record (GWR) doesnt recognise Ms Sithole as the world title holder for the most delivered babies in a single birth. Multiple media reports highlight controversies surrounding the birth of decuplets by Ms Sithole, dismissing every iota of truth.",0
"Claim : A report from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), picked by some media outlets, claims the Controller General of Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) said the service has not recruited in the last 17years. The Nigerian Customs Service has denied not recruiting in the last 17 years, noting the recruitment gap that existed was long before Hameed Alis regime which is just six years old. A news report titled We cant effectively police the borders with 15,000 officers was Tweeted by The Cable, an online newspaper, with the caption that Hameed Ali, the Controller-General (CG) of Customs, said the service has not recruited in the past 17 years. On recruitment into the NCS, the CG said the service had not recruited in the past 17 years, adding that recruitment into the service was the prerogative of the president. The report originated from the News Agency of Nigeria, a news wire. Dubawa followed the link to the full story on Cables website to get more details. The report which noted this was an agency report from the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) was published on March 5, 2021. According to the NAN report, the CG made this claim at the presentation of the services 2021 budget, before the house committee on customs service, while noting the need for NCS to recruit officers as there is a gap in terms of officers currently in the service. Screenshot of the Cables report Dubawa conducted a keyword search which led to another report by the Guardian published on March 4, 2021, which quoted the CG as saying Nigerias border is extensive and porous. The story also has the claim that the service has not recruited in the past 17 years. Dubawa visited the NCS website to find more information but did not get any information on recruitment. However, Dubawa got the email address of the information unit of the service ( info@customs.gov.ng ) which we emailed to inquire about the claim but no response has been received so far. Dubawa also called the contact number available on the website and was asked to contact the Information Unit. Dubawa went ahead to speak with the National Public Relations Officer, Joseph Attah, who said this claim is not true. Acknowledging there was a time the service had a recruitment gap, Mr Attah noted this was before Mr Alis regime as CG. The new controller general came on board in 2015 which means he has just spent 6 years in office which is far less than the number of years the report claimed recruitment has not been attempted in the service. I am particularly surprised that this question is coming at a time we just rounded up our recruitment screening exercise across the country. It was held in Abuja, Kano, Owerri, Lagos and Bauchi. Yes, there was time recruitment was not done but that was long, even before his regime anyway so that gap is identified and that is what efforts are on to address them. Excerpt of NCS PROs comment. Also, in 2019, the NCS in a statement by the Secretary, Nigerian Customs Board, announced it was set to recruit 3,200 personnel to fill positions in the agency. In 2021, reports by MyJobMag , RecruitmentGate , and Careersng , show an ongoing recruitment exercise by the service across the North West, North East, North Central, South East, South West and South-South. The list for 2021 recruitment can be found here . Although the PRO did not give specific dates of this recruitment which he said took place last week, the reports above show this was between March 1 to March 10, 2021. Speaking on the issues of shortage of officials which the CG said makes it hard to police the border appropriately, the PRO said it is not just the need for manpower but the need for technology. The issue of policing the borders goes beyond the number of persons. Yes, manpower is an issue but working tools and as you these days you need more than human beings to police the border. Technology is invoked now in policing the international border. What 100 people can do, 5 or 10 people can do with very effective technology. Yes we understand that we need more manpower no doubt about that, we also need technology and that is what the government has addressed, the government just approved E-Customs which is end-end automation of the customs processes and procedures. Meaning that going forward, there will be non-intrusive equipment installed at all our entry points to help customs police the borders better. Excerpt of NCS PROs commeThat When asked what the current staff strength of the service was, he said it was around 15,000 but this will change after this recruitment. Currently we are in the region of 15,000 plus. But dont forget recruitment is going on now so, in the next one month, the figure I have given you will not be correct. Excerpt of NCS PROs comment. The Nigerian Customs Service has denied not recruiting in the last 17 years, noting the recruitment gap that existed was long before Hameed Alis regime which is just six years old. News reports also show recruitment in 2019 and 2021 which makes the claim misleading. EDITORs NOTE: This fact-check has been updated to reflect the original source as NAN and not TheCable.",1
"Claim: A TikTok post claims Cristiano Ronaldo scored the decisive winner for Real Madrid against Man City in a penalty shootout. Verdict: False. DUBAWAs investigation discovered that the TikTok video was edited. Real Madrid knocked out City in a penalty shootout only once in the 2023/2024 Champions League tournament, and Ronaldo was never part of that squad because the Portuguese left the club in 2018. Since the 2012/2013 season, Manchester City and Real Madrid have encountered each other 14 times . Of the 14 matches, Manchester City won four while Real Madrid won five, and both tied five times. Against this backdrop, a TikTok user, @unreal.0.5 1-12 , claims that former Real Madrid star and five-time Ballon dOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo scored the decisive winner from the spot kick for Spanish giants Real Madrid against Manchester City. In the clip, Erling Haaland, Ruben Diaz, Savio Oliveira (Savinho), and Phil Foden slotted in perfectly for City as Luka Vazquez, Marcelo Vieira, Sergio Ramos, and Gareth Bale levelled for Los Blancos. But Bernardo Silver saw his effort bounce off the goalkeeper minutes before Ronaldo struck a winner for Real, making it 5-4. As of Thursday, March 27, 2025, the post has earned 78,100 likes, 494 comments, and 1,900 shares. DUBAWA observed that other users commented diversely about the posts authenticity. Ronaldo will never lose, Mivuyo asserted. Love it. Ronaldo will never lose, Ekwunife2 commented. Edit, Mati observed. Due to the diverse replies to the post, DUBAWA decided to verify it. Verification DUBAWA checked the Champions League website for historical statistics between the two bitter rivals. We noticed that since their encounter in 2012/2013, Madrid has only knocked the English side via a penalty shootout once, which was in the 2023/2024 season. However, Ronaldo stopped playing for Real Madrid at the end of the 2017/2018 season after a reported rift with the clubs president, Florentino Perez. This means Los Blancos has never won penalty shootouts in a Champions League knockout stage with the Portuguese. Moreover, closely related to that, DUBAWA noticed from the TikTok video that Real Madrid legend and two-time best world club coach Zinedine Zidane was in charge of the Spanish side. Zidane managed Real Madrid in the 2015/2016, 2016/2017, and 2017/2018 seasons and returned in 2019. However, according to the Champions League data, Zidane only encountered City twice as Real Madrids coach. In his first charge as manager in 2015/2016, he clashed with the Citizens in the semifinals and won 1-0 on aggregate in the second leg. He would face them again four years later in the 2019/2020 round-of-16 stage, where City trashed Real Madrid 1-2 in the first leg and 2-1 in the second leg. None of the matches went into penalty shootouts with Zidane in charge, contrary to what the TikTok clip shows. We noticed several irregularities in the clip. One is that Norway international Haaland and Brazilian midfielder Savinho, purchased in 2022 and 2024 , respectively, were playing against Ronaldo in a Real Madrid shirt when the Portuguese departed the Spanish club for Italian side Juventus in 2018. Two, legendary defender Sergio Ramos departed Real Madrid in 2021, a year before Haaland started making appearances for City and three years before Savinhoyet, somehow, the Spanish appears to have been drawn against the duo in a penalty shootout. DUBAWA also discovered that current Manchester United first-choice goalkeeper Andre Onana appears to be manning the goal frame for Real Madrid in the penalty shootout. But when we checked his transfer history , we noticed that the Cameroonian has only played with the Dutch team AFC Ajax, Italian giants Inter Milan, and Premier League side Man United. He has never been contracted on loan or a permanent deal to play for Real Madrid. Finally, DUBAWA noticed that the City players shirt designs in the TikTok video differed. Haaland, Diaz, and Savinho all put on the 2024/2025 Man City outfit, while Foden and Silva were both wearing the 2023/2024 outfit. More trifling is Diaz wearing the 2024/2025 design before he slots in a goal from the spot-kick, but when he jubilates Savinhos goal, he is visibly seen alongside the rest of the team in the previous seasons shirt design. Football team players never wear different outfit designs in the same game (notably, just the shirt and shorts). It has to be uniform. Man Citys centre-back, Ruben Diaz, appears to have taken his spot-kick wearing the 2024/2025 outfit but cheers victoriously at teammate Savinhos goal in the 2023/2024 outfit. The claim is false. DUBAWAs investigation discovered that the TikTok video was edited. .",0
"Claim: A Facebook user, Khailan Arab , posted that dragonflies can eat 100 mosquitoes in a day and, therefore, serve as mosquito repellants. Verdict: The claim is true. A Google Search Engine churned out dozens of articles extolling the predatory nature of dragonflies in controlling insects in their environment. This includes their ability to eat 100 mosquitoes a day and other insects. Mosquitoes are regarded as the deadliest animal in the world through the spread of Malaria. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022, with 608,000 persons estimated to have died. Page 11 of the report identified Nigeria as having the highest number of deaths from malaria. Nigeria recorded 26.8% of global deaths from the disease, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%), and Mozambique (4.2%). Several efforts to eliminate the insect have not yielded much result. A Facebook account, Khailan Arab , claimed in a post that nature gave humans the ability to curtail the presence of mosquitoes through dragonflies. The post stated that the insect can consume 100 mosquitoes a day and thus could substitute for chemical-laden insecticides. The post then encouraged individuals to create gardens to attract dragonflies. It attracted 537 likes, 25 comments, and 200 shares on the platform. DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim to determine its authenticity. According to National Geographic , dragonflies are important to the environment as they serve as predators of mosquitoes and prey on birds and fish. Similarly, a report by the Dragonfly Website described dragonflies as voracious eaters that prefer mosquitoes and small flies. Each dragonfly can consume up to 100s of mosquitoes per day! They will also eat bees, butterflies, and even other dragonflies. An article by Treehugger quoted John Abbott, chief curator and director of Museum Research and Collections at the University of Alabama, saying that dragonflies have a huge appetite for mosquitoes. I think its fair to say that, given the opportunity, an individual dragonfly could take 100-plus mosquitoes in a day without too much of a problem, Abbott said in the article. Speaking with DUBAWA, a Biodiversity expert, Ojonugwa Ekpah , confirmed that the insect can eat 30 to 100 mosquitoes in a day. Dragonflies prey on mosquitoes, allowing them to reduce their population. A single dragonfly can eat thirty to hundreds of mosquitoes per day, making them a beneficial insect of ecological importance, he said. He added that dragonflies are expert fliers, and if they cant fly, they tend to starve as they only eat prey they catch while flying. The claim that dragonflies can eat 100 mosquitoes a day is true. Conservative experts and media articles have confirmed that the insects prey on mosquitoes and, thus, can serve as a natural anti-mosquito repellant.

"Claim: A user on Twitter claims that three Nigerian men were arrested in Dubai whilst faking to be Arab women. The claim that three Nigerian men were arrested in Dubai whilst faking to be Arab women is misleading. Findings show the men were arrested in Algeria, not in Dubai, and their nationalities were not disclosed by the Algerian police to be Nigerians. Hence, this claim is misleading. It is common among young Nigerians to seek greener pastures in advanced countries of the world. Interestingly, the concept is referred to as japa by Nigerians. While immigration in itself is not a bad aspiration, the illegal means some Nigerians used to depart to other nations seem to have brought a bad name to the country. As such, narratives around Nigerians illegally trying to migrate to other countries always seem to attract attention and assumptions. A typical example is a tweet that claims three Nigerian men were arrested in DUBAI for faking to be Arab women. The post was made by Alaya Kamal (@iam_skamal) and soon attracted over 1,000 reactions, alongside multiple comments from bewildered, doubting and believing users. One user, Dreal Kwaba (@chineduIH), commented thus: Lmaoooooooo My country men no dey ever fail. Constituting a nuisance everywhere. However, FOUNDATIONAL HUMAN BEING (@TosinFayanju), also another user, challenged the claim. The user wrote: People wont verify this and just be spreading it. Just as someone was spreading fake news Abt a Cameroon player. Calling his wife, his daughter. While, do_U_mind? (@PkHoody) perceived the tweet as an incredibly hilarious thing Nigerians can actually do. Nigeria should have a movie production company filming everyday citizens in the country. The whole country people are some way bi It didnt stop there. The claim also made it to the mainstream media, spreading the same narrative with more details attached to it. On hettysmedia, a report published on the claim, alongside the same picture, details that : Three Nigerian men dressed like Arab women have been arrested in Dubai by the Emirate security operatives. The Rifnote news and the Gulftoday news websites also featured this same narrative. Apparently, the claim has made appearances on different platforms but with the same narrative of Nigerians. While it is easy to dismiss this claim as truthful, the reputation and image of nations have been soiled in the past for such allegations that have often been unconfirmable. First, DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search to trace where the supporting picture of the alleged three men first appeared. The results trace the image to a video on a YouTube channel titled El Bilad TV Apparently, the TV reported on a network of local and foreign nationals of drug and human traffickers that were arrested by Algerian police in Algeria and not Dubai. Further details in the video did not mention if the men were Nigerians, but noted that they were arrested for smuggling drugs and other illegal substances while dressed up as women to evade law officials. Apparently, the event was popular news in Algeria. TSA Algerie, a prominent media outlet in Algeria, reported that: a group of traffickers of hard drugs was apprehended by the judicial police services of the wilaya of Algiers, announced Thursday, February 3, the DGSN in a press release. The report also outlines the seizure of 1.5 kg of hard drugs, including 780 grams of heroin, 670 grams of cocaine and 80 grams of cannabis by the police from the men. Regarding the mens nationality, the news report reveals that: This large-scale operation also made it possible to put an end to human trafficking in which this network made up of 14 people, including 4 Algerians and the 10 others of a foreign nationality, aged between 20 and 24, was engaged, according to the judicial police officer. Even more, findings show that the Algerian police have made a post on Facebook regarding the claim but with no mention of the actual nationality of the men, only describing them as a criminal network specialised in illegal trafficking of solid drugs. Findings show these men were arrested in Algeria by the Algerian police and not Dubai. Also, no fact points to the reality that these men were Nigerians or have anything to do with Nigeria. As such, this claim is misleading.",0
"To combat misinformation and disinformation, the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) has announced that two Nigerian-based fact-checking platforms, FactsMatterNG and News Verifier Africa, along with 37 other fact-checking organisations, will receive a $25,000 grant each.

Moreover, most grant recipients will use the fund to strengthen their workforce and improve their financial sustainabilitya lingering issue amongst 84 per cent of fact-checking organisations . The Director of IFCN, Angie Drobnic, emphasised the significance of these grants in enhancing the global network of fact-checkers. In this critical election year, the need for accurate information couldnt be more urgent. This vital funding will energize fact-checking organisations, sharpening their skills, amplifying their capabilities, and expanding their reach. As we navigate the complexities of global voting, fact-checking fosters a culture of critical thinking that leads to a more informed electorate, said Ms Drobnic. Since the first award in June 2023, the IFCN has distributed $4,850,000 of the $12 million fund provided by Google and YouTube to several dozen fact-checking groups worldwide. The fund is expected to continue with five more phases. Meanwhile, a selection committee of media experts rated the proposals of fact-checking organisations and recommended that the winners have nine to 12 months to complete their projects. The grants were awarded to 20 signatories of IFCNs Code of Principles and 19 non-signatories who received endorsements from active signatories to become eligible for the fund.

"Claim: A Facebook user alleged that Liberian lawmaker Moima Briggs-Mensah has called for the impeachment of Judge Nelson B. Chineh for acquitting an American missionary, Lucas Richards, at the end of a murder trial. Verdict: Misleading. DUBAWAs checks have revealed that the legislator, Briggs-Mensah, first demanded a legislative inquiry, after which a possible impeachment may kick in if the judge who acquitted the American in the attempted murder trial is found guilty of wrongdoing. A Facebook user claimed that Representative Moima Briggs-Mensah wrote to the lawmaking body to impeach the presiding judge of Criminal Court B Judge Nelson Chinned, because he acquitted an American, Lucas Richards, at the end of a murder trial. Lucas Richards was arrested and charged with the attempted murder of his Liberian wife, Jessica Lloyd, in Sept. 2023. He was arraigned before Criminal Court B presided over by Judge Nelson B. Chineh, and after nearly seven months of trial, he was found not guilty and acquitted by the judge. The Facebook user taking to his wall on Apr. 18, 2024, wrote : Breaking news! Criminal Court B Judge to be impeached! Representative Moima Briggs-Mensah has written a communication to plenary to impeach Judge Nelson B. Chineh because his recent Not-Guilty verdict in favour of American citizen Lucas Richards against a Liberian citizen, Jessica Lloyd, brought total disgrace to the entire countrys justice system. Congratulations [to a] serious lawmaker. This will serve as a deterrent to prevent reoccurrence. The piece suggested there would be an impeachment without any form of investigation. Data available on Facebook shows that the post received 351 comments, 528 likes, and 116 shares. DUBAWA decided to fact-check the post as part of its campaign against misinformation and disinformation in Liberia. Representative Briggs-Mensah has told DUBAWA that her communication with lawmakers was to call for a legislative inquiry into circumstances leading to the judges not-guilty verdict. No, the communication is to seek inquiry/investigation, she told DUBAWA when contacted. However, she said, If it is established that the process was corrupt or manipulated by bribery, we could institute an initial impeachment proceeding [into the matter]. The lawmaker maintained that: we are still investigating and encouraging people that have facts to make available those facts to ensure justice is served. Also, a Google keyword search conducted by DUBAWA into the matter showed the legislator did not call for an immediate impeachment of Judge Nelson but rather a legislative inquiry. The New Dawn Liberia reported on Apr. 19, 2024, that: Bong County District #6 Representative Moima Briggs Mensah has written to members of the House of Representatives seeking a legislative inquiry into the case involving an American missionary, Lucas Richards, and his Liberian fianc, Jessica Llyod. Speaking before the full plenary on Thursday, April 18, 2024, she told her colleagues that it was time to investigate the matter further and bring those responsible to the plenary to ask them more questions to understand what went wrong, the media organisation reported. Another media organisation, Media Talk Africa, reported on Apr. 20, 2024, A recent court ruling in Liberia has sparked outrage and calls for further investigation by lawmakers. Bong County District #6 Representative Moima Briggs Mensah has taken action, urging her colleagues in the House of Representatives to conduct a legislative inquiry into a case involving an American missionary, Lucas Richards, and his Liberian fianc, Jessica Lloyd. Also, the Monrovia-based Daily Observer reported that: The Representative of Bong County District #6, Moima Briggs Mensah, has asked the Plenary of the House of Representatives to impeach Criminal Court B Judge Nelson B. Chineh for bringing the Judiciary and the entire Government of Liberia into disrepute, following his acquittal of the American Missionary, Lucas Richards who was on trial for the attempted murder of his Liberian wife, Jessica Lloyd. DUBAWA also contacted the Director of Press and Public Affairs at the House of Representatives, Robert Haynes , who said the impeachment of Judge Nelson Chinneh is not in the jurisdiction of the House. He further provided a copy of the communication written by Representative Moima Briggs Mensah. A screenshot of the letter written by the Liberian lawmaker Briggs-Mensah DUBAWA later contacted the Facebook user about the source of the claim, but he has yet to respond to our inquiries. It is evident on the face of the letter from the House of Representatives that Representative Briggs-Mensah first called for a legislative inquiry. As a consequence, she only hinted at possible impeachment if Judge Nelson B. Chineh is found culpable for acquitting Lucas Richards, the American missionary involved in the murder trial. Therefore, the claim about calling for the impeachment of Judge Nelson B. Chiney is not true.

"Claim : a certain web-based message going round on WhatsApp claims that the Federal Government is offering N10,500 weekly as COVID-19 second wave grants. The claim going round via a web-based message that claims the Federal Government is offering N10,500 weekly as COVID-19 second wave grants is false. The spokesperson to the Federal Agency affiliated with the claim confirmed that the link is fraudulent and false. When it became evident that the only way to curtail the spread of COVID-19 was through social distancing, the need for lockdown became paramount. Though a good precautionary step towards curtailing the virus, the action came with diverse difficulties, chiefly amongst such issues meant jobs had to be worked out from home. This also implies that persons whose jobs demanded presence would have to stay idle and jobless; which meant no salaries and income for the duration of the lockdown. Courtesy of this reality, most countries supplied palliatives and cash support in order to support those whose jobs or businesses were affected by the lockdown. For fact-checkers, however, this reality came with a new challenge as multiple fraudsters capitalized on this narrative to infiltrate unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of their ruse schemes. Even worse, multiple websites that claimed to offer palliatives were confirmed by DUBAWA to be phishing sites for boosting adverts or data collecting sites for financial fraud. In Nigeria, these schemes became prevalent on the social media space, even months ago, Information circulated across social media platforms, illustrated through a link web message, claiming that Nigerias Federal Government has approved to disburse 30,000 to citizens as COVID-19 lockdown funds. Though DUBAWA had debunked the information, many people had already fallen victim to the scheme mostly for how it appeared convincing, and how wide it circulated. Courtesy of this identified avalanche of pre-existing schemes in the guise of providing COVID-19 palliative, DUBAWA subjects similar websites to scrutiny. To identify its verity, as some may not be deceitful. In this case, a certain web-based message making rounds on Whatsapp, claims that the Federal Government of Nigeria is offering N10, 500 weekly as grants for COVID-19 second wave in the country. The link has been shared and forwarded multiple times on WhatsApp and when opened at the first stage; the user is welcomed with this notice: All Nigrian Citizens are Entitled to N10,500 per week to stay at Home in a bid to control the spreed of COVID19 Second Wave, Proceed Now To Apply By Filling The Provided Form and Choose Your Preffered Payment Method, Your Account Will Be Credited As Soon As Possible. On the same page, the user is required to type in name and phone number. Designed with the emblem of the Federal Government of Nigeria and the picture of Sadiya Umar Faraouk, the minister of humanitarian affairs, disaster management, and social development, the page also contained acclaimed testimonial comments of persons who have benefited from the grants. As a procedure to access the said grant, the user is also expected to answer three questions: what is your employment status; what is your marital status and what is your age range? After answering the questions, the user is obliged to also invite friends/groups up to a certain maximum number indicated by a bar on the page before accessing the withdrawal Code. Nonetheless, as regards prior instances where DUBAWA had to verify similar claims, the case under study becomes also pertinent to be subjected to further scrutiny and analysis. To confirm the veracity of the claim, DUBAWA reached out to the Spokesperson, ministry of humanitarian affairs, disaster management, and social development via a phone call. With stern clarity, she said that the information is false and the link/website in question is fraudulent. Further advised members of the public to be wary of such websites pledging COVID-19 grants. In her actual words, the spokesperson clarified that the information is false and the link is fraudulent. I will advise members of the public to stay off such sites promising COVID-19 grants and palliatives. If the ministry will give grants, it will do so using the appropriate channel. Other red flags identified in the claim are the prevalent errors in spellings. Nigeria was misspelt as Nigrian spread was misspelt as spreed and preferred was spelt as preferred . Even more, the whole paragraph is a grammatical blunder as uppercases alphabets are assigned to words carelessly. Furthermore, even after completing the said procedure, the user is still not offered the said grants. Even more, an analysis of the link on ScamDoc reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites. The claim that the Federal Government is offering N10,500 weekly as COVID-19 second wave grants is, therefore, false, misleading, and fraudulent.",0
"Claim: X and Facebook users shared a video depicting how the federal government distributed bags of rice to protesters to stop them from further protests. Verdict: DUBAWAs findings show that the footage was taken during an Aliko Dangote Foundation-led distribution programme in April 2024. It is misleading and unrelated to the #EndBadGovernance protests. After days of demonstrations, the #EndBadGovernanceProtest appears to have started losing momentum, especially in Southwest Nigeria. Recently, a 26-second video circulated on Facebook in which X showed women carrying bags of rice. Users have claimed the food was distributed to Nigerians by the federal government so that they could stop protesting. The videos caption reads, Nigerian protesters who stormed the streets of Nigeria to protest over the high cost of living received bags of rice from the government and asked to go home and not to protest again. The clip has since gone viral on Facebook and X, gathering thousands of views, likes and reposts, as evidenced here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here, and here . DUBAWA has debunked several photos and videos shared on social media since the protest commenced on Aug. 1, 2024. Given its virality and potential for misinformation, we decided to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA scoured credible media reports to see if there was any report of the Nigerian government donating rice to its citizens since the protest started, but we found none. We took screen grabs from the footage and carried out a reverse image search. This led to an April 17, 2024, X post in which @kunmydrey , a user, accused the Yoruba people of bigotry. He shared three videos (including the circulating one) showing a crowd of women praising and praying for an unnamed benefactor as they matched with 10kg of rice on their heads. We then conducted keyword searches, which led to a report confirming that the video emanated from a flag-off ceremony for the Aliko Dangote Foundations donation of 10kg rice bags to Nigerians. In fulfilling his contribution towards alleviating food insecurity exacerbated by the countrys economic overhaul, the nonprofit organisation shared N120,000 and N80,000 bags of rice in Kano and Lagos, respectively. This development was also reported by newspapers like Premium Times , Punch , Blueprint , and Nairametrics . DUBAWAs findings revealed that the video is unconnected to the #EndBadGovernance protests. The claim is misleading.",0
"Claim : Facebook user alleged that Peter Obi announced Aisha Yesufu as his vice presidential candidate. Verdict : False. Although the origin of the video could not be traced, available videos of Peter Obis rally in Borno state do not show him naming Aisha Yesufu as his running mate. The partys spokesperson has also debunked this. Amid the campaign rallies across the country, a Facebook user Willy Ibimina Jim-George shared a short video clip with the caption, Peter Obi announces Aisha Yesufu as his vice presidential candidate. Even though the 11 seconds clip was cut short at the mention of the name Aisha, the Facebook user noted it was Aisha Yesufu, an activist who co-founded the #BringBackOurGirls movement and has been vocal about the #Obidient movement that was referenced here. Peter Obi announces Aisha Yesufu as a vice presidential candidate, part of the caption read. Another user Stanley Chinonye re-shared the same video clip posted by Ayekooto Akindele with the caption, Did you hear that Peter Obi said that his vice presidential candidate is Aisha? Recall that in July 2022, Peter Obi named Datti Baba-Ahmed, the founder of Baze University Abuja, as his running mate for the 2023 presidential election. How then will Mr Obi name Aisha Yesufu months after the window for replacing a running mate had closed and with Aisha Yesufus clear stand that she cant be Peter Obis running mate? These questions, other suspicions and the timing of this claim prompted us to verify it. Watching the 11 seconds video, these were the words we could make out: Several thousand Borno today. The vice presidential candidate Aisha. seeing there were a lot of missing contexts, we conducted a keyword search, but that did not lead to any news report on this assertion. A reverse image search was also not helpful owing to the poor quality of the video. Seeing that Peter Obi also mentioned Borno in the clip, we conducted a keyword search for videos from his rally in Borno state just to find the source of the clip. We found a nine-minute, 46 seconds video clip by Chizzy media on Youtube which didnt show any mention of Aisha as a vice presidential candidate. The only mention of Aisha was at the beginning of the video when Mr Obi was talking about security issues and the need for security personnel on the frontline of the battle to be assured their country is behind them. that is why I told Aisha that everyone around will make sure that if a policeman or soldier goes out to fight criminals, he will do so assured that the state is behind him, Mr Obi said in the video. Another one-minute 15 seconds Youtube video by TVC only showed a few seconds clip of Peter Obi speaking on nothing related to this claim. Mr Datti is still listed as Mr Obis running mate on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) website . We also contacted Akin Osuntokun, the Director General of the Labour Party president Campaign Council via calls and direct messages but didnt get a response. We subsequently reached out to the partys spokesperson, Yunusa Tanko, who debunked this. Please, this is completely fake news. We have our vice president in Datti Baba-Ahmed, his response read. Our findings do not show any video with Peter Obi naming Aisha Yesufu as his running mate, and the party has also denied the claim.",1
"Claim: Liberian men have been ranked among the top three shortest in Africa and the twenty-three-third globally. Verdict: True. Research showed that Liberian men are among the shortest globally. A 2020 medical database run by NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, a project linked to Imperial College London, backed the claim. Diamond Online, a Liberian blog on Facebook, recently amplified a report citing that Liberian men have been ranked as the top three shortest in Africa. The blog added that Liberian men also hold the top twenty-three positions of short people globally. The blog maintained that the data originates from the 2023 height database managed by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, affiliated with Imperial College London. Accordingly, it says the height of a Liberian man is 163.66cm (5 feet 4.43 inches). The Facebook post used photographs of two generations of peoplean older man and a youth, the latter of whom was Mr. Alexander Cummings , who contested the 2023 presidential elections in Liberia. Tag a KeTehKu and teh them thank you for the job well done , says Diamond Online. It remains unclear why the photographs of Mr Cummings, who is also a former Coca-Cola executive, were used to narrate the story, but Ketehku is a Liberian parlance that describes short people in the country. However, given the nature of the claim, which borders on the height of Liberian men, DUBAWA has decided to verify the claim. A 2023 study published by Business Insider on June 13, 2023 , found 25 countries with the shortest average populations. These include: 1. East Timor 2. Laos 3. Madagascar 4. Guatemala 5. Philippines 6. Nepal 7. Yemen 8. The Marshall Islands 9. Bangladesh 10 Cambodia 11. Indonesia 12. Malawi 13. Rwanda 14. India 15. Vietnam 16. Peru 17. Papua 18. Solomon Island 19. Mozambique 20. Bhutan 21. Brunei 22. Myanmar 23. Liberia 24. Honduras 25. Sri Lanka. Asia has 14 of those. The other 11 countries with the shortest populations are five in Africa, three in Central and South America, two in the Pacific, and one in the Middle East. According to the ranking, Liberia sits at 23rd globally and number 3 in Africa. The average Liberian is 159.66cm (5 feet 2.85 inches) tall. An average Liberian man is 163.66cm (5 feet 4.43 inches) tall, said the report, adding, An average Liberian woman is 155.66vm (5 feet 1.28 inches) tall. The height data compiled using the 2020 medical database run by NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, a project linked to Imperial College London, cited diet as one of the reasons for stunted growth. Further research on the average height of men on various continents showed a gap. The report was released in 2023: For instance, in Africa, the average height for a man in cm is 172; in Asia, 167.5cm; in Europe, 180cm; in North America, 175cm; in South America, 171cm; and in Australia and Oceania, 8cm. These averages, when compared to an average Liberian man, proved otherwise. Height is measured using the metric system worldwide. Still, in 2024, research indicates that three nationsLiberia, Myanmar, and the United States of America persist in their equivalence to the imperial system for such measurements. From the understanding of the information provided, it is fair to say that the claim is valid.",1
"Claim: A video shows the Emir of Qatar threatening to cut off the global natural gas supply unless Israel ends its airstrikes in Gaza. Verdict: The seven-second video is, in fact, a brief excerpt from the emirs introductory speech at the Doha Forum in 2017. The claim is false. The Israel-Hamas armed conflict is a long-standing and multifaceted struggle between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, characterised by historical, territorial, and political disputes. It has resulted in sporadic violence and enduring tensions. While Israel perceives Hamas as a security threat, Palestinians see it as a resistance movement. International efforts to reach a lasting resolution have been unsuccessful, and the conflict has had significant humanitarian consequences for both sides. The reignited tension between the two nations began on Oct. 7, 2023. Amid this conflict, which has resulted in the loss of over a thousand lives, a rumour circulated on Facebook that Qatar had announced a global gas supply halt in solidarity with the Palestinians. This claim supposedly surfaced in a video featuring Qatars Emir, Tamim Bin Hamad. It garnered significant attention, circulating widely and appearing on multiple platforms . Given the sensitivity of the issue and its widespread dissemination, DUBAWA opted to verify the credibility of this assertion. Qatar ranks among the worlds leading natural gas producers, and typically, an event of this nature would be a subject of national discussion. We examined various mainstream media outlets but could not locate any relevant news. We then conducted a reverse image search on a keyframe of the viral video. This brought us to Mr Hamads opening speech at the Doha Forum in 2017, during which he discussed the Palestinian refugee crisis but did not make the statement that had been circulating. Likewise, in an email to AP News, The Qatar government verified that the video is from 2017 and was misrepresented. This is yet another case of online disinformation against Qatar such a statement has never been made and never would be, it wrote. Not only was this video used out of context, it is just a snippet from Mr Hamads introductory speech at the 2017 Doha Forum. The claim is false.",0
"Claim: All Countries that passed the MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of dollars, except Liberia. Verdict: False! Liberia is not the only country that failed to receive a grant from MCC after passing its scorecards. A staunch critic of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) government under the leadership of President George Weah has claimed that all countries that passed the just released MCC scorecard received hundreds of millions of United States dollars except Liberia. According to Henry Costa, Liberia missed out on the MCC grant due to the poor leadership credentials of President George Weah. He made the claim when he appeared on a local radio talk show, the OKay Morning Rush, aired on Okay 99.5FM upon returning to the country. The show, which was carried live on the stations official Facebook page, had 1.2k comments, 17.1k viewers and over 550 emojis. The assertion was made at 51:34-47 seconds within the over one-hour show on Tuesday, January 3, 2023. Since the issue of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has become a talking point for Liberians, especially after the first and highest pass made by the Liberian government under the Weah-led regime, DUBAWA decided to subject the claim by Henry Costa to scrutiny. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an innovative and independent U.S. foreign assistance agency that is helping lead the fight against global poverty. The MCC was created by the U.S. Congress in January 2004 with strong bipartisan support and has changed the conversation on how best to deliver smart U.S. foreign assistance by focusing on good policies, country ownership, and results. MCC provides time-limited grants by promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and strengthening institutions of countries that are deemed to have passed the MCC scorecards. Liberia joined the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in 2006 under President Ellen Johnson Sirleafs leadership; since then, the country has been a part of the program. Under the presidency of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Liberia passed the scorecards on two occasions, in 2013 and 2017 . Here are the 12-year scorecards of Liberia under President Sirleaf. After passing the MCC in 2013, the Government of Liberia and the United States Government, through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Liberia in October 2015, signed a US$257million compact with a direct focus on rebuilding the countrys broken electricity sector and the construction of a new 48-inch diameter Raw Water Pipeline between Mt. Coffee and the White Plains Water Treatment Plant to replace a damaged 36-inch diameter pipeline that had not been in use since Liberias civil war. The benefits from this compact ended on January 20, 2021. Under the George Weah-led administration, the Liberian government in 2022/2023 passed 12 out of 20 indicators of the MCC scorecard. This pass received massive media reports through the instrumentality of the government of Liberia, as seen here and here . Though Liberia is part of the countries that passed the recently released scorecard of the MCC, Liberia is not among the countries eligible to benefit from the grant. One hundred countries passed the 2022/2023 MCC scorecard . Out of this number, only 62 countries were eligible for the grant under the low-income category, while under the lower middle-income category, four countries were eligible for the grants: Algeria, Eswatini, Indonesia and Samoa. Even though 62 countries have been deemed eligible, only a few were announced as grant beneficiaries. In a December 14, 2022, statement issued by United States President Joseph Biden on behalf of the MCCs Board, $1.2 billion was announced for grant beneficiaries. Liberia was omitted from the list of beneficiaries, and so were other countries. Biden said in connection with the announcement of grants, Along with selecting countries for new grant programs, MCCs Board also reselected Cte dIvoire as eligible for a concurrent regional compact program; Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Zambia for compact development; and Kiribati for threshold program development. The Board also reaffirmed its support for continuing compact development in Belize. MCC regularly reviews its partner countries policy performance throughout developing and implementing a compact or threshold program. Per this statement, Liberia was not the only country left out of receiving the grant from the MCC. Countries like Nigeria, Somalia, Malawi, Lesotho, Ghana, Cape Verde and many others were not selected, even though all of them were eligible. Still unsatisfied with the statement, DUBAWA reached out to the head of the MCC-Liberia compact, Mr Monie R. Captan, to find out why Liberia was omitted. Mr Monie R. Captan told DUBAWA in a WhatsApp conversation that when a country becomes eligible, it does not mean it will be selected automatically, adding that there are limited funds and selection is competitive among those deemed to be eligible. Mr Captain further stated, the selection is not every year, so it is possible we might get selected next year. Each compact has a separate project. The last compact had to do with energy, and the compact closed in 2021 when we completed the project. Based on all of the research conducted by DUBAWA with evidence from the Millennium Challenge Corporation official site, it is safe to say that the claim made by Henry Costa that Liberia is the only country that did not receive an MCC grant after passing its scorecard is false.",1
"Claim: Video and audio have surfaced about students fleeing for the fear of the COVID-19 Vaccine in Lagos. The video is 2 years old and is linked to an incident in Port-Harcourt when a secondary school student detonated tear-gas. It has nothing to do with COVID-19. On Wednesday, 3rd February 2021, a short video surfaced online, accompanied by a voice note. The video showed a pandemonium; students running out of their classrooms, jumping from the storey building and fleeing the school premises. The voice behind the camera was only screaming Jesus in the 28seconds-long video. The video was accompanied by a voice note in Hausa. The voice note claimed that the students are running for the fear of being injected with the COVID19 Vaccine. They are running because the COVID19 Vaccine injection is to be tested on them, he said, before continuing that The Britons who created the COVID19 Vaccine tested it on 1,000 people, 600 died. So they decided to test it on Black people, thats why they are in Lagos, he said. With WhatsApp being a private platform, it is impossible to get the number of views or reach the video and voice note have attained. However, a forwarded label created by WhatsApp was stamped on the video and audio, which showed that the sender himself did not create it. He/she received it and forwarded it. With WhatsApp widely regarded as the abode of fake news, this message has the potential of already spreading farther than we can imagine. A Quick Search using InVid Verification tool, pointed us to the full Video on You T ube , posted on May 27th, 2019 and Facebook posted on May 25th, 2019. Both Videos, 1:43seconds-long and 1:00minutes-long on YouTube and Facebook respectively, have the same caption, albeit constructed in different ways. The captions revealed that a secondary school student brought tear-gas to school, which was detonated, causing the pandemonium. An SS2 boy in Port Harcourt brought a teargas gun and dynamite to fight SS3 students the caption on YouTube states, while the one posted on Facebook reads An SS2 student of CSS secondary sch. Oroworokwu, port Harcourt, on the 24th of May, brought guns and grenade teargas for a class fight between SS2 students and SS3 students. Why showing it off to his classmates, he unknowingly detonated one of the grenade teargas, And all Hell broke loose!! Another search of the school where the incident was said to have happened, CSS Secondary School, Oroworokwu, Port Harcourt, River State, also pointed to several media reports , confirming the incident. On the 25th May, 2019, PMNews posted the same video on its website with the headline, Incredible video: Pandemonium in Rivers School as student detonates teargas in class . The story was also featured on the Leadership newspaper here , and on the BBC Pidgin, here . A few days later, Rivers State Government launched a probe into the matter, as reported by the Leadership Newspaper. Several criticisms and conspiracy theories have trailed the announcement of the development of the COVID19 Vaccine in various countries, and especially when the Nigerian Government disclosed plans to get and vaccinate Nigerians. At the onset of the COVID-19s spread, there were conspiracy theories linking the virus to the 5G Technology, a claim severally debunked . False. The Claim that the students are running from the fear of being injected with a COVID-19 Vaccine is false. The said Video is two years old, and its a video depicting a tear-gas detonation in May, 2019, in Port-Harcourt, Rivers State, Nigeria.

"Get access to Federal Governments FREE N50,000 monthly allowance for Nigerians. This scheme is geared towards reducing poverty in the country. Apply Now, reads a post on Facebook. The post features a graphic with the logo of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), a photo of the banks governor Olayemi Cardoso and the text: Federal government approved.

The poster replied with the same text to all, saying: Please note that it's a government approved and not a scam.i be sending you to the help center ok. Nigeria is facing its worst economic crisis in decades, leaving citizens unhappy with the rising cost of living.

We found similar posts here , here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But is the government giving out a FREE N50,000 monthly allowance? We checked. Beware of scams We searched Google, using keywords from the claim, and found no media reports on it. A N50,000 allowance from the government would make headlines as it would help put food on the table for many struggling families. We also checked the CBNs website and social media platforms for such an announcement but came up empty. It's also suspicious that the posts are poorly written and lack detail. We would expect any communication from the government to be well written and give enough details, such as where to apply and who qualifies for the allowance.

"Claim: A Facebook post claimed that Hollywood actor Sylvester Stallone is dead. Verdict: False! Our findings show that this is not the first time the actor has been rumoured to be dead. So far, media outlets have dismissed claims of his death, and there has been no recent announcement of his alleged demise. Moreover, activities on his Instagram account do not suggest the actor is dead. A Facebook user, Ye Maung , shared a post suggesting that Hollywood actor and filmmaker Sylvester Stallone has been confirmed dead. The Facebook user, in a post shared on Friday, Dec. 20, 2024, wrote, 09:09:35 Hollywood announced about the Legendary actor Sylvester Stallone, He has been confirmed as Read more. The caption of this post was incomplete, with a read-more that led nowhere. Although this didnt outrightly state the actor is dead, the image of the actor and other accompanying images suggests he is dead. As of Sunday, Dec. 29, 2024, it has gained two comments and one repost. DUBAWA decided to verify the post due to the posts sensitivity and the personality involved. A Google keyword search on the veracity of the incident led us to multiple disclaimer reports published in July 2024, when the news of the alleged death of the Rambo actor went viral. TheDirect debunked the actors death on July 25, 2024, described the rumour as unsubstantiated, and stated there had been no official announcement of Sylvesters death. On July 26, 2024, Yentertainment published a disclaimer dismissing the Expendables actors death as false. The Hollywood stars official Instagram handle does not show any announcement of his death. His last post, made on Dec. 26, 2024, six days after the claim, suggests that the actor is still alive as his account is still active. As of the time of filing this report, there is no official report of the actors death by any credible media outlet. Findings reveal that the Hollywood actor is not dead, contrary to the Facebook users claim.",0
"Claim: A Twitter user claims youth in Adamawa State burnt brooms to show their support for Atiku Abubakar. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken during Bugum Chugu, a fire festival that takes place in Ghana. It is neither related to Nigeria, nor has anything to do with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate. As the 2023 presidential election draws near, the Nigerian social media landscape has been awash with discussions around the major contending candidates. Recently, some social media users began to circulate a TikTok video suggesting that the youths of Adamawa State are out to show their support for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. Millions of youths burning brooms in Adamawa after receiving Atiku yesterday, well, this is just the beginning. 2023 is going to be mad. #AtikuKawai, one of the tweets reads. The video shows a crowd, matching on the street with fire sticks in their hands as loud music blasts in the background. The video has confused social media users. While some believed it was Adamawa youth burning brooms in support of the PDP presidential candidate, others claimed that the video was from Ghana. Therefore, DUBAWA opted to verify the accuracy of the video. After close observation of the video, DUBAWA found two overlapping usernames. Although blurry, they were two different user identities. TikTok is known for automatically attaching its users names to their videos. However, the original version of a TikTok video is not supposed to have more than one username, indicating a form of manipulation on the video. When DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on TikTok, similar videos shared by other users were uncovered. The earliest version of the footage revealed it was taken during a Ghanaian festival that took place on the 9th of August, 2022. This is contrary to the circulating version. In the original version, emphasis was the cheers of the crowd in the background and not music. Also, the people were waving a bunch of thatch lighted with fire and not brooms as claimed. The Bugum Chugu Fire Festival is an annual event that takes place in the Northern region of Ghana. The occasion is marked by the lighting of thatch torches, matching along approved routes, chanting war songs. The event is marked to celebrate the beginning of a new year in the traditional month of Bugum Gri, known among the Dagomba people as im. According to legend , the people upheld this event many years ago, after a missing son of their king was found asleep under a tree. Our discovery shows that the circulating video emanated from an annual fire festival that took place in the Northern region of Ghana. It is not related to Nigeria or the PDP presidential candidate. The claim accompanying the video is false.",1
"Claim : Hope TV-Liberia in CDC-TV NEWS (a Facebook group) alleged that a man in Bong County cut his wifes hand for LD$3500. Verdict : False! Bong County Police Superintendent Fasu Sheriff told DUBAWA that no such case has come to the knowledge of the Police in Bong. Also, Reverse Image Search shows that the incident took place in Jos, Nigeria, where a man chopped off his wifes hand for N3000. An online Television, Hope TV-Liberia shared a post in CDC-TV NEWS Facebook group that a man in Bong County (central region of Liberia) cut the hand of his wife for the amount of LD$3500. The post didnt mention the location of the incident in Bong, nor gave the particulars of the accused person. Bong County, a man allegedly cut off his wifes hand because of LD$3500, the post said. A screenshot of the post. The post generated 39 reactions and 33 comments at the time of this writing. In the comment section, people considered the act cruel and called for justice to prevail. However, DUBAWA felt suspicious about the report and decided to investigate. DUBAWA contacted the Police Commander of Bong to inquire about the incident in the area. According to Police Superintendent Fasu Sheriff, the case has not come to the attention of the Police, but they are investigating the allegation. It is not to my knowledge. I have called my deputies in the various depots but they have not confirmed such a case. We are not aware but we are still investigating, Col. Fasu Sheriff, Bong Police Superintendent. Also, a Google Reverse Image Search of the image revealed that it emanated from Nigeria. A Nigerian News Agency, Torizone published an article on the issue on April 30, 2024. According to the article, the incident occurred in Jos, Nigeria. It stated that the accused chopped off his wifes hand because of N3000 she took from his savings. The incident was also reported on Instagram by Tobeblogofficial . DUBAWAs findings revealed that the incident did not happen in Bong but in Nigeria. The claim, therefore, is false.",1
"CLAIM: An X user, Sonia (unahsonia) , shared some pictures of a burnt vehicle and claimed that it was the result of electoral violence sponsored by the Imo state governor, Hope Uzodinma. FINDINGS: We ran a reverse image search on both pictures and discovered the incident is not recent. It happened around 8 am on Oct. 2, 2023, at Ezzangbo junction along Abakaliki Enugu highway, Ohanukwu LGA, Ebonyi state. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: Google Lens DATE: 11/11/2023 FACT-CHECK AUTHOR: Phillip Anjorin EDITORS: Simbiat Bakare & Bamas Victoria",1
"Claim: A viral video claimed that Vincent Dabilgou, former Minister of Transportation in Burkina Faso, was stripped and beaten in public by a mob for acts of corruption. Verdict: False. While DUBAWA could not ascertain the identity of the person in the video, he still does not share facial semblance with Dabilgou. Also, a journalist confirmed that the person in the video is not the former Minister neither did it occur in Burkina Faso. Corruption and embezzlement of public funds are threats to democracy in Africa and are mostly the basis for most military takeovers on the continent. Sometimes, deposed politicians are made to go through public humiliation or execution. Even though public humiliation of government officials is rare and against the law, there has been a wide call for it to be adopted in Africa, just like in China , to deter officials from embezzling public funds. It is no surprise that a video has gone viral on social media claiming that a former Minister of Transport in Burkina Faso, Vincent Dabilgou, was stripped and flogged in public after a court found him guilty of embezzling public funds while in office. The video was widely spread across social media platforms here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . Reno Omokri, @renoomokri posted the video to his 2.5 million followers, saying, Grace To Grass: The Barbaric Treatment Burkina Faso Meted To Vincent Dabilgou, Its Former Transport Minister, he captioned the post. The video, posted on June 8, 2024, had 212,400 views, 304 comments, 311 retweets, and 666 likes. Commenting on the tweet, @nazirgaladanchi, said the treatment in Nigeria should be used to assess public officeholders. Similarly, King Jorge ( @GeorgeO85057554) stated that such an act should be meted out to every government official in Kenya, starting from the top echelon. Another commenter, Attah Timothy Bash ( @attah_bash ), said he once witnessed how a person who committed theft was beaten to a pulp. Thus, he wished the same punishment could be given to those who steal with pens. DUBAWA decided to investigate this claim because of its potential to misinform the public. In investigating the claim, DUBAWA observed a comment under @StreetSoccerIn2 s tweet that claimed the person in the video is not Mr Dabilgou but a Burkinabe business mogul, Apollinaire Compaor . A tweet on X also supported the claim that it was Compaore. Also, DUBAWA conducted a Google Image Reverse Search using keyframes of the video obtained from InVID WeVerify. Findings indicated that the video was first posted on an Instagram account, Congolese Visibility Report ( @congolese_visibility_repost_ ), on May 29, 2024. The video was captioned in French. Google Translate showed the caption, This is how we must start treating the leaders of this country after stealing state money, as is happening now in Burkina Faso, the country of honest men. It was later posted on X by @X_Daily on June 6, 2024, with a different caption that the person was a former minister without stating his portfolio. It stated that the minister was forced to show the location of his booty after admitting he embezzled some government funds. The victim expressed his readiness to exchange the money for his life. It was not until June 8 that the video started appearing with captions mentioning Vincent Dabilgou: here , here , and here . The caption said Dabilgou was sent to the public to be beaten thoroughly after he was allegedly found guilty of embezzling 1.7 million and later sentenced to 11 years in prison. In the two posting trends, there was an element of copy-and-paste in the dissemination of the video. Also, keen observation on his official Facebook page showed that Mr Dabilgous last post was on January 10, 2023. However, a search on the page showed that his pictures did not match those of the man in the video. The man in the video has rotund physical features, while Dabligou is a lanky fellow. Similarly, Dabilgou has a scar on his forehead, but no such scar is visible on the face of the man in the video. In addition, DUBAWA observed that the man in the video is bald, while images of Vincent Dabilgou online showed him not to be bald. On the claim that the man in the video is Apollinaire Compaor , while it is observed that they both share some similarities in physical features, like baldness and rotund shape, it could not be ascertained that they are the same person as their faces look different. Also, DUBAWA keenly observed that Apollinaire Compaore looked older than the man in the viral video. Also, a Google search using the keyword former minister flogged in Burkina Faso did not show news from any credible media organisation on the alleged beating of Dabilgou. This is in contrast to his conviction, which was widely published by mainstream news organisations. A Google Search with the keyword Vincent Dabilgou jailed brought up news reports stating that a high court sentenced the former minister to 11 years in prison. A report by Africa News quoted AFP that Dabilgou, who served as minister from 2018 to 2022 under the presidency of Roch Marc Christian Kabor before he was overthrown in January 2022, was charged with embezzlement of public funds, illicit enrichment, and money laundering. The report said the court found him guilty of embezzling 1.12 billion FCFA (around 1.7 million euros) on Aug. 17, 2023. Mr Dabilogou was convicted in August 2023, whereas the viral video surfaced online in May 2024. This suggests that Mr Dabilogou was in prison before the video appeared online. In addition, DUBAWA contacted Diakaridia Siribi, a journalist with Le Sidwaya, a daily newspaper in Burkina Faso. He confirmed that the victim in the video is not the former minister of transport for Burkina Faso. The Borrreaux accent and the victim are not from Burkina, but rather Ivoirien, he said. He added that he was shocked by how the video was framed as a Burkinabe video. DUBAWA contacted the Embassy of Burkina Faso in Ghana to ascertain if the man in the video was a former minister. But, as of the filing of this report, there was no feedback. A thorough analysis and detailed observation show that the man beaten in the video is not Vincent Dabilgou.",0
"Claim: A Twitter user shared a video capturing a crowd allegedly fleeing from their homes in Zurmi Local Government Area (LGA) of Zamfara state. Verdict: Misleading. It is an old video, and it did not happen in Nigeria. In recent days, a video depicting a significant exodus of people from a particular area has been widely circulated across various social media platforms. On May 16, 2024, a Twitter user identified as Erimus ( @FirstObidient ) shared a video capturing a crowd alleging that they fled from their homes in Zurmi Local Government Area (LGA) of Zamfara state. Accompanying the 29-second video was a caption expressing concern over the lack of response from the Governor and the Presidency in the wake of the crisis. The caption reads, BREAKING: Families fleeing from their homes in Zurmi LGA of Zamfara state after terrorists raided their communities and kidnapped over 500 people. So far, theres been no word from the Governor or the Presidency. At the time of reporting, the video had garnered significant attention, amassing over 75,000 views and eliciting 615 comments across various platforms. Among the reactions, Stride Networks ( @NetworksStride) questioned the authenticity of the situation depicted in the video. The X user wrote, So these people are fleeing abi so if you are running away from danger this is the way you would walk abi, keep on it while others, such as Viva XY ( @VivaDido), criticised the governments perceived failure to address the ongoing security challenges, Failed government. Failed system. Another user, AAW.(@vicayz) AAW . (raised doubts about the location of the incident, prompting further discussions among viewers. The X user wrote, There is nothing in the video that suggests it is Nigeria. Abi I dey miss something nee. Similarly, Serah Ibrahim ( @TheSerahIbrahim) shared a 13-second version of the video, emphasising the magnitude of the abduction, with over 500 individuals reportedly taken captive. The accompanying caption reiterated the absence of official statements from local and federal authorities, underscoring the situations urgency. The caption reads, BREAKING: Not 1, Not 2,Not 50 But 500. 500 people have been kidnapped in Zurmi LGA, Zamfara State. And not a single word from the Governor or the Presidency. Families around that region can be seen migrating to unknown destinations to run away from the attackers. At the time of filing this report, the extended video had amassed over 498,000 views and garnered significant engagement, highlighting the widespread concern and demand for action in response to the escalating crisis in Zamfara State. DUBAWA searched the internet using keywords related to Zamfara and security, but there were no results. Further, we deployed the InVID plugin , a video verification tool, and discovered that the video in question is old footage that has been trending since 2021 and the incident did not happen in Nigeria. Investigation revealed that the video was initially filmed during an attack on the village of Solhan in Burkina Faso in 2021, where civilians were massacred and residents displaced by gunmen. It was found that the clip had been repeatedly used to spread misinformation across Africa, particularly in regions grappling with ethnic conflicts. The video was initially published on Facebook on June 8, 2021, by SAIDA International e.V, a German charity organisation. The accompanying post, written in German, included the hashtag #solhan and translated to English as: On the run in their own country: As if the people in Burkina Faso, one of the poorest countries in the world, did not have enough already. The Facebook post also coincides with an Al Jazeera report that more than 7,000 families had fled Solhan, a village in northern Burkina Faso, following a tragic massacre, marking one of the bloodiest incidents in a six-year jihadist insurgency in the region. Additionally, Burkinabe online media outlet Lobs Paalga uploaded a longer version of the footage on YouTube on the same day. The videos authenticity has previously been scrutinised by fact-checking entities including DUBAWA , AFP , and The Cable , dating back to 2021. The viral video purportedly depicting people fleeing from Zamfara, Nigeria, is an old footage from Burkina Faso. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Crest 91.1FM, Ibadan, and News Verifier Africa, to enrich the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: A Public Notice in circulation claims that fuel pump prices have been increased with immediate effect by the government. The Executive Chairman of the Petroleum Regulatory Agency, Brima M Baluwa Koroma, says the public notice claiming that the government has increased fuel pump prices is false. He said although it is imminent, prices have not been increased. A Public Notice has been circulating on social media platforms, especially WhatsApp and Facebook that the Petroleum Regulatory Agency , Ministry of Finance , Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Oil Marketing Companies have increased fuel pump prices with immediate effect. With immediate effect Petrol, Diesel, Kerosene and Fuel Oil move from Le 8,500 to Le10,000 per litre. It also furthered that, all Oil Marketing Companies (OMC) and fuel dealers nationwide are urged to adhere to the above pump price adjustments. It continued that the government and OMCs have agreed to reform the downstream petroleum sector in a transparent way of adjusting fuel pump prices that seek the interest of the general public, the notice stated. Dubawa monitored and did several checks on the various governments websites and social media platforms including the Petroleum Regulatory Agency , Ministry of Finance , Ministry of Trade and Industry Facebook pages, but all debunked the claim. Also the Executive Chairman of the Petroleum Regulatory, Agency Brima M Baluwa Koroma, was on one Radio Democracy on the 22nd of June to debunk the notice saying, prices have not been increased even though it is imminent. Sierra Leone does not determine its oil or pump prices as the prices of petroleum products are determined by a combination of the international Oil reference price (PLATTS) and the foreign exchange rate, Mr Koroma added From the analysis and investigations relating to the claim in the public notice, it is clear that the notice is false. Even if there might be an increase in the prices of fuel, it is yet to be effected. The researcher produced this fact-check per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship partnership with Afriradio to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: According to a viral WhatsApp message, the COVID-19 vaccine shortens your life span and leads to impotency This claim is false and misleading as Dubawa could not find anywhere the professor made this claim. Also, the WHO, several studies and reports do not agree with this claim. As vaccine rollout continues, we have seen an increasing spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation, including claims that the vaccine has been weaponised to depopulate the world . Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims that the vaccine reduces the lifespan of as many that took the vaccine. For people below 50 years of age, they are expected to die within 5-10 years while those above 70 will die within 2-3 years. The message which was attributed to one professor Dolores Cahill also claims the vaccine makes people impotent. anyone who got the vaccine will be dead within 5-10 years time. If you are over 70years old and got the vaccine, -you will be dead within 2-3 years time. But most importantly you become impotent first. Excerpt of the WhatsApp message. Dubawa researched the professor and also conducted a keyword search on the claim. Doctor Dolores Cahill up until March 18, 2021, was a University College Dublin (UCD) professor , who chaired the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, before her resignation on March 22, 2021. Her incessant online claims around COVID-19 led to a request for her to resign from a leading European Unions scientific committee and her removal from her lecturing role. DUBAWAs keyword search did not yield any useful result as we could not find the WhatsApp claim anywhere online outside WhatsApp. We, however, saw other claims made by the professor. Dr Cahill who was the Professor of Translational Science at the UCD School of Medicine has been one of the leading advocates against lockdown and mask-wearing during the Covid-19 pandemic. She once said that children who wore face masks were being starved of oxygen and would have lower IQ. She also claimed that Lockdown and social distancing are not needed to stop the spread of the virus, as people who recover are immune for life after 10 days. She also said death and illnesses can be prevented by extra vitamins like vitamins C, D and zinc. Opposing vaccinations, she also said politicians and the media are using COVID-19 as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people to make them sicker and to force vaccinations on them. These claims have, however, been fact-checked by the journal which showed they are false and misleading. The European Commission in response to these claims said her claims could cause significant harm if taken literally. Her former institution UCD has also disassociated itself from her comments. DUBAWA reached out to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which noted that Dr Cahills claim is false, as available COVID-19 vaccines have been assessed for safety and have also been found not to interfere with the human Deoxyribonucleic (DNA). There is no evidence of this. COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, save lives and prevent serious illness from COVID-19. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades, including in the contexts of Zika, rabies, and influenza vaccines. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. Excerpt of WHOs comment. The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine makes one impotent is false as the possibility of impotency has been discussed only in association with the virus, not the vaccine. A 2020 study has suggested COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues; however, the study noted that evidence from diagnostic procedures, such as penile color-doppler ultrasound and hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis evaluation is necessary to assess the extent to which COVID-19 has been able to impair erectile, and finally vascular, function. Relatedly, vaccination and adhering to recommended COVID-19 guidelines have been advised to avoid any possible side effect associated with COVID-19. Also, DUBAWA s explainer throws more light on the COVID-19 vaccine and fertility issues for both men and women. This article shows fertility of men and women is not affected by COVID-19 vaccines. While studies on the virus continue, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that none of the vaccines rolled out so far has been found to make men or women infertile. The claim attributed to Professor Cahill is false and misleading as Dubawa could not find anywhere the professor made this claim. In addition, the WHO, and other studies and reports do not agree with this claim. Even if the claim was made by the professor, her reputation with propagating a number of strongly rejected claims about COVID-19 questions her credibility and makes COVID-19 information from her not trustworthy.",0
"Claim: Different Facebook accounts shared a picture of a tarred road and claimed it was from Gembu town in Taraba state, Nigeria. Verdict: FALSE. Findings revealed that the path is named West End Highway at Kangaroo Island, an Australian tourist attraction. Good road construction is one of the first indicators of a modernised community. In 2023, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ranked Nigeria as the sixth African country with the worst road infrastructure. With only 37% tarred out of about 200,000 km covering a 923,768 km land mass, Nigeria barely fared better than Rwanda, Guinea, Burundi, Madagascar, and The Gambia. Amidst the reality of a deplorable road infrastructure in the country, it was surprising when a picture of a tarred road spanning a distance started trending on social media. We first found the picture on X when a user named Typical African (@Joe_Bassey) shared it on Apr. 13, 2024, claiming that it was a road in Gembu at Taraba state, Nigeria. As of Apr. 16, 2024, the post had gained about 2701 reactions, 348 reposts and 121 bookmarks from more than 58,900 views. On Facebook, we found the claim here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . The virality of the claim made us fact-check the image. DUBAWA conducted a Reverse Image Search using Google Lens. We discovered that the original picture was taken at Kangaroo Island, a tourist attraction site in Australia. We found a website dedicated to providing tour guides with navigation on the island. Fortunately, the road was the featured image on the website. To find the precise path in the viral picture, we compared the tour sketch on the website with the image and established a similar pattern between the image and the path leading out of Flinders Chase National Park on the island. With this fact in hand, we conducted a street-view analysis using Google Earth. The path we found was named West End Highway. None of this information pointed to Nigeria or bore any similarity with anywhere in Taraba state. Our findings show the viral image is from Kangaroo Island in Australia, not Gembu in Taraba state. Therefore, the claim is false.",0
"""WELCOME TO ZOOMLIFESTYLE Everyday is Winning day once you are okoye Peter fans,"" reads a post on the Facebook page zoom winners . On 11 June 2023, the post asked Nigerians to hurry up and purchase their zoom tickets. It said: ""Click on the link below to make your registration your self through the website."" The post features a video of Peter Okoye , the Nigerian musician also known as Mr P, talking to one of the winners from his privately owned lottery platform Zoom Lifestyle . Okoye and his twin brother, Paul, are also in the singing duo P-Square . The post includes a WhatsApp link and the video has been viewed over 450 times. To entice users, some of the comments on the post are made by accounts posting similar schemes on their pages. We also found similar posts here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . But is the page zoom winners and its posts really affiliated with Okoyes lottery? Zoom Lifestyle is a lottery platform owned by Okoye. It gives away millions of naira in cash, as well as prizes such as concert tickets and business mentorship. The Zoom Lifestyle website explains how to enter the lottery, either by using a particular code if youre an MTN, 9Mobile or Airtel cellular customer or by registering on the website. On 15 November 2022, the official Facebook page for the platform warned users not to fall for scams using Okoyes name and old videos. It posted: Zoomlifestyle is not an investment company but a lottery company; we do not have any manager, and Zoomlifestyle is not on WhatsApp. All tickets are purchased directly from our website at www.zoomlifestyle.com and not by making payment into any personal account. @peterpsquare no longer call winners via video calls as a result of the increase in the rate of scammers using his previous videos/pictures to deceive people. The official Facebook page has over 50,000 followers. The page zoom winners has only three, and other pages similar to it have no followers at all or less than 50 followers. Okoye was the face of the platform until July 2022 when he announced he was resigning from anchoring or presenting because of fraudsters. He lamented how some Facebook accounts were using old videos of him in order to defraud Nigerians. Scammers were arrested in Lagos in April 2023 for defrauding a woman of N1,500,000 by impersonating Okoye. The fact-checking organisation Dubawa reported how fraudsters had duped Nigerians using Facebook and WhatsApp. The popular musician said in an 11 June 2023 post that he didnt own or have any GIVEAWAY platform and had no WhatsApp number. He warned his followers to be careful of those impersonating him on Facebook: ""So many fake pages here on Facebook pretending to be me! They will Scam you oh! #ScamAlert"" In another post , he said Zoom Lifestyle was not an investment platform, but a lottery company. Africa Check has exposed several Facebook accounts falsely claiming to offer money-making opportunities to Nigerians. This is, like them, a scam.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed, Over four (4) persons are dead now, at the White Tuesday protest. Verdict: Misleading. The spokesperson of the Liberia National Police said no life was lost during the protest. Hundreds of Liberians, under the banner Concerned Citizens for the Protection of our Constitution, Democracy, and the Rule of Law, assembled in Monrovia on December 17, 2024, for a mass protest. The gathering tagged White Tuesday was not without the throwing of stones by protesters and the spraying of teargas by the Liberia National Police (LNP). A Facebook user named Emmanuel Tosiah took to Facebook and shared a post saying over four (4) persons are dead now at the protest. As of this report, the post had attracted some engagement, with some commenters sceptical aboutas to whether Tosiahs information was correct. DUBAWA contacted the LNP spokesperson, Cecelia Clarke , but she debunked the information, describing it as false. According to Clarke, that information is false. No life was lost. That is misinformation right over there. Also, DUBAWA contacted Emmanuel Tosiah through a Messenger chat to provide the source of his information. He responded, Some of our colleagues were arrested and taken to an unknown destination, and the numbers are around four (4). Their phones [are] off. When asked whether he could confirm if they were indeed dead, Tosiah is yet to respond. DUBAWA tried a Google search to see if there had been any media report about recorded deaths but found no such report from the media. Emmanuel Tosiahs post that over four people died at the White Tuesday protest is false.",0
"Claim: Social media users recently shared a video claiming it was from the scene of the fire incident in Niger state. Verdict: False! The video is not related to the Niger fire incident. It has been circulating online since Dec. 25, 2024. A male voice in the video confirmed that the tanker was carrying groundnut oil, not petrol. Misinformation is likely to thrive during a natural or human-made disaster. In the past week, DUBAWA fact-checked some videos that flooded social media amid the California wildfires. The dust around the California wildfires had barely settled when a tragic incident at Dikko Junction in Gurara Local Government Area of Niger state shook Nigeria, Africas most populous nation. On Jan. 18, 2025, a petrol tanker reportedly crashed, spilling its contents onto the road. A fire was ignited as some residents and passers-by attempted to retrieve the spilt fuel. The incident has tragically resulted in multiple fatalities, with several others injured. As of the time of this report, over 90 people have been confirmed dead, while the state government and relevant stakeholders are intensifying efforts to ensure the survivors get adequate treatment at hospitals. Discussions about the tanker explosion have taken centre stage on social media recently, with many Nigerians lamenting similar incidents in other parts of the country last year. Citizens are stressing the urgent need for government action to prevent a recurrence. Amid the ongoing buzz around the incident, social media users have circulated visuals supposedly from the tanker explosion scene with various narratives. Among the viral videos, one claimed to have been captured at the Dikko junction a few minutes before the fire broke out. Considering the interest in the topic, DUBAWA decided to subject the viral clip to scrutiny. We traced the circulating video to a TikTok account with the name Abdul Chiroma, who posted it a few weeks earlier, on Dec. 25, 2024. The video showed some people scampering about to scoop the liquid contents of a truck. However, a male voice could be heard in the video speaking in Hausa. DUBAWA engaged Hausa translators who provided context into what transpired in the video. In the video, the male voice also spoke about a collapsed truck loaded with red oil. The voice started with Assalamu alaikum an Islamic greeting. See, a truckload of oil has poured on the road, and people are busy scooping groundnut oil. May Allah bless the owner. People are busy stealing vegetable oil from the truck. The video is not connected to the Niger State incident. It was first uploaded online on Dec 25, 2024, while the Niger tanker explosion happened on Jan 18, 2025. Therefore, the claim is false!",0
"Claim: An X user claims Manchester United has offered Pogba a 50k weekly wage, including bonuses, in a short-term deal. Verdict: False. No reliable news outlets or Manchester United have confirmed the claimants alleged development. Besides, recent reports linked to the former French player have only speculated that he could play in MLS in the United States before joining any top-flight European outfit later in the summer. The 2018 World Cup winner Paul Pogba is expected to have fully served his two-year football ban by March 2025 after he was found guilty of taking dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in 2023. The Frenchman was initially handed a four-year suspension, but it was reduced by half after a partially successful appeal in November 2024. Consequently, he is free to join any club of interest after mutually terminating the contract with the Italian side, Juventus , on Nov. 30, 2024. Against this backdrop, an X user, Manutd Addicts ( @Manutd_addicts ), claimed that Premier League side Manchester United had offered the former Juventus and United midfielder a new contract in a short-term deal that includes a 50000 weekly salary and other add-ons. BREAKING: Manchester offer Pogba short term deal worth 50k a week plus bonuses, wrote the X user. This claim was made when some key Red Devils were afflicted with injuries. These injuries have failed to improve the team from its dismal 15th position on the league table and risk a first-time relegation . The claim was also found on Facebook and Threads . As of Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, the X post had generated 385000 views, 177 comments, 298 retweets, 6,400 likes, and 84 bookmarks. Surely, the post attracted several comments, including anxious and doubtful comments. Are we that desperate, offering Pogba 50k a week after he tanked our dressing room, cost us millions, and hasnt kicked a ball in two years? ( @reddevilrooney ) reacted. Given our condition, this is so expensive, ( @Anuj__31 ) stated. Who is your source Walt Disney? ( @rpj1354 ) queried. Due to the nature of the claim, its virality, and the diverse reactions to it, DUBAWA decided to verify its authenticity. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search for the claim but did not find any media reports about it. Moreover, we viewed Uniteds website for an official statement concerning the assertion but found no related news there. However, DUBAWA noticed that recent reports about the infamous French midfielders status and a move to a new club, including United, are only speculations. Yahoo Sports , Football 365 , and Goal.com have all suggested that Pogba may consider playing short-term for a club before joining a top-flight European outfit via summer transfer. All three outlets mentioned that the midfielder could play for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States when his suspension elapses in March 2025 . The claim is false, as no evidence exists that United has purchased the former French midfielder.",0
"Claim: Viral message on WhatsApp claims doctors in Lagos said taking Panadol with carbonated drinks kills. Verdict: False! The post was first circulated in 2016, and the doctor issued a disclaimer about not being involved in the article. We often see messages circulating on WhatsApp and other social media platforms signed with the names of famous personalities or experts in a field. Recently, a post has been circulating in different WhatsApp groups, warning people against using carbonated drinks to take panadol. The writer claimed a young politician died after taking 7up with Panadol. The message also appeared to be endorsed by notable doctors in the state. The message was shared with us by one of our readers for verification. The personalities involved made us verify it. To verify the claims veracity, we did a keyword search and saw that it was recurring. The claim was found to have been posted earlier on the Nairaland blog in 2016. Further investigation shows that a Facebook user posted the same narrative on June 22, 2021. We investigated the names mentioned in the story and found that the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), Lagos chapter, had issued a disclaimer on the issue in 2020 in The Sun Newspaper. The disclaimer allegedly signed by the NMA president, Francis Faduyile, said none of the purported doctors mentioned in the report had anything to do with it. This is to inform the public that none of those doctors have anything to do with this write-up, and the content of the write-up is UNVERIFIED. Babafemi Thomas, one of the doctors mentioned, noted that he was unaware of such a circular and had not met any other doctors listed in the article. I, Dr Babafemi Thomas, wish to dissociate myself from this circulating document posted. Its a scam. I do not know any of the listed doctors in this document, and we never met, Mr Thomas said. Lagos University Teaching Hospital spokesperson Kelechi Otuneme dissociated the institution from the report, saying it has no connection with the hospital. On whether drugs can be taken with carbonated drinks, Rajni Pathak, Co-ordinator of Preventive Health Check, Fortis Hospital Mohali, explained how most soft drinks and tea are acidic. Carbonated drinks, when combined with certain medicines, can lead to allergies or adverse effects in some patients. Hence, soft drinks should be avoided altogether. Soft drinks also restrict the absorption of iron. So, consuming iron supplements with soft drinks is bad. Juices and other drinks can also reduce the effect of medications on your body, thereby making them ineffective and slowing down the recovery process. This claim is recurring as it has surfaced online at different times. The National Medical Association also denied endorsing the post, even though some medical experts do not recommend using carbonated drinks with medications.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user with the name, Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld , has claimed that the linkage of National Identity Numbers (NINs) with SIM cards is a plot by the Nigerian Government to track and target social media users who use certain keywords to stimulate genocide in the country easier. Verdict: There is no evidence to prove the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is a plan to track social media users. According to available information, the policy as directed by the Federal Government is for security purposes and to ensure more controls over SIM ownership in Nigeria. A Facebook user with the name Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld on Dec. 24, posted that the Nigerian government was forcing Nigerians to link their NIN with SIM cards to make tracking of social media users easier. He added that the move would make it easy for the Federal Government to hire a company to compile a list of social media users who use some keywords to make targeted genocide easier. The Nigerian government is now saying they will force mobile phone providers to switch off all SIM cards that are not linked to a National Identification Number, he wrote. Why you should not do this? If you do, what becomes easy for the Nigerian government is to hire a company that shows a list of all citizens who write a certain key word on social media and in their phones and make lists per street who used those keywords, for instance everyone in the street who wrote Biafra. This is a tool that will make targeted genocide easier than ever before. As of December 27, the post had generated hundreds of reactions including 275 shares on Facebook. He wrote this following the Federal governments directive that all SIM owners in Nigeria must link their cards with their NINs or get blocked. Thousands of Nigerians have since trooped to NIN enrollment centres around the country to obtain their identification numbers. The Federal Government extended the deadline for incorporating NIN with SIM cards by six weeks after several complaints. According to the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), the linkage of SIM cards is necessary as more controls over SIM-card ownership are needed to secure electronic transactions and curb crime as insecurity bites harder in the country. The revision of the policy is based on the feedback received from the security agencies following the successful revalidation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their SIMs, Dr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said as he directed the NCC to revise the registration policy. The government added that the Boko Haram insurgency and kidnapping for ransom have been reinforced by telecom services. There are over 207 million subscribers according to the latest NCC data for October 2020 but only 42 million Nigerians had a National Identification Number (NIN) as of September 2020. According to online data portal, Statista, Nigeria has a population of 206 million and about 100 million of them are adults. According to an analyst , Yele Okeremi, the CEO of Precise Financial Systems, the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is meant to generate a single identity for phone users in Nigeria. He said it would help to know who is doing what with phones and to detect cybercriminals. The entire concept is to know who is doing what and where, so that it is not possible to go away with cyber crimes with multiple identities, he said. According to a statement released by the NCC, Pantami and all stakeholders agreed that the measure was necessary to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process and consolidate the achievements of the SIM registration exercise of 2019. The urgent drastic measures have now become inevitable to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process, the statement said. The claim that the Nigerian Government has directed linkage of NIN with SIM cards to target social media users and make genocide easy has no evidence to back it.

"Claim: A Twitter user claims that the terms and conditions of the Crowwe application are the same with those of Spotify. The claim that Crowwes Terms and Conditions were copied from Spotify is TRUE as findings reveal similarities. Also, the link found in Crowwes Terms and Conditions redirects users to Spotifys Terms and Conditions of Use. Amid the recent announcement of Twitter ban by the Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria, former Nigerian presidential candidate, Adamu Garba, has named the Crowwe application as the alternative to the microblogging website. In a statement on Friday, the federal government placed a ban on Twitter, saying the application undermines Nigerias corporate existence. This ban was greeted with outrage by Nigerians who felt the government had acted against the constitution which guaranteed freedom of expression. While some have devised other means of accessing Twitter, Adamu Garba, trended from Friday, the notion that the Crowwe application, could be an alternative. However, Twitter users have criticised the application on many grounds including its privacy policy. One other major criticism is the similarity of the terms and conditions with those of Spotify, a music streaming platform. A Twitter user, Ego Beke (@ rubylaren ) wrote that the terms and conditions of the Crowwe App are the same with Spotify. Check the Crowwe apps terms and conditions. Its the SAME thing as Spotify. They didnt even bother editing. Like if you click on the hyperlink it redirects you to Spotify theft. What sort of pangolo app is that? Excerpt of Ego Bekes claim. Another Twitter user Bukola (@bukiola) made the same claim with a 15-second video showing how a click on the terms and condition of the App leads to spotifys page. Also on Saturday June 6, 2021, a Twitter post by Tayo Dips (@tayo_dips) reported the Crowwe App to Spotify for copying its Terms and Conditions and also called for a lawsuit against Crowwe for plagiarism. Hi @Spotify Id like to report an intellectual property theft. The app @CrowweApp (Gloome Business Connections Ltd) made an authorised copy of your terms & conditions, WORD for WORD, uploading it on App Stores. I think you should file a lawsuit for infringing copyright. Excerpt of the Twitter post To verify these claims, Dubawa downloaded the Crowwe App on Google PlayStore, to get details about its terms and conditions. After downloading, Dubawa was greeted with a landing page, which directed users to read and accept the Apps Privacy Policy and Terms and Services. It says: Read our Privacy Policy . Tap Agree and Continue to accept the Terms of Services . Reading through the platforms Terms of Services, Dubawa observed that a link to the terms and conditions listed, redirected users to the Spotify Terms and Conditions of Use . This suggests that Crowwes Terms of Service were copied and edited from Spotifys Terms and Conditions of Use. It appears the owners or developers of the Crowwe App must have forgotten to delete the Spotify hyperlink. Dubawa also observed that although they had been edited, many items on Crowwes Terms and Conditions such as its Limitation on Liability and Disclaimer of Warranties, bear similarities with items on Spotifys Terms and Conditions of Use. Why Spotify, a Swedish music service launched in 2008 , and the Crowwe app launched in 2020 are linked with so many similarities in their T and C, is a cause for concern, seeing their functions do not even align. A Terms and Conditions agreement , also known as a T&C, Terms of Use or Terms of Service, is the legal backbone of the relationship between a mobile app and its users. This lists clauses that highlight the rules, requirements, restrictions and limitations that a user must agree to in order to use the mobile App. A Terms and Conditions is not mandatory like the Privacy policy under any laws or required by any app stores. Terms and Conditions is beneficial to the business that owns the App and to the users. Here are some of these benefits for businesses: To enjoy the above benefits, specific clauses and the demand for users to agree to be bound by them should be made and clearly stated, so that it can be enforced where necessary. For the user, here are some of the benefits: T&Cs can be developed by the owner of the business, a lawyer or using that of others as models or templates but this must be customized to suit your business, product or service. There are also websites that help you generate templates like Tertemplas terms and conditions generator , which makes it easy to create a Terms and Conditions agreement for your business. Because T&C agreements are often complex, copying or borrowing another entitys agreement is very tempting to save time and costs. Borrowing anothers T&C is common and generally legal, but doing so exposes your company to legal risks. One risk is that copying an agreement word-for-word is plagiarism and a violation of copyright law . Although business terms and conditions may not be the most creative pieces, they still fall under the definition of literary works and as such are protected in law. Also, if you copy the T & C agreement of another business it is likely that differences in location, policies, and other areas can prevent their T&C from actually being effective. The claim that Crowwes Terms and Conditions were copied from Spotify is TRUE as findings reveal that the link in Crowwes Terms and Conditions redirects to Spotifys Terms and Conditions of Use. Also, some items in the Crowwes Terms and Conditions bear similarities with items on Spotifys Terms and Conditions of Use.",1
"Claim: A picture containing about 17 dead persons laid side by side is said to show victims of extrajudicial killings at the Lekki toll-gate area. False. Findings show that the picture is actually from an unrelated incident in 2018. A Twitter user on Wednesday shared a picture claiming that the dead bodies belonged to some of the protesters who were at the Lekki Toll Plaza on Tuesday evening. RIP to those who lose their lives in #LekkiMasacre you efforts will never be forgotten. Retweet to show respect to the fallen heroes #LagosStateMassacre, she tweeted . The picture shows 17 corpses clad in red and white clothing and wrapped in transparent body bags. About a dozen people surrounded the bodies, most of them wearing face masks. The tweet was shared 776 times and liked by 512 users of the micro-blogging platform as of 7:35 pm on Wednesday. And the authors handle, @Prettywummex_, had over 32,800 followers at the same time. A reverse image search conducted on TinEye revealed that one of the earliest uses of the picture was in a report by New York Times, published as far back as November 2, 2018. The picture was credited to Afolabi Sotunde, a Reuters photographer. The accompanying caption reads: Members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria preparing the bodies of members killed when the Nigerian Army opened fire during the groups protests in the capital Abuja this week. The same picture was used in this report by ABC News published on November 4, 2018, with a similar caption: Bodies of members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, who were killed after security forces opened fire during the Shiite groups protests in Abuja, are pictured before their burial in Mararaba, Nigeria, Oct. 31, 2018. Guardian UK had reported on November 1 that at least 45 members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) were killed in Abuja and Nasarawa after soldiers opened fire on them during peaceful demonstrations. According to Amnesty International, 122 people also sustained gunshot wounds in the incidents. Meanwhile, Amnesty International has said at least 12 people were killed after officials of the army shot at protesters at the Lekki Toll Plaza in Lagos on Tuesday night and many others sustained injuries. The organisation further stated that over 56 deaths have been recorded nationwide since the protests against police brutality under the End SARS campaign started. The claim is false and misleading, though the IMN members it shows were killed in similar circumstances as far back as 2018 as the protesters in Lagos.

"Claim: A Facebook user, Ivan Jaw, has alleged on Facebook that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Sierra Leone issued a notice warning that the current weather is not West African Harmattan but an extreme form of air pollution dangerous to human health. Verdict: Mary Sia Foyah, Senior Public Relations Officer at the Environmental Protection Agency, has dismissed the claim, stating that the notice did not come from the EPA and is fake. A Facebook post by Ivan Jaw has gone viral, alarming many people online. The post claims to be an official notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Sierra Leone, advising citizens to take precautions against what it describes as an extreme form of air pollution. The post urges the public to take the information seriously, emphasising it is a reliable message from the EPA. The post reads: This is an important notice from EPA, and we must follow it. URGENT NOTICE! URGENT NOTICE!! URGENT NOTICE!!! Dear Sir/Madam, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed the public that the current weather in Sierra Leone is not a Harmattan but an extreme form of air pollution harmful to health. This can cause: Please take the following precautions: This situation may last for a while, so please stay safe and share this information with others. The post has since gained significant attention and caused panic among some citizens. Given the potential for misinformation, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA contacted Mary Sia Foyah, Senior Public Relations Officer at the Environmental Protection Agency. She unequivocally denied the posts authenticity, labeling it fake and stating that the EPA did not issue such notice. She explained, That information did not come from the EPA. It is false. We have already released a public disclaimer to alert the public that this message is not from us. Mary Sia Foyah further cautioned the public against relying on unverified information on social media. She urged people to confirm such notices with the appropriate authorities before sharing or acting on them. As part of the verification process, DUBAWA also reviewed other credible websites and platforms but did not see any report by the EPA. The claim made by a Facebook user Ivan Jaw that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warned about extreme air pollution instead of harmattan, is false. The EPA has disclaimed the message, emphasising that it is fake and does not represent any official communication from the agency. To avoid panic, citizens must verify such claims with credible sources before spreading them.",1
"Claim: Femi Adesina claims 30million Nigerians were unemployed in 2015 before Buhari came into power. The claim is false. Available data shows 17.7 million were unemployed in the first quarter of 2015, not 30 million. The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, claims 30million Nigerians were unemployed in 2015. Mr Adesina made this claim while featuring on Channel TVs programme Sunday Politics on March 28, 2021. Our verification started by viewing the 52 minutes 42 seconds clip on Channels Television Tv) YouTube page . Mr Adesina said that in 2015, the unemployment figure used for campaign by the All Progressives Congress was 30 million. He said this while reacting to the question on the unemployment rate and his governments promise to create jobs. Buildup of the 2015 election, when APC was campaigning, the figure that was used by the then-candidate Buhari, was that a minimum of 30 million were out of jobs, were unemployed particularly youth and that his government was going to do something about that. As of 2014/2015 the figure used for the campaign was 30 million unemployed Nigerians, its on record. Excerpt of Adesinas statement Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Nigerias unemployment rate in 2015 and this led to some reports. A report by Macrotrends shows a trend analysis of unemployment in Nigeria from 1991 to 2021. According to this, the unemployment rate for 2015 stood at 4.31%. Screenshot of Macrotrend graph and table. Data by Statista show in the first quarter of 2015, the unemployment rate in Nigeria stood at 7.54%, in the second quarter, 8.19%, in the third quarter, 9.9% and in the fourth quarter- 10.44% of the working-age population(age 15-64). The unemployment rate is calculated as a percentage of the number of unemployed persons in the labour force i.e. Unemployment Rate = 100 Unemployed Population/ Labor Force Population A report by ProShare showed that unemployment in the first quarter(Q1) of 2015 rose to 7.5%. According to ProShare, this means that 17.7 million people between ages 1565 were either unemployed or underemployed in the labour force. In Q1 2015, the labour force population increased to 73.4 million from 72.9million in Q4 2014, representing an increase in the labour force by 0.69%. This means 504,596 economically active persons within 1564 entered the labour force. Within the same period, the total number in full employment increased by 0.88%, while the number of underemployed declined by 6.46% resulting in a reduction in the underemployment rate to 16.6% (12.2mn) from 17.9% (13.1mn) in Q4 2014. The number of unemployed in the labour force, on the other hand, increased by 861,110 persons or 18.43% between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 resulting in an increase in the unemployment rate to 7.5% in Q1 2015 from 6.4% in Q4 2015. Accordingly, there were a total of 17.7 million people between ages 1565 either unemployed or underemployed in the labour force in Q1 2015. Dubawa tried finding unemployment statistics through the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for the year 2015 but figures for that year were not accessible. The available data was from 2017- 2018. Available statistics show in the first quarter of 2015 which was the last quarter before president Buhari came on board in May, 17.7 million Nigerians were unemployed with the unemployment rate at 7.5%. This makes the claim that 30 million Nigerians were unemployed to be false.",0
"Claim: Remdesivir has been restricted to vaccinate people in African countries in order to experiment on them and produce genetically modified human beings. False. Rather, the manufacturer of the drug in the United States gave licences to pharmaceutical companies in other regions, so they could produce generic versions that would be available to developing and underdeveloped countries. The labels on the drugs were merely showing the geographic limitations of the licences. A picture has been in circulation in the Nigerian internet space that appears to show that a different kind of remdisivir, a COVID-19 vaccine, was made specially for African countries. Not for distribution in U.S., Canada, or EU, says the labels on the drugs made separately by pharmaceutical companies Hetero Drugs, Cipla, and Jubilant Generics. In one publication on Nairaland, posted on Jan. 9, the author warned that developed countries were up to something fishy and planned to conduct experiments on Africans using the vaccine. Nairaland is the largest local online forum in Nigeria with over 2.6 million registered members. You can see from the pix that Africa has a special vaccine, while Europe is not to be administered. Why is it so? This is more than meets the eyes. The western world is up to somethings that we should not blindly follow, the forum user, Sunnycliff, wrote. Remember it is a nano chip that can be driven by a 5G technology. This is trans-humanism, an experiment of humanity in order to produce genetically modified human beings. Wise up please! On Thursday, former federal lawmaker, Dino Melaye, shared pictures of the Cipla drug through his verified page on Facebook. On the side of the pack is stated the instruction that the drug was only meant for use in 47 African countries, including Nigeria. What is the meaning of this biko [please]? he asked in the caption. The post, which was later deleted, had over 700 likes and hundreds of comments. It was shared on different blogs, including Opera News and Sleek Gist . First, remdesivir is not a COVID-19 vaccine. It was originally an investigational drug made by US-based biopharmaceutical company, Gilead Sciences, and considered for the treatment of hepatitis and the Ebola virus infection in 2014. After the outbreak of the coronavirus, studies found that it proved effective as an antiviral drug in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and shortened recovery period. In May 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorised the drug for emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe disease. It was the first drug approved by the U.S. regulatory body for COVID-19 treatment. Shortly afterwards, it was also approved for use by the United Kingdoms National Health Service (NHS). The World Health Organisation (WHO), however, stated in November 2020 that it was conditionally advising against the use of the drug as there was no evidence at the time that it improved survival and other outcomes in patients. The evidence suggested no important effect on mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, time to clinical improvement, and other patient-important outcomes, the UN agency said after reviewing data from over 7,000 patients across four trials. The manufacturers of remdesivir, Gilead, announced last year that they signed non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements with nine pharmaceutical companies based in Egypt, India and Pakistan to expand the drugs supply. The companies, namely Cipla, Hetero Labs, and Jubilant Lifesciences, were to ensure the drugs distribution in 127 countries. The countries consist of nearly all low-income and lower-middle-income countries, as well as several upper-middle- and high-income countries that face significant obstacles to healthcare access, the company explained . The licences are royalty-free until the World Health Organization declares the end of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding COVID-19, or until a pharmaceutical product other than remdesivir or a vaccine is approved to treat or prevent COVID-19, whichever is earlier. Under the agreements, the companies were exempted from paying royalties to Gilead and could set their own prices for the drugs generic version they would be producing. We are confident that these long-standing voluntary licencees can efficiently scale up production of high-quality, low-cost remdesivir, said Gilead spokesperson, Ryan McKeel. Generic drugs are generally the same as brand-name and, according to the FDA, have the same dosage form, safety, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use. What this means is that it is the same remdesivir that is being administered in the various countries. One of the generic versions of remdesivir, Covifor, has been sold in India since June 2020. About the label which says the drug is not to be distributed in the U.S., Canada, and European Union countries, the spokesperson for Hetero Labs, one of the licencees, explained that it was to prevent the drug from being sold illegally on the black market. We think that this photo is part of a malicious campaign to create confusion around this drug, the spokesperson added about the claim in circulation. Gilead had confirmed this too, telling Reuters that the labels only indicated restrictions in where the licencees could distribute the generic drugs. The claims are false. Remdesivir is not a vaccine specially made for Africans but an antiviral drug found helpful in treating COVID-19 patients and whose generic versions are being produced for countries in other regions of the world, including Africa. The generic drug has exactly the same qualities as the brand-name drug.

"Claim: A WhatsApp poster claims the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is receiving applications for admission into its HND Nursing programme. This call for applications is genuine. The government has approved the HND Nursing programme in Monotechnics. Dubawa received a poster allegedly from the Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria, requesting applications for admission from para-military personnel and civilians into its ND/HND Nursing Programme. What is common knowledge is for citizens to study nursing in Schools of Nursing, receive the Certificate in Basic Nursing (which qualifies them to take the Registered Nurse Professional Certification examination) and become Registered Nurses (RN) thereafter. Some universities in Nigeria have also commenced the B.Sc Degree programme in Nursing a few years back. Most Nigerians are however not familiar with ND/HND degree programmes in Nursing. This explains why some WhatsApp users expressed doubts about the authenticity of the call for applications. Nigerians are bombarded daily with fake calls for higher education and/or scholarships into higher education , and it is therefore understandable if they are worried about a programme that is not common knowledge. Dubawa searched online for the website of the Nigerian Army School of Nursing in Lagos but could not find any links. What Dubawa found were several other education websites which had shared the Nigerian Army School of Nursings 2021 Call for Applications. Dubawa then placed calls to the four mobile lines on the application poster and after several trials, an individual picked the call placed to 07063374043. A man answered the line and explained that the call for application is genuine. The army officer, who demanded not to be identified due to service rules explained that the Nigerian government had reformed nursing education in Nigeria in collaboration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) . He said citizens can now earn degrees in Nursing through Universities (B.Sc Nursing) and Monotechnics (ND/HND Nursing). Students who study nursing in Monotechnics will write two professional examinations organised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria to undertake their Registered Nurse Professional Certification (RN) and the Registered Midwife Professional Certification (RM), he explained. He stated further that the HND is a straight four year course, the first two years is ND while the last two years is the HND, and the HND is compulsory. They cant just walk away after the ND. They will also do a one year attachment before proceeding for NYSC. The Army Officer who insisted on being anonymous said the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is currently working on its website and hopes to have it up for Nigerians soon. A Nigerian parent, Mr. Dahiru Garba, also confirmed to Dubawa that his daughter is undertaking her HND programme in Nursing in the College of Nursing, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi State and that the HND programme in Nursing is genuine and has been approved by the government. He also told Dubawa that the Nursing and Midwifery Council is proposing to phase out the Certificate in Basic Nursing programme in 2023 and Nigerians can only do the ND/HND degree or the B.Sc degree programmes in nursing because there are issues with placing holders of the Certificate in Basic Nursing qualification in the civil service. Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Lagos was approved in 2018 (alongside 265 other approved institutions ) for the training of nurses in Nigeria by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) as well as by the National Board of Technical Education . The Nigerian government approved the HND degree programme in Nursing, to be offered by monotechnics in the country in 2016 under a collaboration between the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (N&MCN). The current call for applications for admission by the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is genuine.

"Claim : Multiple online sources claim that Tobi Amusan won gold for Nigeria at the Paris Olympic Games. Verdict: Misleading! The video shared was from Tobi Amusans 2023 World Athletics championship win. The womens 100m hurdles final at the Paris Olympic Games will be held on August 10, 2024. The Paris Olympic Games 2024 kicked off in France on July 26 and will end on August 11. Nigeria is participating in the games with 84 athletes across 12 sports. Tobi Amusan, the reigning African and World record holder in 100m hurdles, was Nigerias flagbearer during the opening ceremony of the competition. On August 2, RNN TV, a YouTube channel, claimed that Tobi Amusan had broken the world record at the ongoing Olympic games. The video was viewed by 27,000 YouTubers, and in the comment section, YouTubers congratulated her on the achievement. On X, her name was trending as users continued to roll out congratulatory messages for her. As of early morning on August 4, 2024, her name Tobi was second on the trend list after President Tinubu on the platform. One of the popular posts on X was shared by Bukky (@_Callmebekky). The handle posted , Tobi Amusan has broken two Olympic records in one night. Tobi Amusan wins the hurdles. The post has 460,000 views, 20,000 likes, 2,700 retweets and comments. Similar posts can be found here , here and here . Senator Dino Melaye also used his X account ( @_dinomelaye) on July 31 to congratulate the World Record Holder. Mr Melaye wrote, Tobi Amusan, Nigerias hurdles sensation, made history last night at the Paris Olympics Games. She shattered not one but TWO world records in a single evening, leaving the world in awe. Congratulations to Tobi Amusan on this incredible feat! Similar posts can be found on Facebook here , here and here . Due to the suspicions surrounding the video shared, we conducted a fact-check. We analysed the videos keyframe using Google Reverse Image Search. We found the video on the World Athletics YouTube page. It was recorded at the World Athletics Championship in Oregon in 2022 . The Punch Newspaper and Premium Times reports in 2022 also confirmed that Amusan ran the record-breaking race in 2022. Amusan broke the African and world records twice in the finals with 12.12secs in the semi-final and 12.06secs in the final, beating the previous 12.20secs set by USAs Keni Harrison in 2016. We went through the official website of the Paris Olympic Games 2024. We found that the Womens 100m hurdles race will begin on August 7, and the final race is set for August 10 in France. The claim that Tobi Amusan has won gold for Nigeria at the ongoing Paris Olympic Games 2024 is misleading! The video shared was from the World Athletics Championship in Oregon in 2020. The 100m hurdles race is slated for August 7 and 10 at the Paris Olympic Games 2024. This report is produced for the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame Karikari Fact-Checking Fellowship in partnership with The Hope Newspaper to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in Nigeria.",0
"Claim: X user shares a video claiming that terrorists have taken over Ondo, forcing residents to flee their homes. Verdict: Misleading! The video depicts residents fleeing their homes after a recent communal clash in Ilobu, Osun State. It has nothing to do with the attack in Ondo State. Nigeria is a diverse country with over 250 ethnic groups with distinct cultures, languages, and traditions. While this diversity can be a source of strength and richness, it has also been a source of tension and conflict. The Voice of Igbos on X posted a video showing many people fleeing their homes. In the video, many people can be seen trekking with loads on their heads. The 48-second videos caption reads, So Ondo is now occupied by terrorists, people are leaving their homes, and Yoruba conservatives are quiet. People that cant secure and manage their small villages, how on earth do you expect them to handle Nigeria Affairs? This post has sparked discussion among social media users. In the comment section, Bobmanuel C. Echeonwu (@BobEcheonwu), perplexed, wrote, Is this not a war situation? What is the Nigerian state waiting for to declare war on these marauding aliens? Do we still have a country like this? Another user, Agbo Maduabuchi (@agboohaka2277), believed the claim and responded, Yorubas will never be at peace because theyre the ones creating problems here and there. As of March 23, 2025, the post had gone viral, amassing 37,700 views, 535 reposts, 919 likes, and 51 bookmarks. DUBAWA chose to fact-check the video due to its virality and potential to spread misinformation and incite ethnic wars. In the circulating video, a man speaking in Yoruba shouts, Ilobu ti tn o! Ilobu ti tn o! H! Kld? n w nlobu. f pa w tn nIlobu ni? When translated, it means, Ilobu is finished! Ilobu is finished! H! Whats the matter?! Have mercy on us in Ilobu. Do you want to kill us all in Ilobu?! Ilobu is a town and the Irepodun Local Government Area administrative headquarters of Osun State. It is bordered on the north by Ifon-Osun, on the south by Osogbo, on the east by Oba, and the west by Erin-Osun. Apart from Osun State, DUBAWA did not find Ilobu anywhere in Ondo. Two unsettling events occurred in the Southwest in March 2025. The first, reported on the 16th, was a Fulani herdsmen attack on Ondo State farmers, which led to a protest. The second event was a communal clash between the Ilobu and Ifon communities in Osun State, reported on the 21st. While different protest videos had been shared on X immediately after the Fulani herdsmen attack, social media users like @Voice of Igbos took the footage from the Osun communal clash, tweaked the narrative, and posted it as though it was related to the Ondo State occurrence. We found several other users who posted this video to depict the event as it truly happened in Osun State. You can find them here and here . Our findings revealed that the video emanated from a communal clash at Ilobu in Osun, not Ondo State, as depicted. Therefore, the video is misleading.",0
"CLAIM: A WhatsApp Message claims UBA and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are giving out a 500,000 Naira grant. This information is misleading as it originates from a questionable website fraudulently leading people to share its link. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic , many countries, including Nigeria, were forced to enforce the stay home order which in a way contributed to the increase of fake news. As the lockdown became effective, Dubawa quickly shifted from fact checking claims relating to cure, spread, and who had tested positive to the virus to news of COVID-19 relief grants . The relief grants are presented as a kind of support supposedly given to citizens by the government to help sustain them through the lock down till normalcy was returned. In the interim, misinformation started circulating on social media, especially WhatsApp, informing people to register for varied amounts of money; from 5000 to 30000 . Now, over a year after Nigeria had its first case of Covid-19, grants-related claims have become prevalent. On Wednesday 3rd of March, Dubawa received a circulating WhatsApp Message which conveys a testimony of a grant beneficiary. A beneficiary claimed he had just gotten a grant from the United Bank for Africa (UBA) in collaboration with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). He further enjoined readers to apply through an attached link. This WhatsApp Broadcast, unlike others of its kind, strikes differently as it comes in form of a testimony of a beneficiary which is likely to have more influence on readers. A click on the link attached to the post takes readers to a website ( Student Gist ) where the publisher explains what the grant is about and how to apply for it. The website stated that the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has started issuing out the application forms for an alleged N75billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund. FG launches application for N75 billion Youth Investment Fund at 5% interest, how to apply The Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, on Thursday, October 15, 2020, flagged off the application for the N75 billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) recently approved by the Federal Government. In the bid to ascertain the veracity of the claim, Dubawa identified a major red flag; an inconsistency between the Message shared on WhatsApp and the information on the website it directs readers to, thereby, producing two claims. The WhatsApp Message announces a N500,000 grant by UBA and CBN while on the second website , the focus is on an alleged N75billion Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) from the Ministry of Youth and Sports and the CBN. Although the websites About Us page provided no result, its homepage shows it gives updates on latest jobs in Nigeria. Dubawa analyzed the website, using the ScamDoc tool. While it has a 76% trust score , the tool advised that more investigations be carried out on the website. Dubawa also found that on the 22nd of July, 2020, the Federal Executive Council approved the sum of N75, 000,000,000.00 (seventy five billion naira) for the establishment of the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund for the period of 2020 2023. The investment plan which is an initiative of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development (FMYSD) aims to create 500,000 jobs, to curtail the issue of unemployment amongst the youth, and improve access to finance for youth and youth-owned enterprises for national development. The plan targets young people between the ages of 18-35 years. Dubawa, on the CBN website found a pop-up, redirecting to the actual website where interested youth can register for the fund. Further, calls were made to the Ministry, where Mr John Joshua Akanji who is the ministers Special Adviser (Media) acknowledged the existence of the N75 Billion NYIF and told Dubawa he is unaware of any website besides the ministrys. In his word, I dont know about any website, the only authentic website I know is the ministrys website. Therefore, while it is true that there is an existing fund from the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development, the website sharing the information and asking people to register through its platform is fake. Hence, the information is False. In most cases, it is impossible to trace forwarded information on WhatsApp to its original source, but for this particular claim about the alleged 500,000 grant from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the United Bank for Africa, Dubawa identified that it is a product of Student Gist. Dubawa found that after registering for NYIF through the imposter site, applicants would be asked to share the opportunity with 15 groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp. Dubawa shared the link to its personal WhatsApp for a test run and the process produced the same texts as it is in the viral claim. On going back to the site, it identified that this researcher had only shared once as a message popped up on the screen to remind the user that his application is only successful after sharing to 15 groups or 15 friends. In essence, this experiment shows how fake news purveyors fraudulently lead people to spread misinformation and drive traffic to their websites. Nonetheless, Dubawa directed calls, a text and a WhatsApp message to CBN and UBA but none were attended to. This researcher, however, visited UBAs Aminu Kano Crescent branch in Abuja. There, Mr Mathew A, the Customer Service Manager told Dubawa hes unaware of any N500,000 grant and suggested the viral message may be fraudulent. Findings show that while the National Youth Investment Funds exists, theres no alternative link for application order than the one provided by the Ministry of Sports and Youth Development. It is also important to note that there is no N500,000 grant anywhere from UBA, the WhatsApp Message is a product of a fraudulent website seeking attention through spreading fake news, rendering its claims FALSE and MISLEADING.",0
"CLAIM: St Joseph Primary School polling station in Central Freetown is yet to start voting more than an hour after ECSL voting time officially ended. EyeWitnessNewsSL reported delayed voting at polling station 16148 at the St. Joseph Primary School eight hours into voting. With two hours to go for the polls to end officially, the report suggests the angry electorate are yet to cast their ballot. DUBAWA rushed to the centre at 6:45 GMT and confirmed that the voters were yet to cast their ballots more than an hour after voting officially closed. The polling centre manager Deborah Jaward explained that voting had been delayed due to the absence of the voting roster. According to her, the original centre manager for the polling station was chased out by the angry voters who were tired of waiting without end for the roster. DUBAWA observed armed police and military officers deployed to the station to protect the new Center Manager and maintain law and order. Around 7:30 GMT when DUBAWA was leaving the polling station, voting had still not started, and the electorates were seething angrily. VERDICT: True",1
"After the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was discovered, there have been amid other concerns, amid concerns that vaccines wont be effective against the new strand, thereby fueling vaccine hesitancy. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message made several claims around vaccines, vaccinated and unvaccinated people. According to this message, fully vaccinated people pose a threat in winter and must be quarantined while others claim that vaccines do not work. The message also claims the booster shots make COVID-19 cases worse and that unvaccinated persons are not dangerous. Seeing that this message contains several claims, Dubawa identified the different claims and verified them individually. Claim 1: Vaccinated people must be quarantined in winter because they pose a danger. False This WhatsApp message claims that vaccinated persons must be quarantined over the winter months or else risk serious illnesses. This claim was allegedly made by Christian Perronne, a former vice president of the World Health Organisations European Advisory Group of Experts in Immunisation. The World Health Organisation European Advisory Group of Experts in Immunisation, former vice president, professor Christain Perronne, yesterday said that all vaccinated people must be quarantined over the winter months or risk serious illnesses. Excerpt of the claim. A keyword search led to a Twitter post by Dr. Jesse Livermore LL.M.,PH.D (@JessieLivermore) on September 20, 2021 with a similar claim. In this tweet the claim is that Pfizer said vaccinated people can harm unvaccinated people. This tweet had the link to a website which carries a story from May 2021 where Pfizer allegedly confirmed that vaccinated people can shed spike protein and harm the unvaccinated. The WHO has approved 8 vaccines for COVID-19 after having vetted their efficiency, effectiveness and safety. According to Bloomberg , more than 8.23 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered across 184 countries. Fully vaccinated persons according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , are less likely to develop serious illness and vaccine shedding can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus which is not so in the case of the COVID-19 vaccines. The spike proteins (which is also found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19) in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use mRNA technology, are produced after the vaccine sends instructions to the bodys cells. The cells make the protein which our immune system recognizes as a foreign body and responds to by producing antibodies. The spike proteins are harmless, do not cause illness and do not last long in the body. This makes the claim false. Christian Perronne is a Professor of Infectious and Tropical Diseases at the University of Versailles-St Quentin, Paris-Saclay, France. He has, however, been identified as a controversial doctor known in conspiracy theory circles for his criticism of health policy in the fight against COVID-19. Our search on the said WHO advisory group led us to the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) which indicates that Christin Perronne is not on the list of current and former members . The current chair of SAGE is Dr. Alejandro Cravioto. Claim 2: Unvaccinated people are not dangerous False Unvaccinated persons are still a risk to people around them, especially people with weak immune systems. Christopher Martin, a professor of public health at West Virginia University, was reported to have said that these unvaccinated groups create more opportunity for the virus to mutate. Large numbers of unvaccinated people do make variants more likely. If any one of these random errors confers an advantage to that virus, such as making it more contagious like delta, that variant can quickly become the dominant one circulating in the population, he said. Although there have been breakthrough COVID cases among vaccinated persons, the majority of hospitalizations and ICU cases are among unvaccinated people. Ghazala Sharieff , chief medical officer for acute care and clinical excellence said The bottom line is that the COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing both infections and deaths. Claim 3: 95% of seriously ill patients in Israel are vaccinated. Misleading The message also claims an Isreali doctor, Kobi Havi, said 95% of seriously ill patients are vaccinated. 95% of seriously ill patients are vaccinated. Fully vaccinated people account for 85-90% of hospitalisation, a part of the claim reads. Who is Hobi Haviv? According to one of the LinkedIn profiles found, Hobi Haviv is a team leader at Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries in Israel. Another profile says he is operational excellence leader, Elbit Land Systems at Elbit Systems Ltd. According to this report by haaretz.com , Dr. Kobi Haviv, is the head of the Herzog rehabilitation hospital in Jerusalem. We also found an interview video of Dr Haviv on UGETube with this claim in the caption. Dr. Kobi Haviv, earlier today on Chanel 13 news Israel 13,95 percent of the severe patients are vaccinated, the caption reads. Although the interview was not in English, it had English subtitles. Dr. Haviv said most of the population is vaccinated, and 90%85-90% of the hospitalisation here are fully vaccinated people. Yes unfortunately the vaccine, as they say, its effectiveness is waning. Outbreaks in hospitals one patient infects a large number of people, it is not just here and there parts of the interview subtitle read. According to Reuters , around half of Israels 600 patients presently hospitalised with severe illness have received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. However, it notes that this is a rare occurrence out of 5.4 million fully vaccinated people. The majority of these patients who received two vaccine doses at least five months ago, are over the age of 60 and have chronic illnesses like diabetes, heart disease, lung ailments etc known to exacerbate a coronavirus infection. Also, according to a study published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine, COVID-19 breakthrough cases were found in health care workers. Among 11,453 fully vaccinated health care workers, 1497 (13.1%) underwent RT-PCR testing during the study period. Of the tested workers, 39 breakthrough cases were detected, part of the studys result reads. While it is true that breakthrough cases have been found, the alleged percentage is misleading. Claim 4: The effectiveness of vaccines is declining or disappearing Misleading It is true that immunity from the initial vaccine dose(s) naturally starts to wane over time which is the reason for booster shots , but this does not translate to vaccine effectiveness declining or disappearing. Effectiveness of vaccines varies from one vaccine to another, but all approved vaccines are still effective against infection and severe illnesses. Real-world effectiveness data by CDC shows Johnson and Johnson is 71% effective at preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19 in adults who do not have compromised immune systems, whileModerna is 93% and Pfizer is 88% effective. Claim 5: Booster jabs will make cases worse False COVID-19 vaccine booster shots are now authorised for all adults in the U.S., and anyone 18 years and older who has completed the Pfizer or Moderna primary vaccine series at least six months ago or the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at least two months ago is eligible for a booster shot . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends boosters six months after the second dose of one of the mRNA COVID vaccines (Pfizer or Moderna) because data on the vaccines efficacy suggests that after that amount of time has passed, the vaccines start to offer less protection. For Johnson and Johnson on the other hand, boosters are recommended two months after the first shot because the CDC data on the vaccines performance in real-world conditions showed that it is only 71% effective at preventing hospitalisation from COVID-19 in adults who did not have compromised immune systems. This is less, compared to Modernas 93% and Pfizers 88% effectiveness rate. Claim 6: Vaccines dont work False Vaccines work, which is why they were given approval by the FDA . Although a study published in the Lancet shows that there is increasing evidence that vaccinated individuals continue to have a relevant role in transmission and that people with weak immune systems build lower levels of antibodies, there is still some protection from vaccination . This viral WhatsApp message with several claims on COVID-19 is replete with falsehood.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user recently claimed that resting a laptop computer on the thigh or bare skin is hazardous to ones health and can lead to skin cancer because of the dangerous emission. There is no established scientific study connecting cancer with radiation emitting from a laptop. However, the radiation can alter testicular cells and contribute to male infertility, a health disorder leading to a mans inability to cause pregnancy in a fertile female. A social media user, Hammed Yakub, in a Facebook post on Saturday, July 10, issued a stern warning against consistent resting of laptop, a mobile personal computer (PC), on the laps or bare skin, arguing that it is dangerous to health. Although he did not support his claim with any established scientifically proven data, the social media user stated that men are mostly at risk because the radiation emitted from the PC is different from the known heat. He said the heat may lead to skin cancer and infertility. He, however, advised that PC users should place their laptop on a desk instead of on the lap. We need to be careful with some of the gadgets we use. Most of them are affecting our health without us knowing. We face our phone every minute with uncontrolled brightness. Light from these phones is gradually damaging our sight. We need to watch our habit on laptop usage, he claimed For people, especially men placing their PC on the thighs and bare skin, they are likely to have skin cancer or at some point battle with infertility. The radiation from our laptops is not the usual heat. It is dangerous. We need to place our laptops on a flat desk first before placing it on our thighs. I don talk my own (Ive said my own). Due to the increase in the use of highly sophisticated gadgets in Africa, there has been a seemingly renewed call warning against placing laptops on the thighs and bare skin, with a number of unproven opinions submitting that users are open to various health hazards. One of all the health risks often touted is cancer. For instance, in its article titled 6 Reasons To NEVER Place Your Laptop on Your Lap, a health blog, Vest Tech , claimed that radiation from PC does not only cause harm to the reproductive organ but also develop into skin cancer. The website cited a report by dermatologist Anthony J. Mancini, who claimed that prolonged skin inflammation can potentially increase the chances of squamous cell skin cancer, which is more aggressive than the more common form of skin cancer. While this has been staying for long, a research by Dubawa established that there is no connection between cancer and PC radiation. But what is cancer and PC? According to the National Cancer Institute , a website contributing to cancer research globally, cancer is a disease in which the bodys cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. The health research hub stated that cancer can start almost anywhere in the human body, which is made up of trillions of cells. Of course, under normal circumstances human cells grow and normally multiply to form new cells as the body needs them. When cells grow old or become damaged, they die, and new cells take their place. Cancerous tumors spread into, or invade, nearby tissues and can travel to distant places in the body to form new tumors (a process called metastasis). Cancerous tumors may also be called malignant tumors, the website further explained. The World Health Organisation (WHO) described cancer as a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body and/or spread to other organs. WHO explained that the cancer burden grows globally because it is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths, or one in six deaths, in 2018. World Cancer Day , an initiative of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), classified cancer as Carcinoma, Sarcoma, Lymphoma and Myeloma, Leukaemia and Brain and spinal cord cancers. The website attributed the causes of cancer to alcohol, obesity or being overweight, bad nutrition, lack of physical activities, Ionising radiation, infection and a bad environment. Ecommputers , a website that provides details about computers, described a laptop as a microprocessor technology that has been any small, relatively inexpensive computer designed to be used by one person at home or in an office. The typical personal computer assemblage, according to Britannica , consists of a central processing unit (CPU), which contains the computers arithmetic, logic, and control circuitry on an integrated circuit; two types of computer memory, main memory, such as digital random-access memory (RAM). It also has an auxiliary memory, such as magnetic hard disks and special optical compact discs, or read-only memory (ROM) discs (CD-ROMs and DVD-ROMs); and various input/output devices, including a display screen, keyboard and mouse, modem, and printer. Findings by Dubawa established that Laptops emit radio waves and other electronic signals known as Electro-magnetic radiation (EMRs) in various frequencies. This is extremely detrimental to the body as they cause discomfort when laptops are placed on bare skin. Prolonged exposure to these EMRs are known to cause a variety of other problems and disorders, one of them described as toasted skin by dermatologist and dermatosurgeon, Dr Shenaz Z Arsiwala. Despite this, there is no proven data that the EMRs radiation causes cancer. According to Cancer Council Australia (CCA), a national organisation which aims to promote cancer-control policies and to reduce the illness caused by cancer in Australia, there is no link between using a portable (laptop) computer and cancer. In its response to numerous questions about cancer and PC, the institute explained there is no established research that cells can be damaged in the body due to PC radiation. While some studies show heat from various sources, not just laptops can affect a mans sperm and fertility, there is no research linking heat from laptops to cell damage or cancer. There have been cases of toasted skin syndrome (mottled skin condition caused by long-term heat exposure) in people who used laptops resting on their legs for long periods, the council submitted. When Dubawa contacted a health expert and dermatologist at the LAUTECH Teaching Hospital, Dr. Lukman Adefabi, it was explained that the only radiation that can cause cancer is x-ray which can lead to mutation or change in the cells structure. Radiation can cause cancer but depending on the intensity of the radiation. When the intensity is accumulating in the cells, it can lead to cell mutilation (an alteration in the genetic material (the genome) of a cell of a living organism or of a virus). When there is a high and uncontrolled rate of cell division or the cells being altered due to excessive and accumulated radiation, it results in cancer. Dr Lukman explained that resting a laptop on bare thighs can lead to changes in the nature of the testis cells. This, according to him, can reduce sperm productionbut it rarely leads to cancer (of testitis, not skin). Rarely it can cause cancer of that testis, but can change the nature of that testis due to accumulation of radiation in the testis, he added. The testis, as defined by the Weil Cornell Centre for Male Reproductive Medicine and Microsurgery , is the male reproductive gland which is contained within a scrotum, which is an extension of the abdominal wall. Hasmik Soloyan and Sargis Sedrakyan in their paper titled Encyclopedia of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine published in 2019 stated that testes contain very fine-coiled tubes, called seminiferous tubules and are covered with tough membrane, tunica albuginea. Dr Adefabi submitted that radiation from the laptops cannot cause skin cancer as widely speculated. The exaggerated claim that emission from the PC can lead to cancer has been staying too long in the centre of discussion due to the rise in the number of PC users and access to various advanced gadgets. While there are different damages these gadgets can cause on our individual healths such as male infertility, but when the testicular cells are damaged, there is no proof it causes cancer.

"Claim : Delta State University has made Pidgin language a compulsory course for its students. Verdict : False; both students and staff of the institution have refuted this information. Whether students should be taught in their local languages has been a topic of argument among Nigerians. Campus Catch Nigeria , a Facebook blog, recently posted that Delta State University (DELSU), in Abraka, Delta State has now made Pidgin language a compulsory course. Consequently, this claim has resurrected the age-long debate among Facebook users. While some thought it was a commendable move by the institution, others argued about its usefulness. For instance, Eli Jah Gwazah , believing this information as accurate, said it would promote the image of Nigeria. Thats a development having something of our own being recognized and taught in schools,at Least it shows that theres glimpse of hope but I dont understand why people be laughing or finding it funny, he wrote in the comment section. Similarly, Caleb Abiala wanted a similar approach in the southwest, saying Wow, I think Yoruba too should be made compulsory for schools in the southwest Opinion though. On the flipside, Ifechukwu Joseph , another user in total expression of doubt, typed, This same Delsu where I they? Due to questions that his comment raised, DUBAWA decided to check the authenticity of the claim. We contacted Mr Joseph whose comment warranted this fact-check in his Facebook DM. As a 400-level Microbiology student in the school, he refuted the claim, calling it a lie. Its nothing but a lie or a social media joke to stereotype Deltans and their love for Pidgin English, he told DUBAWA. Similar to Mr Josephs stance, Ekporo Caroline, a recent graduate from this institution, also debunked the assertion. She termed it as false news. Likewise, Dr. Uche Esegwue, an academic staff of the institution, disproved the claim. He said, The official training language in DELSU is English. Also, DUBAWA contacted Ben Nwanne, the Director of Information at the institution. Like others, he debunked the claim saying, No, thats absolutely untrue. Both students and staff at the institution have denied this information. Conclusively, it is an untrue assertion.",1
"The Facebook account Trade union Congress investment platform promises to double users money, saying people are making millions from this.

Africa Check has exposed several Facebook accounts falsely claiming to offer investment opportunities to Nigerians. But is this page and its offers legit? We checked. One of the signs of a scam is poor writing. The posts by the suspicious account are mostly riddled with spelling errors and random capitalisation. For example, in most of its posts where its supposed address is included, it spells the word headquarters as Headuater. A trade union with millions of members would be expected to communicate professionally. Another red flag is the promise of unrealistic returns in a short period of time. In a tweet in 2022, Nigerias Economic and Financial Crime Commission urged users to be wary of such businesses: Do not fall victim of these online investments Know that NO investment gives those fantastic returns. The posts also ask users to send messages to the WhatsApp link attached in order to register. Fraudsters often use this tactic to obtain would-be investors personal information such as name and national identification number, or NIN. Africa Check couldnt find the Trade union Congress investment platform on the list of TUCs affiliates nor any mention of the platform on the unions website.

"CLAIM: People should eat watermelon with the seeds as it contains vital nutrients essential to the body. Viral post on WhatsApp advising people to eat watermelon with the seeds because it is enriched with a lot of essential minerals and vitamins is TRUE. Recently, a viral message on social media, especially on WhatsApp claimed that watermelon seeds are one of the most nutrient-dense varieties of seeds, which are rich in proteins, vitamins, magnesium, zinc and potassium which are all vital nutrients. Many people in Africa believe in the efficacy of herbs in treating different diseases. These days, it is common to see claims about these cures on social media. While many of such claims may not be true, others are. Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing , vine-like plant, it was originally domesticated in Africa. It is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties. Watermelon Source: Britanica.com Watermelon is an incredibly hydrating fruit as it contains around 92 percent of water, and is enriched with a lot of essential minerals and vitamins. This succulent melon also contains a lot of seeds, which we generally throw away after consumption. Dubawa researched why watermelon seed is believed to be an essential seed. A search on the website of Science Publishing Group , an independent international publisher of open access, online, peer-reviewed journals covers a wide range of academic disciplines. The Group has a post in the International Journal on Nutrition and Food Nutrition containing research carried out by Faustina Dufie Wireko-Manu an Associate Professor in Food Science and Technology, Dr. Jacob K. Agbenorhevi a Senior Lecturer, Elsa I. Ompouma and Betty Tabiri, all of the Department of Food Science and Technology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana. The research titled Watermelon Seeds as Food: Nutrient Composition, Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity was published on March 30, 2016. Screenshot of journal The research recognised the fact that watermelon seeds are often discarded while the fruit is eaten. The study analyzed seeds of three varieties of watermelon (Charleston gray, Crimson sweet and Black diamond) for their proximate, minerals, phytochemicals, total phenols content and antioxidant activity. The proximate analysis and phytochemicals screening were performed using standard procedures whereas mineral content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Screenshots of findings The study showed that watermelon seeds are a rich source of fibre and minerals that are essential in the body system. The Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin and a Professor of Food Science and Technology Mrs Yinka Ramota Karim, stated that the watermelon seeds contain a high level of magnesium which is essential for many of the bodys metabolic functions, maintains nerve and muscle functions as well as immune, heart and bone health. She added: The seeds of the watermelon improves skin health by treating acne, blemishes, wrinkles and ageing, helps in strengthening the hair, improves heart health, boosts the immune system, improves male fertility, boosts energy levels among others. Similarly, a food nutritionist, Mrs Yejide Akinseyin stated that watermelon seeds are one of the secrets of nature that can be used for many things that benefits the body like a snack ( roasted and milled into flour for the production of snack), salad dressings, especially the oils expressed from it and smoothies. Although patients who are suffering from low blood sugar are advised not to consume much of this seed as it has the ability to further lower blood pressure which may lead to sudden death, apart from that the watermelon seed is very nutritious and safe for every healthy individual, she said. An article posted in the Times of India highlighted the amazing health benefits of eating watermelon seeds which it describes as low in calories and offer an array of micronutrients like copper, zinc, potassium, magnesium, iron, folate etc; which have various health benefits. Some of them are listed below: Watermelon seeds are also linked with stronger immunity and better health. Due to the presence of magnesium these seeds can also cure hypertension, which is directly related to heart health. Consumption of watermelon seeds daily in moderate quantities helps in boosting your heart health and maintaining your blood pressure. Watermelon seeds have a high content of minerals like copper, manganese and potassium. And these minerals together with other micronutrients help in making our bones healthier. The seeds are linked with strengthening our bones and also improving bone density. Watermelon seeds are a powerhouse of nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, potassium. These seeds are considered to be highly nutritious, as they are also rich in amino acids, proteins and vitamin B complex. All these nutrients together help in boosting your bodys metabolism. They contain certain healthy fats which are extremely important for the body.

"Claim : A viral video shows international Hollywood actors holding placards that display support for the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi. The video is edited. A deep fake software was used to alter the original video to create the false information. None of the actors videos was made for Mr Obi. It began with Idris Elba, a popular British actor laughing with Matthew McConaughey a 53-year-old American actor who held a placard. On it was a statement that reads, Yes, it makes sense. Vote Peter Obi in 2023 . For the next 1 minute 53 seconds, the stage was shared between different international actors like Tom Cruise, Doug Liman, Gerard Butler, and 50 Cent. All held the same board with the inscription. As Nigeria prepares for its Presidential election on February 25, 2023, a video showing popular international movie actors campaigning for Peter Obi the Labour Partys flag bearer naturally ruffles more feathers as it portrays an international endorsement for the party, widely considered a political underdog at the poll. However, the placards texture raises questions. Also, the actors words were silenced as only sounds played from the video. It seems glaring that the footage was altered. But two notable persons shared the video via their verified social media accounts to their large followers with captions that denoted their political allegiance. Charles Oputa, known as Charly Boy, is racking up more than 247,000 views on Twitter with the video he tweeted on November 21, which also gained more than 14,800 reactions, 7,082 retweets, and 1,222 comments. The veteran singer wrote, Impressive. Peter Obis campaign has taken on a global outlook with leading American TV and Hollywood actors driving the campaign. Mike Asukwo, a veteran cartoonist, also shared the video on his verified Facebook account today with the caption, I just want to be proud of my country again. As of press time, the video has gained more than 5,600 views, 171 comments and 515 reactions. 197 accounts have also shared it. An account with the username, Lu Benson, prayed in pidgin that the dream [Obis victory] should come true because Nigerians have endured enough. He said, God abeg make this dream a reality. Weve suffered a lot nah. Another account, Awele Ideal, expressed her interest in the video and requested that it be sent to her. The same video gained trends on Tiktok too. An account with the handle, @@sheks_bibi, shared the video with the caption, Peter Obi for President 2023 #peterobi #2023election #vote. As of press time, the video has gained 5,489 likes, 383 comments and 1,953 shares. The comments on the posts showed that people believed the footage to be valid. This made DUBAWA run a fact-check to verify. DUBAWA ran a manual check on the video and found a YouTube handle, Eva Luca , who uploaded a replica of the video 3 months ago. The difference is the inscription on the placard. It reads, Your text, photo or logo here, meaning it can be edited. About 39 actors were listed in the video that was uploaded on July 23, which included the previously mentioned. The footage also showed how users could alter the video collections available. Attempts to uncover the particular tool used for the video editing were unsuccessful, though there are diverse apps that can be used for the purpose. DUBAWA discovered the videos separately in their original formats through further findings. They were all obtained from a YouTube channel owned by WIRED , an American magazine that illuminates how technology affects every aspect of lifefrom culture to business, science to design, according to the website description. The channel runs a programme called the Autocomplete Interview , where popular American entertainers are brought to the channel to answer the webs most searched questions about them displayed on a placard. For comparison, we obtained screenshots of Terry Crews, a famous American actor and television host, from the three situations available. Screenshot of Terry Crews on the original WIRED video. The videos, though shared by verified accounts of prominent persons, were altered to promote a false narrative. The actors in the original videos did not endorse Peter Obi.",0
"Claim : A viral post on Facebook states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all banks ATM cards currently used by customers. Verdict: TRUE. The Central Bank of Nigeria launched a domestic card scheme to kickstart January 2023. The scheme is aimed at unifying payments in Nigeria and promoting financial inclusion. However, the deployment of cards under this scheme has not started. As the global financial space moves to deepen financial inclusiveness and promote cashless transactions, apex banks are further moving with the tide by implementing innovative solutions for seamless transactions. Recently, a viral post shared by Oluwatofunmi Wisdom on a popular Facebook group with over 400,000 Facebook users stated that Nigerias apex bank would, on January 16, 2023, introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all other cards. Reacting to this post, Ohegam Iyoba Fruitfulness asked questions on how this will affect National Identity Cards and wondered how this move will affect his transactions. Other Facebook users in the comment thread shared the same scepticism with many questions begging for answers. The significance of this claim and the conflicting comments that have followed encouraged the need to verify this assertion and set the records straight to enlighten Nigerians. A quick google check revealed in a report that the Central Bank of Nigeria, in collaboration with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System , launched the National Domestic Card Scheme. The scheme is expected to unify payments in Nigeria and bring more unbanked Nigerians in the informal sector into the financial system. The card is also expected to rival heavyweights such as Mastercard and Visa. Nwanisobi Osita, Director of Corporate Communications at the CBN, in a statement, said, Domesticating our card scheme also enhances data sovereignty, enabling the development of locally relevant products and services and reduces demands on foreign exchange. This announcement was also reported by Premium Times , Vanguard, in October 2022 and recently by Punch and the Sun News online. In a phone interview, Emmanuel Idenyi Shaibu , a banking sector analyst, confirmed that the scheme kick-started on January 16th. However, he stated that commencement and disbursement would kickstart after the Central Bank of Nigeria agreed with the bankers committee. According to him, the new cards will not phase out the old cards. He further disclosed that the card would be independent of Visa and Mastercard while noting that the only challenge would be issues around the unified card being compromised. Emmanuel Idenyi urged Nigerians to use these unified cards when they become accessible on accounts meant for just daily transactions. Based on official statements from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the NIBSS, the new debit card scheme starts on January 16, 2023. Still, there are no confirmations about when customers will use the new cards and the current cards will cease functioning. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with Summitpost News to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"In the intricate web of global affairs, the relationship between China and Nigeria is a testament to both promise and peril. While bilateral agreements and economic ventures paint a picture of cooperation and mutual benefit, some say they pose discrimination threats. Gistlovers blog on Instagram pos ted the video of a man who claimed that there is a supermarket in Abuja where Nigerians are not allowed to shop. In the video, the man expressed annoyance as he was denied entry into the store. Wonders shall never end. There is a supermarket I saw online that is a Chinese supermarket. They have Chinese food, ramen, and other things. I wanted to go there and check it out but I was denied entry. The security officers at the gate said the supermarket was strictly for Chinese people and no Nigerian was allowed to go inside or buy anything. Is that possible in China? the man queried. Reacting to the video, Funmilayotaiwoewa wrote, Obviously, they must have something prohibited there. The government needs to inspect that place with immediate effect. Another user, iphuunanya confused about the development replied, But I have gone here now. Last year. Unless it is a new policy. Is this true? Since it was posted on Apr. 21, 2024, the video has garnered 23,553 likes, 1,841 comments, and 1826 shares. The reputation of the countries involved and the national and economic implications of the claim made DUBAWA verify the claim. DUBAWA visited the Chinese Chamber of Commerce located at Umar Musa YarAdua Road on Monday, Apr. 22, 2024. When the team entered the estate, they were led to the housing unit where the Chinese supermarket is located, but they observed the property was under lock and key. However, the team met and spoke to the Assistant Facility Manager, Sanusi Shuaibu. Mr Shuaibu stated that like other house properties in the Royal Choice estate, a housing unit was rented out to the Chinese supermarket owners about three years ago. He further discounted the public view that the estate property is owned by the Chinese supermarket owners and clarified that it is within the premises of the Royal Choice Estate, which builds and rents house properties to people. The Assistant Facility Manager then stated that while he travelled four days ago, news filtered in that the Chinese supermarket in the estate where he manages discriminated against Nigerians from purchasing products from the supermarket. No, that is not the case, The Assistant Facility Manager disagreed. If we (estate management) hear (such) information, it is either you leave or open your shop to everybody, Mr Shuaibu maintained. He disclosed that if the estate management indulges in such discriminatory behaviour, it would create an impression that they are supporting the Chinese owners with something illegal. Querying the Assistant Facility Manager who shut the Chinese supermarket, he said that it was the Chinese owners who did that. They shut (the supermarket), Mr Shuaibu disclosed. Further inquiring about his assessment of the reason the supermarket was locked, he stated that he wished that the estate management had received prior information about the whole situation. They would have apprehended the Chinese owners for an explanation. We would have held them. If you like, lock your gate, but you cannot pass the main gate, he asserted. Probing him on whether non-Chinese individuals frequent the supermarket, the Assistant Facility Manager explained that they have never stopped him from purchasing commodities from the supermarket. But they have not stopped someone like me from coming thereIf they had stopped me, then I would have investigated (for the reason) they were stopping me. Maybe I would have known their reason for stopping (Nigerians) from coming. Mr Shuaibu explained. Maybe it is (Nigerians) from outside alone. But nobody here (the estate) has said that they have ever (been stopped), he added. He told DUBAWA that customers had not visited the supermarket that day, aside from media outlets and the Department of Social Services (DSS). He further stated he had come in about eight oclock in the morning after the DSS left and met the supermarket locked. He thereafter reached out to the supermarkets owner via phone call, but it was not accessible. Asking him if the DSS left any directive for the supermarket owners to respond to the situation, the Assistant Facility Manager informed that the DSS operative ordered the owners to appear before them within 24 hours. They gave them 24 hours to show up in their office. So if they fail to come, they would use other means to find them, the Assistant Facility Manager disclosed. He also revealed that the estate management requested an order to permit them to break into the supermarket to find out why the owners do not want Nigerians in their store. He further responded to the inquiry of whether the Chinese occupied the estate. He stated that although the tenants are Chinese, Nigerians work for them. He also stated that before the incident, there had not been any report of discrimination, as Nigerians frequent the supermarket. Mr Shuaibu also disclosed that the average number of customers who patronise the supermarket is between 15 to 20 persons, most of whom are Chinese. Following a Channels Television report that the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) had visited the supermarket later that day and shut it down. DUBAWA contacted the Assistant Facility Manager to get details of the development. The Assistant Facility Manager, Mr Shuaibu, told DUBAWA that, indeed, the FCCPC had visited the supermarket and found the property still locked. However, the commission sealed the property and summoned the supermarket owners to their offices. Mr Shuaibu further disclosed that the estate management has also been summoned by the FCCPC. He disclosed that they are expected to be at the FCCPC office on Wednesday, Apr. 24, 2024, by 11 a.m. We are to come (to the FCCPC office) on Wednesday by eleven oclock in the morning, he told DUBAWA via phone call. An anonymous source, who is well informed about the matter, has divulged to DUBAWA that the security guards of Royal Choice estate are on the brink of losing their jobs over video negligence. The source relayed that their Chinese employees had told the security guards that they would be dismissed from their jobs. They are going to sack them and replace them with other people, the source informed DUBAWA. The source informed DUBAWA that the security guards were called to the office within the estate premises and told the rather worrying news. DUBAWA learned that the development stemmed from the incident that occurred on Sunday. Two Nigerians attempted to access the Chinese supermarket but were refused by the security guards they met at the estates main entrance. The source told DUBAWA that the supermarket owners were displeased with the security guards for being negligent when one of the Nigerians decided to video them refusing their entrance. The source further told DUBAWA that the security guard, who was ignorant that he was being filmed at the time, was surprised when he saw himself on social media. Upon being confronted, he told his employees that, He (did not) know. They were only just asking him the instructions that you (Chinese owners) gave to me, and that is what I told them. However, the supermarket owners refused the security guards explanations and stated that he and his other colleagues (including those who were off duty) would be sacked. Meanwhile, when DUBAWA contacted the Chief Security Officer of the estate, a job also handled by the Assistant Facility Manager, Mr Shuaibu, he claimed that he was unaware of such a development. Ongoing investigations revealed that while the Chinese owners have remained evasive to official inquiries and their property locked and sealed, they have been served a summon order by the FCCPC.",1
"Claim: Peterson Osita, a Facebook user, shared a video , purportedly showing a highway robbery in Abuja. Verdict: Misleading! Findings linked the alleged robbery scene to Botswana, not Abuja, Nigerias capital, as claimed. Recently, a video allegedly showing a robbery on an Abuja highway began to make the rounds on Facebook. As drivers slowed down for the traffic light, a gang of five robbers jumped on the road from a nearby bush. They immediately launched attacks on the vehicles using unidentifiable objects, seizing valuables. This prompted other drivers to escape by reversing their cars. The frightening moment thugs waylaid folks waiting for the traffic light to turn green in Abuja. These days, life is ugly, nasty and brutish. We all should be very vigilant and extremely careful lest we fall into, or are caught up and mired into such a situation, the claimant wrote. While there do not seem to be many comments from users, the clip has since appeared on several Facebook accounts like this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , this , and this . Through 2023, and most especially in recent weeks, the security situation of Nigerias capital, the FCT, has been under threat, with several cases of robbery and kidnapping being reported . In these moments, DUBAWA has debunked similar claims as either false or misleading. Whether true or not, a claim of this nature could increase the existing tension among residents. For that reason, DUBAWA opted to conduct this fact check. Apart from the instance under verification, DUBAWA also found that this footage was shared on Facebook in 2022 to depict a robbery scene in Kenya. We then conducted a reverse image search, and the results linked the source of this clip to a Feb. 14, 2022 announcement put out by the Botswana Police Service. In its Facebook post, the police shared a lengthier version of the footage, requesting that the public help identify a group of robbers who were wanted in connection with a robbery in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, on February 11, 2022. Findings show that the alleged robbery scene is linked to Botswana, not Abuja, as claimed.",0
"Claim: Viral links on WhatsApp claim that Peak Milk is giving customers a chance to win 100,000 after filling out a questionnaire in commemoration of its 68th anniversary. The acclaimed links giving customers of Peak Milk a chance to win 100,000 after filling a questionnaire are malicious and were created to mislead unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of fraudulent schemes. As such, this claim is False. Peak milk is a brand in the Nigerian dairy industry, produced by Friesland Campina WAMCO Nigeria Plc, under the auspices of the Royal Friesland Campina N.V. First attempt to establish the company in Nigeria began in 1954 but local production started in 1975. Since then, it has embarked on various projects to boost patronage and give back to society. In commemoration of the Christmas season in 2021, the company unveiled the Merry Peakmas campaign tagged #ShareLoveShareNourishment where winners were rewarded with Peak Milk (Nourishment) in a box and N20,000 worth of shopping vouchers. In line with this offer, different links are now circulating on WhatsApp, all claiming to give out 100,000 in commemoration of the Peak brands 68 years of operations in Nigeria. Some of the links are provided here , here , and here . When each of these links is clicked, the user is forcefully redirected to a form that requests answers to four questions: Users familiarity with Peak Milk, age, rating of service delivery and gender. Subsequently, the user is congratulated for successfully providing answers and informed to pick three boxes from an array of 12 boxes that containing different prizes. The first choice is replied as negative, while the second choice contains the 100,000 prize. To claim the prize, the user is informed to tell 5 groups or 20 friends about the promotion. After that is executed, the user address is requested to complete the registration and to deliver the supposed gift within 5-7 days. The first noticeable red flag with the website is the limited use of the brand name in the hyperlinks. A genuine link offering such information uses the brand name in the website domain name; which is the case with the original website of Peak Milk https://peakmilk.com.ng/ . Additionally, DUBAWA uncovered that the connection protocol HTTP is not encrypted . This simply implies that any information provided on such a website can be intercepted by third parties who may intend to gather data shared between the two systems. As a result, the users information can be easily hacked in comparison to an encrypted site (HTTPS). When the authenticity of the website was further analyzed on Scamvoid.net (a website that provides information about a websites reliability), findings revealed a poor trust for the page and outlines that the domain name is very recent (about 12 days ago) and traffic is low. These are also similar traits of malicious websites previously fact-checked by DUBAWA. Typical of such websites, it was discovered that neither the comments, page logo and listings were clickable. Also, all the comments available on the destination website showed that they were made minutes ago without any change, irrespective of the time the page is visited. These are forged comments that are used by fraudsters to lure unsuspecting victims. DUBAWA also discovered that the website was changed to something entirely different after a few days, making it difficult to track the details of the perpetrators. This scenario is found to be similar to previous links fact-checked by DUBAWA , which were discovered to be fraudulent, with a potential to expose users details to cybercriminals. Although Peak Milk is yet to reply to an email of inquiry sent to them as of press time, preliminary findings conducted on all the publicity channels of the company show no affiliation to the alleged link in question. The acclaimed links offering customers of Peak Milk a chance to win 100,000 after filling a questionnaire are malicious and were created to mislead unsuspecting members of the public into falling victims of fraudulent schemes. Therefore, this claim is False.",0
"Claim: An X user claims a vehicle without a complete steering wheel plying the road is linked to Nigerias popular commercial city, Lagos. Verdict: Misleading! DUBAWAs findings show that the amusing scene is linked to South Africa, not Lagos, as the X user claimed. On Sunday, Jan. 19, 2024, an X user, Uncle Chu ( @datchughuy ), shared a rather amusing video clip of a man driving a vehicle without a complete steering wheel, claiming it occurred in one of Nigerias busy commercial cities, Lagos. In the one-minute-nine-second clip, the driver seemed unperturbed about plying the road with a rather clamped metal piece as a steering wheel while other vehicle occupants cheered him. Alongside the video, the X user wrote, Nothing person never see for Lagos. This means nothing seems surprising in Lagos. As of Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025, the video had amassed about 1.5 million views, 7,110 likes, 1,681 reposts, 2,171 bookmarks, and quoted 303 times. This post ignited reactions from most other X users, who believe it was recorded in Lagos State, although a few perceived otherwise. Get him reported to relevant authorities and arrested for endangering the lives of other road users, JUSTICE! ( @Emekaelenwoke ) criticised. When you think you have seen it all. Lagos is a natural mad place, Y.A ( @yoadeoye ) remarked. This is South Africa, not Lagosright-hand driving. Not left, iPissGreatness ( @charles_Tune ) pointed out. This video has been circulated across various social media platforms. Here , here , here , and here . Given the vitality and disparity in opinions over the videos location, DUBAWA decided to verify this. DUBAWA analysed the video and noticed some details that were unrelated to Nigeria. The vehicle has a right-hand drive, meaning its steering wheel is on the right. This driving position is atypical of the Nigerian driving style as vehicles in Nigeria have their steering wheel on the left side. DUBAWA also noticed that the claimants video file sent on X is watermarked with an Instagram handle name, TSHEDIKUTUMELA . We visited the handle on IG and discovered a video clip similar to the clip shared by the claimant on X amongst the Instagram users posts. Although we could not find anything suggesting the events occurred in Nigeria, DUBAWA checked other posts that the Instagram user had shared. We noticed that he uploaded the vehicle in one of the shared posts in the claimants post and another vehicle. We checked the number plates of one of the vehicles that read HS75TVGP and ran a keyword search. We discovered that vehicles whose number plates end with GP indicate that they were registered in Gauteng Province, one of the nine provinces in South Africa. This shows that this vehicle is from South Africa, not Nigeria. The claim is false. No evidence links the video to Nigeria but South Africa.",0
"Several posts on Facebook claim that OPay is giving away N5,000 (about US$4) Ramadan seasonal gifts to its customers in Nigeria. OPay is a mobile-based financial services provider . One post, dated 1 April 2024, reads : Hurry now and get your OPay 5,000 Ramadan Gift. Click on the message down below the post to send Account Number. On 11 March 2024, Muslims around the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan, a period of fasting. During this month, friends and family often exchange gifts to celebrate. Companies also give gifts to support and strengthen their relationship with Muslim customers. The same claim about OPay Ramadan seasonal N5,000 gifts can be found here , here , here , here and here . Some of the posts ask users to click on an attached link , while others direct users to WhatsApp . But is OPay giving away the N5,000 Ramadan gifts? We checked. False claim Africa Checked searched for news about the company giving away money to celebrate Ramadan, but came up empty. This is a red flag. The site linked to in some of the posts was no longer accessible at the time of publication. Its also suspicious that a company as big as OPay would ask people to contact them via WhatsApp, as the other posts claim. Such promotions are usually run through the companys official website. We scoured OPays social media pages, including Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) , and found that it had never offered a giveaway to mark the holy month. The only Ramadan-related post is a greeting to Muslims on 11 March. We contacted OPAy on X to find out if they ran such a promotion. A company representative said: Kindly ignore such posts as OPay is not giving out any cash prizes or doing any giveaways for Ramadan.""",0
"Claim: Posts on social media are using the photos of a child whom they claim has kidney cancer, to solicit help from people. These posts are circulated by scammers with the aim of defrauding unsuspecting donors. The story of Miss Hubert Ikoi Nkanu came to the public after information about her condition was shared on the internet in 2018. Born medically fit and sound, Huberts parents, who are based in Calabar, Cross River State, said they were worried when they noticed that her stomach was growing unusually bigger, sometime in 2017. We observed that her stomach started growing big and she was also losing weight, Nkanu Okoi, her father recalled. It made us very worried, so later we took her for a scan at Asi Ukpo Diagnostics to find out what was wrong. Diagnosis after a Computed Tomography (CT) scan revealed that Hubert, aged 2 at the time, had Nephroblastoma with metastasis to the lungs. Also known as Wilms tumor, Nephroblastoma is a rare kidney cancer that primarily affects children aged 2 to 5. It occurs mostly in one kidney, but can sometimes be found in both kidneys at the same time. We did not have money for her medical care and she was going through lots of pain, so we started looking for help, Nkanu said. The family made videos and pictures of the ailing child and the medical report, which were circulated on news websites and social media , soliciting donations from members of the public. Donations were requested to be made to the Sterling Bank Account of Vital Signs with Account Number 0065009571. Hubert has since recovered after surgery and other medical treatments. Her father said she now attends school and is doing well. But in 2021, pictures and videos of Hubert before her treatment resurfaced on the internet, but with a different name and a different bank account details, in posts seeking financial donations for her surgery and medical treatments. The posts have been widely shared between May and August by many social media users , bloggers and influencers , including ex-Big Brother Nigeria housemate, Ike Onyema . Dubawa found that the recently circulated posts seeking help with the girls photos are scams. In an interview with Dubawa, Nkanu Okoi, father of the girl in all the photos, revealed that his daughters real name is Hubert Okoi Nkanu. This implies that all the posts using the girls photos and/or videos with different names, such as Beatrice or Beatrice Alimi , are fake. Mr. Nkanu also said that the posts did not emanate from him or his family, adding that the bank account details attached to the posts (Wema Bank, Fidelis Alimi Agbahi, 7810604013), are scams, which suggest a ploy to defraud unsuspecting members of the public. He confirmed that his daughter was diagnosed with Nephroblastoma in 2018, after they took her for a scan, due to an unusual swelling of her stomach. We spent all our money, borrowed money, and even had to sell my shares in Zenith bank to get money, but it was not enough, he said. He said they found hope when they met the CEO of Vital Signs and Ayade Care Home Health Services, Calabar, Dr. Genevive Barnaby, who advised and assisted them to reach out to the public, to help raise the money needed for their daughters treatment. They made videos and uploaded pictures of the girl and the medical report, which were shared on social media to solicit for donations. She was referred to the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, where doctors prescribed surgery and 21 weeks of chemotherapy, which was pegged at Nine Hundred Thousand Naira (N900,000). Although a total sum of N800,000 was donated, Mr. Nkanu said Dr. Barnaby only remitted N75,000 to the family. He said his daughters case got the attention of the doctors at the UCTH Doctors Welfare unit, who facilitated her treatment, surgery and chemotherapy, free of charge. He confirmed that Hubert recovered after the surgery and had since started school. We spent 6 months at UCTH for the surgery and treatment, after which my daughter recovered. This happened 3 years ago. She has been attending school. I was surprised when I saw those old photos and videos online again with posts asking for money, he said. My daughters name is Hubert Okoi Nkanu and not Beatrice Alimi. It is a scam. Hale and Hearty: A recent photo of Hubert Okoi Nkanu Edu Ele, a social worker who is close to the Nkanu family, said the scam had received wide attention due to the large followership of celebrities and influencers who had shared the posts. With their posts on those celebrities pages, its spreading like wildfire, she said. She has engaged a campaign on twitter and instagram to draw attention of the public to the scam, and has tried to get celebrities and influencers to take down the posts. Dubawa found many burner accounts, including one in the fake name Beatrice Alimi , which are involved in perpetuating the scam. While some made the posts, others were in comment sections, cajoling people to make donations. Screenshot of comments section showing one of the fake accounts cajoling users for donations One of the posters even claimed to be the little girl Beatrice Alimis uncle and the person who has been taking care of her since she was diagnosed with the illness a claim that Dubawa has confirmed to be false. Dubawa has found that the real name of the girl in the photos circulated on social media is Hubert Okoi Nkanu. Every post carrying the same photo but identifying her with a different name is fake. It was also discovered that the girl in the photos, Hubert, was diagnosed with nephroblastoma 3 years ago, but has since recovered and is now in good health. Those circulating her photos and seeking donations for her medical treatment recently, are fraudsters.",1
"Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate, delivered a presentation on Monday, January 16, 2023, at Chatham House in the United Kingdom (UK), speaking on how he intends to govern Nigeria if elected as president in next months election. Themed Nigerias 2023 elections: A vision for policy change and institutional reforms, Mr Obi spoke and answered questions on issues ranging from poverty, education, economy, energy, oil and gas, insecurity, and restructuring.

Verification: The total number of out-of-school children in Nigeria is estimated at 20 million, according to the latest globa l data on out-of-school children published in September 2022 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). Therefore, Mr Obis claim that northern Nigeria accounts for 20 million out-of-school children is false. Verdict: False Source: UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM) and Premium Times report. Claim: Seven local governments of Niger State are under the control of Bandits. Last year, the Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, revealed that seven out of the 25 local governments in the state are frequently under attack by bandits and terrorists. Multiple newspapers also reported that seven local governments of Niger state are under constant attack by bandits. Verdict: True Source: Thisday and The Punch newspaper. Claim: Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in 2015 was $2,550. Verification: World Banks data review shows that Nigerias GDP per capita in 2015 stood at $2,679, contradicting Mr Obis claim. Verdict: False. Source: World Bank Claim: Nigerias total health budget was below N2.5 trillion from 2015 2021. Verification: A review of Nigerias health budget from 2015 2021 shows that the federal government allocated N2.50 trillion to the health sector. Verdict: Inaccurate. Source: Budget office of the Federation , Premium Times and The Punch newspaper Claim: As of 2015, Nigerias total debt stock is about N15 trillion. But today (January 2023), with CBN ways and means, we owe over N75 trillion, Mr Obi claimed. Verification: Nigerias public debt in December 2015 stood at N12.6 trillion, according to official data from Nigerias Debt Management Office . By September 2022, the Nigerian governments domestic and foreign debts rose to N44 trillion. On the other hand, the CBNs loans to the federal government stood at N23.8 trillion cumulatively. Therefore, Nigerias total debt combined with CBNs loans is N67.8 trillion, not over N75 trillion, as claimed by Mr Obi. Verdict: False. Source: Debt Management Office and Premium Times.",1
"Claim: An Instagram user, Dr Daryl Gioffre, claims corn contains 25 forms of aflatoxins, a cancer-causing fungus/mould. Verdict: True. The claim that corn can contain cancer-causing aflatoxins is true. This is said to occur naturally, but poor post-harvest handling increases the likelihood of contamination. Corn or maize is a popular snack among Nigerians. Whether boiled, roasted, or turned into various treats, corn is versatile and transcends socioeconomic boundaries and seasons. Its affordability and wide availability, particularly during the rainy season, make it a beloved food staple nationwide. While corn is a common snack many enjoy, most Nigerians may not give much thought to the type or quality of corn they consume. On Sept. 5, 2024, an Instagram user, Dr Daryl Gioffre, posted a video , with the caption, How old were you when you found out that corn actually contains 25 aflatoxins, which are cancer-causing fungus/moulds? As of Oct. 10, 2024, the post had garnered over 53,000 likes. Mr Gioffres claim raises concerns about the potential health risks. DUBAWA decided to investigate this because of public health safety. Verification According to the National Cancer Institute, Aflatoxins are a group of toxins produced by fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, commonly found on crops such as maize, peanuts, cottonseed, and tree nuts. According to the National Cancer Institute, these fungi thrive in warm and humid climates and can contaminate crops both in the field and during harvest and storage. Humans are exposed to aflatoxins primarily by consuming contaminated plant-based products or animal-derived products, such as meat and dairy, from livestock fed with contaminated feed. Agricultural workers may also be at risk by inhaling dust generated during the handling and processing of these crops. Long-term exposure to aflatoxins poses significant health risks. According to Biomedcentral , Aflatoxin B1 is the most dangerous of the aflatoxins, it is highly carcinogenic and has been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer. The carcinogenic effect of aflatoxins, particularly AFB1, is intensified in individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Aflatoxins have also been associated with other types of cancer and organ damage, especially to the liver and kidneys. In addition to their carcinogenic effects, aflatoxins are mutagenic, meaning they can alter DNA, and are genotoxic, which could potentially cause birth defects, as noted by Ambiotec Solutions . They also suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections like HIV or tuberculosis. Prolonged exposure can lead to immunosuppression, compromising the bodys ability to fight off diseases. Acute exposure to high levels of aflatoxins can cause aflatoxicosis, a potentially fatal condition due to severe liver damage. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that large doses of aflatoxins can lead to immediate death, while long-term exposure to smaller doses may result in immune system impairment or nutritional deficiencies. In summary, aflatoxins are potent toxins that pose severe health risks, ranging from liver cancer to immune suppression, and require careful management to minimise human exposure. A dietician, Emmanuel Oyebamiji of the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, confirmed the presence of aflatoxins in corn, emphasising the health risks associated with poor post-harvest practices. Although he could not confirm the exact levels of aflatoxin in corn, Mr Oyebamiji noted that maize often contains no fewer than 20 parts per billion (ppb) of the harmful toxin. Mr Oyebamiji said the presence of aflatoxins is closely linked to poor sanitation practices during harvesting and post-harvest handling. It occurs naturally, but poor handling exacerbates the problem, Mr Oyebamiji explained. Farmers should ensure that maize is harvested at moisture levels between 20% and 30%. When properly handled and the seed is not broken, aflatoxin cannot develop. Contamination often results from wet or contaminated packaging materials. He further warned that cooking methods like roasting or boiling are insufficient to eliminate aflatoxins. Some people believe that cooking reduces aflatoxin levels, but it doesnt kill the toxin, only reduces it. Aflatoxin is a known risk factor for cancer. To prevent contamination, he recommended stringent sanitation practices for equipment and storage facilities. The first step is cleaning all harvesting, handling, and drying equipment, as well as storage bins, to remove any broken corn, dust, or foreign materials that could cause contamination. Farmers should also ensure storage bins are repaired to prevent moisture leaks and use approved insecticides to treat storage areas. A medical doctor, Omobolanle Braihmoh, highlighted the dangers of consuming food with 25 parts per billion of harmful toxins, emphasising that it poses a significant risk for diseases and fungal infections. She explained that consuming foods intended for cooking in their raw state can lead to health complications. No food meant for cooking should be consumed raw by humans. While some farmers argue that eating food raw retains more nutrients, the risk of fungal infection is high when foods meant to be cooked are consumed raw, she said. The claim that corn can contain cancer-causing aflatoxins is true. Aflatoxins, which are produced by fungi, pose serious health risks, including liver cancer, immune suppression, and even death. Poor post-harvest handling increases the likelihood of contamination, and cooking methods such as boiling or roasting do not totally eliminate the toxins.",1
"Claim: An X user claimed that Governor Sanwo-Olu had increased the minimum wage from N35,000 to N70,000. Verdict: False! Findings show that the Lagos state governors video does not depict an increase in the minimum wage of state workers but an increase in the wage allowance. In Nigeria, the rising inflation and the present economic hardships faced by the countrys populace have prompted a continuous call for a new minimum wage review for civil servants. With the current national minimum wage set at N30,000, many argue it needs more due to rising inflation. These expectations on the minimum wage have been expressed through the labour unions in the country, with the NLC president generating some controversy for calling for an increment of up to a million naira . During the zonal public hearings in Lagos, Kano, Enugu, Akwa Ibom, Adamawa, and Abuja, workers in the North-West requested N485,000, North-East, N560,000; north-central, N709,000 (NLC); N447,000 (TUC); south-west, N794,000; South-South, N850.000; and South-East, N540,000 by NLC and N447,000 by TUC. While these conversations unfold, some state governors have expressed concerns about their ability to pay a higher minimum wage without a review of the national revenue-sharing formula. There remain some implementation delays by states that have yet to fully implement the current minimum wage of N30,000. There has also been speculation about implementing a new minimum wage by May 2024. In addition, an X user @_callmebekky, on April 25, 2024, claimed in a post that Governor Sanwo Olu had increased the minimum wage of Civil servants in the state to N70,000. The post had an attached video of Governor Sanwo Olu addressing an audience to bolster the claim made. The posts caption reads, Governor Sanwo-Olu has increased the minimum wage from 35,000 Naira to 70,000 Naira As of April 27, 2024, the post had been viewed over 225,000 times, generating over 1,500 likes, 648 retweets, and 215 comments on the social media platform X. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed excitement and disbelief. An X user, @udeochusp , wrote: Gooooooaaal. Up Lagos, while @MayJaYBaE wrote, This is impressive. Should be done in all the states, too. Another user, @_khay_O , expressing disbelief, wrote: At what point did he mention that minimum wage has been increased? Why do we thrive with misinformation so much? Having observed the various reactions and engagement generated by the post and its virality on other platforms such as TikTok, Instagram , and other news platforms , DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. We listened to excerpts from the video the Lagos State Governor shared on Wednesday, April 24, 2024, at the Lagos House, Alausa, Ikeja, during the flag-off of the Eko Cares Initiative. It reads thus, By the grace of God, very soon, we will see a new minimum wage that will be approved for the federal and state governments. The civil servants and all public officers know that since January, we have continued to pay the minimum wage allowance of N35,000, over and above what they earned. If they are not saying it, let us say it. So it means that people earning a minimum of N35,000, N40,000, theyve now been earning N70,000. Thats what theyve been enjoying since January. The statements first line depicts the governors futuristic reference to an increment in the minimum wage, which still needs to be implemented. The Lagos state commissioner of information and strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, also clarified that no minimum wage increment has happened. A press statement by the Lagos state commissioner of information and strategy, Gbenga Omotoso, via his official X handle , also states: Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has been erroneously quoted as saying that a new minimum wage of N70,000 had been announced. This is wrong. Mr. Governor never said so. He said that since January, civil servants have been earning the N35,000 wage award directed by the federal government. In other words, those earning N35,000 now earn N70,000. He did not announce a new minimum wage of N70,000. Giving further clarification on the issue of the mix-up of the wage award and a new minimum wage by some members of the Governors speech, the Vice Chairman of NLC Lagos State Council, Olabisi Adebayo Idowu added that negotiations on a new minimum wage were still ongoing. He said: We are still waiting for the salary increase, and negotiation is going on between the Labor centers. Our findings show that the claim that the Lagos state governor announced an increase in the minimum wage of civil servants in Lagos from 35,000 Naira to 70,000 Naira is untrue.

"Just In: DANGOTE CEMENT NOW N2,700 FROM 1st OCTOBER, 2023. Dangote crashes Cement Price from 5500 to 2700. Aliko Dangote has announced the new price of Cement crashed by 50%, from October 1st, from N5500 to N2700, reads an Instagram post . Dangote Cement Plc is one of Africas largest cement manufacturers headquartered in Lagos, Nigeria. It is a subsidiary of Dangote Group, which was founded by billionaire Aliko Dangote . The post has attracted more than 1,300 likes and 170 comments. We found similar claims on Facebook here , here , here and here , and on Instagram here , here , here , here and here . But has Dangote Cement slashed the price of cement? We checked. In August 2023, the company told the media that the price of cement was between N4,010 and N4,640. It also clarified that a bag of cement could cost up to N5,300 when transportation costs were included. Dangote Group also denied the social media claim, with its spokesperson Anthony Chiejine labelling it fake news.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claims that the FBI has arrested 80 Nigerians after being trailed for years for criminal activities in the state Verdict: Misleading . Although the FBI arrested a group of Nigerians in connection with international fraud, money laundering, credible news outlets reported the incident happened in 2019. In recent years, there has been growing concern over Nigerians increasing involvement in fraudulent activities abroad, a trend that has cast a shadow on the reputation of the countrys diaspora. Recently, a Facebook user, Comrade Phils , shared a video and alleged that the FBI arrested 80 Nigerians living abroad after being under surveillance for years due to their involvement in criminal activities in the U.S. According to the video, the defendants were part of a large-scale global fraud scheme with far-reaching implications. The video further claimed that these individuals were responsible for defrauding 1,000 people in Los Angeles, resulting in a loss of $73 million. Paul Delacourt, an FBI assistant director featured in the video, explained that the bureau received 14,000 victim complaints. The criminals allegedly used hacked email accounts to deceive businesses and individuals into making payments. The post shared on Saturday, Sept. 22, 2024, has garnered around 1,800 views, 25 likes, and eight comments. Most users who saw the Facebook post expressed no doubt about its authenticity. However, DUBAWA decided to verify the posts authenticity to curtail the spread of disinformation. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search using the phrase 80 Nigerians arrested by the FBI and discovered that the incident occurred in 2019. DUBAWA found that several credible news outlets, including This Day , Premium Times and Vanguard , reported the story. According to This Day , a United States federal grand jury indicted 80 individuals, mostly Nigerians, for their involvement in a significant international fraud and money laundering conspiracy. These individuals were accused of targeting victims through schemes such as business email compromise and romance scams. However, all the news outlets earlier mentioned published the report in 2019. Although it is true that the FBI arrested 80 individuals, mostly Nigerians, for their involvement in international fraud, the incident happened in 2019.",1
"Claim: The doctor-to-patient ratio under George Weah is one to 20,000, according to Activist Martin Kollie. Verdict: False! The post from Activist Martin Kollie stating that the Doctor-to-Patient ratio in Liberia under George Weah is one to 20,000 contradicts the Liberia Medical and Dental Council (LMDC) statistic that the country has a total of 920 doctors, which means the ratio mathematically is one doctor to 5,000 citizens. Activist Martin Kollie, in one of his regular Facebook posts dated January 3, 2023, quoted the WHO that the Doctor-to-Patient Ratio should be 1 to 1,000. He added that under George Manneh Weah, the narrative is worrying. According to him, at the moment in Liberia, there is one doctor for 20,000 patients, citing the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report as his source. He said, It was 1 to 15,000 under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Yall go and put Jorweah there again. It will go up to 1 to 50,000. Crisis!! Activist Martin Kollie, who posted the statement on January 4, 2022, on his official Facebook page , has sparked public debate among Facebook users. Some Facebook users agreed with Kollie over his claim, while others branded the post as political and false. Liberias fragile health sector has been exposed on two different occasions, both in 2014 and 2019. The former was due to the deadly Ebola virus outbreak leading to the deaths of scores of citizens. The country reported the highest number of Ebola cases in the West African region. Though Liberia has been declared free of Ebola, its adverse effects remain fresh in the minds of ordinary people. Hit by the global Covid-19 in 2020, the nation, as of January 11 (2023), recorded a total number of 294 deaths and total confirmed cases at 8,043 . Like other nations of the world, COVID also affected the cost of living for ordinary Liberians. With the challenges associated with the health implications mentioned above, we decided to verify the claim by activist Martin Kollie on his official Facebook page. The doctor-to-patient ratio refers to the number of available doctors per every 10,000 inhabitants in a population, in a given year, for a given country, territory, or geographic area. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a one to 1,000 doctor-to-patient ratios for adequate healthcare service. With this recommendation from the WHO, it is critical to examine the truth behind the claim. Activist Kollie, in his statement, specifically referenced the 2021/2022 Health Workforce (HWF report) as his source. But, online research for the 2021/2022 HWF report seems inaccessible. This researcher reached out to the WHO local office to access the report, but it was not provided despite many efforts. However, the WHO, according to an official working with the Ministry of Health, Chester Smith, the global health institution, does not release such national data to individuals. The World Health Organization measurement method concerning data collection is often drawn from its country offices based on information reported by the national health authority. However, the national health authority in Liberia, charged with feeding the WHO with national data, rubbished the claim. The Deputy Minister for Planning and Research at the Ministry of Health, A. Vaifee Tulay, said that on record, there are 920 medical doctors currently in Liberia, contrary to the claim from Kollie. Statistically, when one measures the above number of Medical doctors against the nations estimated 4.8 million population, you will have the figure of about 5,000 patients to 1 Doctor, A. Vaifee Tulay noted. When asked about the WHO 2021/2022 HWF report, Deputy Minister Tulay maintained that such a report has not reached his desk, Not to my knowledge, maybe it is on its way. Interestingly, when contacted, Kollie, who claimed to have gathered his information from the World Health Organization HWF, backpedalled on his previous source. As indicated below, the claimant referred DUBAWA to the Liberia Medical and Dental Council report. Our examination revealed that the latest data released by the Liberia Medical and Dental Council on the number of doctors in the country says otherwise. The total number of Liberian doctors is 917; of the 917, 407 had been active from 2020/2022 while others had passed, others retired from practising, and others were not coming to renew their license. So we have 510 that fall in this category, said the Liberia Medical Dental Council report. On the number of foreign doctors practising and visiting Liberia, the report states that there are 1,170 foreign doctors registered with the Medical Council. Of the 1,170, only 517 had been active since 2020. Most of the rest have returned without knowledge of the council while others also passed, said the Liberia Medical and Dental Council. But in 2016, the Medical and Dental Council, under President Sirleafs administration, released a report that came close to the claimants position on the doctor-to-patient ratio in Liberia. We cannot guarantee whether this report, released eight years ago, was reliable because the author failed to cite the particular year. Online research brought DUBAWA closer to this 2016 Liberia Medical and Dental report referenced by Yale . The Liberia Medical Dental Council, among other things, noted that the total number of Medical doctors who are currently with the Council from 2020/2022 is 924, a figure that slightly contradicts the Deputy Minister of Health, who put the total number of doctors in Liberia at 920. Given the nature of such a claim and the lack of evidence to back it, the claim is deemed false. In view of the fact that there are between 920 and 947 medical doctors to 4.8 million citizens, a ratio of one doctor to 5,000 patients, the claim by Maerin Kollie that the doctor-patient ratio in Liberia is one to 20,000 is false. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: UBA embroiled in N1.9 billion fraud Scandal Verdict : Insufficient Evidence. While there are reports about fraud allegations with UBAs Chairman, Tony Elumelu, which he later denied and demanded an apology, theres no evidence that UBA fraudulently moved N1.9 billion belonging to the Pension Fund Administrator. An online website , holisticinfo.com, claimed that 1.9 billion Naira belonging to a Pension Fund Administrator was fraudulently moved from the treasury of the United Bank for Africa (UBA). The blog claimed that UBA has one of the weakest security systems in terms of the safety of customers funds in their custody. Investigations revealed that the money was moved out from the UBA Treasury account in five tranches between March 25, 2020 to 5 June 5, 2020. The first four tranches of the fraudulent transaction were over N400 million each, while the last one, which took place in June, was N200 million plus. The over N1.9 billion was moved from the Pension Fund Administrators account (PFA), PAL Pensions Alliance. Its worthy of note that between March 25 and June 5, when these monies were moved from UBA coffers, the bank did not even notice until July ended. It was the IRT detectives who called UBAs attention to the fraud. This is a testament to the banks weak and vulnerable security system, part of the post reads. The claimant asserts that three UBA Treasury Staff members, Osita Omeje, Dirisu Sunday, and Nappy Aiyegbusi, authorised the fraud. Due to the claims veracity, DUBAWA opted for verification to establish the truth. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on Google to see if any reputable media outlet had reported it but found none. However, in the course of our Investigation, we discovered a media report where the chairman of UBA, Tony Elumelu, denied the allegation of N41bn fraud and demanded an apology from the accused. We checked through the work history of Nappy Ngbale Aiyegbusi, one out of the three names mentioned by the blog to be UBAs staff but we couldnt find any information linking her to UBA. DUBAWA further reached out to the UBA for a reaction but we are yet to receive their response. Based on available information, theres no evidence that N1.9 billion was fraudulently moved from the Pension Fund Administrators account (PFA), PAL Pension Alliance by UBA.",1
"Claim: A viral screenshot claims President Buhari said he is not aware of the ongoing ASUU strike President Muhammadu Buhari did not say he is unaware of ASUUs strike action because our findings and analysis show that the viral screenshot was manipulated. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on February 14, 2022, embarked on a four-week warning strike which was extended by two months to afford the government more time to address all of its demands. The major demands of ASUU are; the renegotiation of its ASUU-FG 2009 agreement and the deployment of University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) for payment of its members salaries. On Thursday May 5, 2022, a screenshot went viral with the claim that president Muhammadu Buhari said he is not aware of the strike action. The news story was said to be published the same day by World Of News. The alleged report read I dont know ASUU is on strike since when and how long, nobody ever told me ASUU is on strike, Buhari says. First of all, there is no news platform with the name World Of News. Looking at the screenshot, we observed that the byline had no name, just a combination of letters and numbers (kqce4), which is unlike an ideal news story. A keyword search did not lead to any news report on this claim or anything related. We, however, found reports by the Guardian , Premium Times , noting the minister of labour, Chris Ngige, updated the president on the deliberations and progress regarding the strike action. This clearly shows the president is aware even though he has remained silent on the issue even at the recent Workers Day celebration where he was represented by the Vice President, Yemi Osibanjo. Also, analysis of the image on Forensically shows the image had been manipulated. Error level analysis shows the byline, date and text of the story show they were typed over another. Secondly, the image carries the three colour frames that indicate manipulation. Clone detection also reveals different manipulation done on the image. President Muhammadu Buhari did not say he is unaware of ASUUs strike action because our findings and analysis show the screenshot was manipulated and no news report carried the claim. It is also remarkable that news reports in the past have shown the president is aware of the strike action, given that he is usually updated.",1
"Claim: An X user, Morris Monye claims that Akpabio was praying inside Abuja National Mosque. Verdict: Misleading! Findings show that Akpabio was inside the Abuja Mosque for Senator Danjuma Gojes daughters wedding. There have been a lot of questions about whether Muslims can enter the Church or Christians can enter Mosques. Such inquiries can be seen here , here , and here . Amidst this, an X user, @Morris_Monye , posted an image with a caption alleging that the Nigeria Senate President, Godwills Akpabio, was praying inside the Abuja National Mosque. The claimant suggests that it was a political move. Politics!!!!! See Akpabio praying inside Mosque, the post reads. As of Oct. 26, 2024, the post had garnered over 2,800 likes, 688 reposts, and 406 comments. Hety Erabhahiemen, Reacting to the post, Hety Erabhahiemen commented , Funny enough that this Muslim counterpart will not go to church for this type of eye service. These guys dont have conscience again, Lucy Nkem reacted . Emmy Steven also commented , These guys have no allegiance to religion. Na where belly face. DUBAWA understands how misinformation can fuel religious violence, so we found it necessary to verify and establish the truth. Verification DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search on the image posted by the claimant using Google Lens and discovered media reports on the same image. According to a report , Senate President Godwills Akpabio was among the dignitaries who attended the wedding Fatiha of Senator Danjuma Gojes daughter on Friday, Oct. 25, 2024. Mr Goje is the senator representing Gombe Central and a former governor of Gombe state. The report shows that Fauziyya Danjuma Goje and Aliyu Ahmed Abubakars wedding Fatiha was held at the National Mosque, Abuja, after the two Rakaat Jumaat prayers. This shows that Akpabio entered the Mosque only to attend the wedding, after the prayer. In further research, we retrieved a YouTube video of Premium Times coverage of the event. We thoroughly examined it and found that Godswill Akpabio wasnt around throughout the two Rakaat Jumaat prayers but entered only after it was time for the wedding of Fatiha. The claim that Senator Godswill Akpabio was praying at Abuja National Mosque is misleading! Media reports show that the senate president was there for a wedding ceremony, not prayers.",0
"Claim: Multiple Facebook users claim Divine Ikubor, known as Rema, is Ghanaian. Verdict: Rema once lived and worked in Ghana but has no biological ties to the African country. On the contrary, he is a Nigerian, born to the Late Justice Ikubor, former Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benin, Edo state capital. The claim that he is a citizen of Ghana is false. The Nigerian music industry has taken a high place in the international entertainment arena, with its famous stars making extraordinary waves on the global stage. In 2022, the Afrobeat star Davido, David Adeleke, showcased his musical prowess during Qatars FIFA World Cup finals. Fast-forward to May 2023, Tiwatope Savage-Balogun, the talented Tiwa Savage, graced the stage at the coronation of King Charles III. Adding to this narrative is Divine Ikubor, recognised as Rema, who made history in Oct. 2023 with a captivating performance at the prestigious Ballon dOr ceremony in Paris, France. His participation marked a personal milestone and served as a source of immense pride for the Nigerian community. However, after Remas groundbreaking performance, a claim surfaced on Facebook, asserting that the Afrowave maestro hails from Ghana. This unexpected twist has sparked discussions, adding an intriguing layer to Remas remarkable journey. The post read: Heres Ghanaian international artist Rema Appiah making all Africans proud in France. Ghana to the World. Initially shared by Raggaemarley Chelsea , the post garnered 223,000 likes. This claim has spread on Facebook, surfacing in multiple places and sparking controversial engagements as seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . DUBAWA conducted this verification due to the viral nature of the assertion. Aside from the sensationalism of the statement, DUBAWA observed the name discrepancy in the post. While Remas real name is Divine Akubor, the post alleged he was Rema Appiah. We therefore conducted a keyword search on Google, revealing multiple articles that linked Remas place of origin to Benin, Edo state, located in the South-South of Nigeria. Born to the Late Justice Ikubor , a top-ranking member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo state, Rema spent most of his childhood in Benin. Life, however, took a difficult turn for the church boy after he lost his father in 2008. Reflecting on his journey in an interview with Capital Xtra , a UK-based hip hop radio station, he had to be agile, forcing him to Cotonu, from where he later relocated to Ghana to work at a bar beach. He returned to Nigeria in 2017, two years before his music career fully picked up. The Rema incident is just a glimpse into a recurring trend that highlights Ghanaians tendency to lay claim to successful Nigerians. In June 2023, emotional footage surfaced, purportedly featuring two Ghanaian women passionately asserting that Mercy Johnson , a famous Nigerian actress, is their estranged sister who abandoned them after achieving wealth. Following Tiwa Savages performance at the King Charles III coronation in May 2023, rumours circulated that the Nigerian female singer was, in fact, Ghanaian. This pattern continued when Hilda Baci, the Guinness World Record holder, was falsely claimed to be from Ghana, prompting former Minister of Education Obiageli Ezekwesili to express her concern at the rising phenomenon. Adding to the list of mistaken identities, Nana Otedola, wife of Nigerian billionaire Femi Otedola, took to TikTok in December 2023 to dispel persistent claims that she hails from Ghana. Despite the seemingly serious nature of these claims, a subtle inside joke exists, with Nigerians reciprocating by claiming Ghanaians during moments of success and vice versa. Additionally, there are instances where, in jest, individuals are gifted to another country when they do not perform well, as illustrated in the following scenario: Screenshot of Nigerians jokingly exchanging their celebrities with Ghanaians on X. Contrary to the viral claim, our findings revealed that Rema has no citizenship connection with Ghana. His father, Late Justice Ikubor, was a former chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benin, Edo state.",0
"Claim: Nigeria spent N3.63 trillion on debt servicing between January and December 2022. Verdict: Missing context. While Nigeria paid off N3.63 trillion debt in 2022, the countrys total public debt stock has risen to N46.25 trillion ($103.11 billion), according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO). A few weeks to the end of his second-term presidential bid, President Muhammadu Buhari and his communications team have spoken highly of the administrations achievements. Recall that in December 2022, during a meeting with the Secretary General of the Abu Dhabi Forum, Sheikh Al-Mahfoudh Bin Bayyah, and his deputy, Pastor Bob Roberts of the United States, Mr Buhari said he had tried his best to solve Nigerias challenges as president. In a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), Mr Buhari said, We will continue to solve our problems, especially as they relate to the youth. We are big in size and population, facing many challenges, but in many areas, we are trying. In seven-and-a-half years, I have done my best. He also reiterated the claim in January 2023 when he noted that he had served Nigeria to the best of his ability, emphatically stating that he had not disappointed anyone. There have also been documented cases of cabinet members speaking highly of the administration to play down criticisms of his achievements by opposition members, as can be seen here and here . During the presidential election campaign, the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, promised to build on the current administrations legacy. Supporters of Mr Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) on social media are also not left behind. They have continually taken to their pages to extol Mr Buharis achievements. One of them is a Twitter user Imran Wakili Oluwafemi @IU_Wakilli who has consistently praised the president in his tweets, here , here , and here . On April 10 2023, the user tweeted that Nigeria paid off N3.63 trillion debt between January and December 2022, wondering why such news about Mr Buhari would not trend. As of the time of writing this report, the tweet had been viewed more than 298,000 times. Some Nigerians have questioned the claims authenticity, urging DUBAWA to conduct a fact-check. Nigerians and other economic experts have expressed concern over the countrys rising debt profile under Mr Buharis administration. The outgoing president has been severely criticised for his administrations penchant for loans, particularly external ones. An analysis by Premium Times shows that external debt under Mr Buhari has grown three times more than the combined figure recorded by the past three administrations. While the Obasanjo government met $28 billion as foreign debt in 1999, it left $2.11 billion in 2007 after successfully securing a write-off by the London and Paris clubs of foreign creditors. The Yaradua/Jonathan government added $1.39 billion to what they met. The Jonathan government also incurred an additional $3.8 billion, taking the countrys total foreign debt to $7.3 billion when that administration ended in 2015. Nigerias external loan reached $28.57 billion by December 2020, meaning an extra $21.27 billion had been accumulated under the Buhari administration three times the combined amount by past governments since 1999. While the Nigerian government consistently explained the loans were to help facilitate the execution of some projects, critics opined that the loans could compromise the countrys sovereignty. According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), external debt burdens expose developing countries like Nigeria to higher risk profiles of debt contracts, for example, shorter maturities and more volatile financing costs as to sudden reversals of private capital inflows. It also noted that external debt burdens deemed sustainable by international creditors could quickly become unsustainable for developing nations in cases of unforeseen contingencies. Meanwhile, a report by Cogent Economical and Finance noted that public debts (both domestic and external) could have positive impacts on the economy of the debtor nation. The authors argued that domestic debt significantly impacted long-term growth while its short-term effect was negative. On the other hand, external debt constituted an impediment to long-term growth, while its short-term effect was growth-enhancing. Conclusively, the study suggested that the government should direct the borrowed funds to the diversification of the productive base of the economy. Data from the Debt Management Office (DMO) showed that Nigeria spent $2.4 billion on servicing external debt from January to December 2022. The Central Bank of Nigerias exchange rate of US$1 to NGN448.08 was used to convert the $2.4 to N1.07 trillion. The country paid off $618.6 million on servicing multilateral debts from the International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development, African Development Fund, Africa Growing Together Fund, International Development Association, European Development Fund, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the Islamic Development Bank. On Bilateral debts, the country spent $336.5 million and $1.45 billion for Commercial debts within the same period. On Domestic Debt servicing, FG repaid N668.6 billion from January to March 2022, N664.7 billion from April to June, N820.5 billion from July to September and N406.7 billion from October to December 2022. The FG spent N2.56 trillion on domestic debt servicing from January to December 2022. However, the total public debt stock of both the Federal and state government(s) stood at N46.25 trillion ($103.11 billion) at the end of December 2022, according to data from the DMO. While the Domestic Debt Stock was N27.55 trillion, the external debt stock was N18.70 trillion. This significantly increased from N39.56 trillion ($95.77 billion) in December 2021. The breakdown showed that the Federal Government s share of the Domestic Debt Stock was N22.2 trillion, while that of the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory stood at N5.3 trillion. The data shows that the country indeed paid off N3.63 trillion in domestic and external debt stock as of December 2022. Still, available records showed the country incurred another extra debt of N6.69 trillion between January to December of the same year, going by the difference between the total debt stock at the end of 2021 and 2022. In a press release issued on March 30, 2023, the DMO explained that the debt stock had increased due to new borrowings by the Federal and state governments to fund budget deficits and execute projects. Although the Nigerian government spent N3.63 trillion on debt servicing from January to December 2022, data from the DMO showed that the country acquired an extra N6.69 trillion in debt within the same period. The Twitter user who made a claim had not given sufficient information.",1
"Claim: A TikTok video shows Kylian Mbappe supposedly talking in an interview about former teammate, Neymar Santos (Jnr)s ego. Verdict: False. Findings reveal that the video has been altered, as the original video shows Kylian Mbappe telling CBS Sports in 2023 of his intention to remain in PSG amongst other things . In the past, former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) forward Neymar Santos (Jnr.) has been in the tabloids for his seemingly arrogant display on and off the football pitch. In 2023, the Brazilian star transferred to Saudi Arabia side Al Hilal after six seasons at Parc des Princes. Over a year later, a Tiktok video claims former PSG teammate and French star Kylian Mbappe, spoke about Mr Santos ego and how it is responsible for his shortcomings at Camp Nou and Parc Des Princes You dont have to compare Neymar with me. Because he could have achieved so much in football. But the problem was his ego, he always wanted to be the centre of attention, Mr Mbappe allegedly said. When he was at Barcelona, he was always in Messis shadows. He moved to PSG, and uhm, he didnt get any better because he only found himself in my shadow. So it was probably the reason he left for Saudi Arabia. He continued The video has also been posted on YouTube . As of Wednesday, May 22, 2024, the TikTok post has attracted over 72,000 likes and 299 comments, bookmarked 3,628 times, and shared 555 times. Although some application users reacted to the video by thinking it contained traces of artificial intelligence, some swallowed the integrity of the post hook, line, and sinker. Is that Mbappes voice? Mb___Max asked. You cant be in Neymars shoes. You are so good, thanks to Neymar. THE KAZIMOR JR commented. Mbappe cannot reach the level of Neymar, Kimzich wrote. In the face of divergent opinions, DUBAWA verified the videos authenticity. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on interviews conducted for Mr Mbappe and came across a YouTube video material credited to Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) Sports in 2022. The video has apparent similarities with the TikTok post. In the video , Mr Mbappe tells CBS Sports of his decision to stay in Paris, the reactions from Spain, and the potential of winning the Champions League with PSG. We also noticed that the French players voice-speech synchronisation lacks communication cohesion, which largely indicates a digital alteration. The claim is false, and findings show that the video has been manipulated.",0
"Claim: Nigerias Daily Post newspaper , on June 13, 2021 published a news story which claimed that former president Olusegun Obasanjo has again written an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari about the current state of the nation. This news story by Fikayo Olowolagba of Daily Post is false and misleading. The referenced letter from former President Olusegun Obasanjo to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari was published in July, 2019. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo ruled Nigeria as a civilian president for two terms (May 29, 1999 to May 29, 2007). That is apart from his time as a military ruler from 1976 to 1979. Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo has come to be known to write letters to incumbent presidents who occupy office after him. He wrote an open letter to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan in 2013 . He has also written three letters to President Muhammadu Buhari since his assumption of office as a civilian president ( firs t in January 2018, second in January 2019 and a third in July, 2019). Dubawa read the contents of all three letters written by Former President Olusegu Obasanjo to incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and observed that the alleged new letter by Daily Post is exactly the same as Obasanjos 2019 letter . There is no difference whatsoever in the contents, arguments and wordings of both letters. Dubawa also called Mr. Kehinde Akinyemi, the Special Media Assistant to Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo on Sunday, June 13, 2021 and Mr. Akinyemi confirmed that his principal did not write a new letter to President Muhammadu Buhari in June, 2021. This is not the first time that individuals and news organisations would recycle old letters from Mr. Olusegun Obasanjo as recently published. On March 3, 2021, New Wave Reporters published a post claiming Obasanjo had written a new letter to President Buhari. Africa Check fact checked the story with a verdict that it was false. Facebook has also tagged the post as false information. The news story by Fikayo Olowolagba of Daily Post claiming that former President Olusegun Obasanjo has again written an open letter to President Muhammadu Buhari about the current state of the nation is false and misleading. The writer merely recycled a previous letter from July, 2019.Apart from recycling old letters, there have also been reports of creating fake letters allegedly by Mr. Obasanjo. In October 2011, the BBC claims that the Nigerian Police arrested four journalists after Mr. Obasanjo accused them of publishing a letter with a forgery of his signature.",1
"Nigerian president Bola Tinubu has begun the process of deporting 700 US citizens living in Nigeria and banned the use of US-made phones. Thats according to a screenshot of an X post doing the rounds online in Nigeria. The post says Tinubus actions are in retaliation to US president Donald Trump s tough stance against immigrants. The X post in the screenshot was published on 25 January 2025 by an account called Celebrity Blogger . While it appears that the post has been deleted, screenshots of it continue to circulate. They can be found here and here . (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) Since his inauguration on 20 January, Trump has signed several executive orders to support his mass deportation plans. An executive order is a legislative tool which allows a US president to issue legally binding orders to the federal government. A document from the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows that over 1.4 million people, including 3,690 Nigerians , face deportation from the US. ICE is an agency that imposes federal laws governing border control, customs, trade and immigration. But has Tinubu in turn begun deportation processes for US citizens and banned US-made mobile phones in Nigeria? We checked. No evidence to support the claims Africa Check found no credible news reports of Tinubu deporting US citizens or banning the use of US-made phones. Such developments would have caught the attention of the media worldwide . The account that initially made the claim on X did not provide sources. This is a major red flag. The Nigerian government told the media that by 17 February, there were 201 Nigerians in US immigration camps, with 85 already cleared for deportation. On 18 February, the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) arrested 40 illegal immigrants in Oyo state . The group included 27 Cameroonians, two Ghanaians, 10 Beninoise, and one Togolese. There has been no statement from the Nigerian government or the NIS on US citizens in the country illegally. There is also no evidence to support the claim that Tinubu has banned US-made phones.

"Claim: A message circulating on WhatsApp claims that warm water is effective in curing Asthma and 17 other health conditions. Although drinking more water may bring some health benefits, like digestion and improved kidney health, there is no scientific evidence that Japanese water therapy can cure diabetes or cancer. A viral message shared multiple times on WhatsApp claims that a group of Japanese doctors have confirmed that drinking warm water will effectively cure Asthma and17 other illnesses. While persuading readers to share the message with loved ones so that it can save lives, the message also prescribes a warm water therapy which entails drinking approximately 4 glasses of warm water on empty stomach as an effective remedy to health issues such as cancer, blood pressure, diabetes, uterus health, heart diseases, epilepsy and paralysis. The message reads partly: WARM WATER PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS, ITS VERY IMPORTANT AND CAN SAVE SOMEONES LIFE. A group of Japanese Doctors confirmed that warm water is 100% effective in resolving some health problems DO NOT eat anything 45mins after taking the water. The warm water therapy will resolve the health problems within reasonable period such as:- Diabetes in 30 days, Blood pressure in 30 days, Stomach problems in 10 days, All types of Cancer in 9 months, Blockage of veins in 6 months, Poor appetite in 10 days, Uterus and related diseases in 10 days, Nose, Ear, and Throat problems in 10 days, Women problems in 15 days, Heart diseases in 30 days, Headache/migraine in 3 days, Cholesterol in 4 months, Epilepsy and paralysis continuously in 9 months, Asthma in 4 months. COLD WATER IS BAD FOR YOU!!! If cold water does not affect you at young age, it will harm you at old age. * Cold water closes 4 veins of the heart and causes heart attack. Cold drinks are main reason for heart attack. * It also creates problems in the liver. It makes fat stuck with liver. Most people waiting for liver transplant are victims of cold water drinking. * Cold water affect internal walls of the stomach. It affects the large intestine and results in Cancer. PLEASE DONT KEEP THIS INFORMATION TO YOURSELF Tell someone to tell someone, *IT MAY SAVE SOMEONES LIFE. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER Help someone today by sharing it with your loved ones and friends, may God help us all.. Aameen The ambiguous use of a group of Japanese doctors and the continuous persuasion in the message got this researcher wondering how true the claim can be since several claims as this one have been verified to be fake and misleading. So, Dubawa decided to check the authenticity of the claim. A key word search revealed that this claim has been making the rounds since 2017 and it has been shared widely on social media and blogs. The message was shared on Pinterest , an American image sharing and social media service, and also on quora, a social question-and-answer website, and the healthy lifestyle page on facebook in 2017. Daily Times, a Nigerian based newspaper also published a report that included the claim, on 23 September 2017 attributing the source of the report to a message trending on Whatsapp. According to Healthline, drinking warm water can: Supposedly, Japanese water therapy gets its name from being widely used in Japanese medicine and among the Japanese people, according to healthline It involves drinking room-temperature or warm water on an empty stomach after waking to cleanse the digestive system and regulate gut health, which according to proponents can heal a variety of conditions. Advocates of Japanese water therapy claim that cold water is harmful to human health because it can harden the fats and oils in the digestive tract, thus slowing down digestion and causing disease. The therapy includes the following steps that should be repeated daily: According to practitioners, Japanese water therapy must be done for different periods to treat different conditions. examples: The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that men 19 and older consume 3.7 liters of water per day (15.5 cups) and women 19 and older consume 2.7 liters per day (11.5 cups). Dr Daniel Meshak, a lecturer, Department of Family Medicine, University of Jos and Consultant Family Physician, JUTH, Jos, in an interview with this researcher , said it is a false claim, noting that there is no scientific basis to explain the claim. Meshak said warm water may have health benefits, but it has not been proven scientifically. He added that water generally aids in hydration, digestion, and kidney cleansing, This Japanese water therapy has not been scientifically proven which makes it complementary and alternative medicine. Sometimes this complementary and alternative medicine as integrated with the othodox medicine if proven. But drinking a good quantity of water helps with hydration because dehydration causes headache, faecal impaction, intestinal obstruction and acute kidney injury He added. Though drinking more water may bring some health benefits like constipation and improve kidney health, there is no scientific evidence that Japanese water therapy can cure diabetes or cancer. The researcher produced this fact-check per the 2021 Kwame Karikari Fact-checking Fellowship partnership with JAY 101.9 FM Jos to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: Nigerian singer and activist Charly Boy claimed that the young model, Qian Princess, is not a human being but a robot created with Artificial Intelligence. Verdict: False! Checks across the young ladys social media handles revealed that she is a supermodel with features portraying a real human being, not a robot. Recently, Nigerian singer and activist Charles Oputa, aka Charly Boy, posted a video on his Instagram page. In the video, a young lady, who appeared to be Chinese, was seen donning a white crop top and shorts. Even though she was standing in a public place, other people kept a distance from her while taking pictures of her. In another scene, she was seen with armed guards clearing the way for her while young men eagerly captured photos and videos of her with their cameras. In his caption, Charly Boy noted that viewers might be curious about why people are taking pictures of the young lady, adding that she is not a human being but a robot. In the comment section, some users praised the innovations of the Chinese people, while others speculated that it might be one of Elon Musks creations. With the rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technology, claims like these are bound to arise frequently, which prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. An analysis of the video using INVID traced the clip to an Instagram account under the ID Qian Princess , a video creator who makes videos showing her feminine features virtually every day. The particular video reposted by Charly Boy was shared by Qian Princess on Oct 3, 2024. She had earlier posted another video in the same outfit in July 2023. DUBAWA combed the account for videos posted before this time to see if the models peculiar features were similar to those of robots. Merriam-Webster defines a robot as a machine resembling a living creature capable of moving independently and performing complex actions. TechTarget also described a robot as an automated machine that can execute specific tasks with little or no human intervention and with speed and precision. While there are various types of robots, depending on the functions of these machines, humanoid robots are one invention that robotics have either been applauded or criticised for. Common types of robots include consumer robots, aquatic robots, delivery robots, entertainment robots, industrial robots, and humanoid robots. Humanoid robots are the ones that act like humans despite the physical similarities they share with humans. Several Chinese robotics companies are ramping up efforts to create humanoid robots with lifelike features with plans to integrate them into various sectors like this company, Ex-Robots , which uses realistic silicone heads, masks, and limbs for its humanoid robots. Earlier in 2016, a team at the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei created a humanoid robot named Jia Jia. The robot can move its arms, make facial expressions, and respond to human conversation. Saudi Arabia has also recently launched its first-ever humanoid robot, Sara , which also has lifelike features, albeit with limited abilities compared to real humans. However, despite being a significant advancement over previous developments in robotics, these robots still have limitations compared to humans. To a very large extent, these humanoid robots lack the fluidity of human movements. Videos of Qian Princess show how she transits easily from one point to the other and moves her limbs easily, with human abilities largely lacking in robots. Also, close-up videos posted by the model reveal eyelids that look very human-like compared to robots. Theres no unusual flickering. The model also partakes in a couple of human activities unusual for robots shes seen on beaches, with friends and in other public spaces. Her Facebook and TikTok accounts show more human activities, with some showing her speaking clearly into the camera. Another video showed her making grocery purchases in a local store. Meanwhile, this article by Robotics Guide explained that while humanoids are popular in science fiction, they remain confined to research labs, and the dream of humanoids living among us is still a distant reality. DUBAWA subjected one of the videos to DeepWare ai , a modern tool used to detect deep fake videos. The results from the scanner showed there were no features in the video that had been manipulated. The lady shown in the video shared by Charly Boy is not a robot but a human being. While AI technology is rapidly advancing, particularly in its contribution to the field of robotics, there are still limited functions in the activities of humanoid robots.",0
"Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has put up his hotel in Morocco as a shelter for the survivors of the earthquake, according to a number of social media posts. One 10 September 2023 post reads : Despite being mocked by Morocco after loosing the worldcup, Ronaldo offered his hotel to the people affected by the earthquake in morocco. The Portuguese football team was knocked out of the 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament by Morocco in the quarterfinals. Moroccan fans trolled the Portuguese captain , saying he failed to secure a win for his team and country. A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit Morocco on 8 September 2023, killing more than 2,500 people and affecting over 2.8 million others. The Pestana CR7 hotel owned by Ronaldo in the city of Marrakech was not affected by the disaster. The claim has also been posted here , here , here , here , here , here and here , and was covered by news platforms Punch and Daily Trust . But has Ronaldos hotel hosted earthquake survivors? We checked. The hotel management has denied the claim, despite media reports about it. The management told the media that they had received many requests to host people because the hotel was not affected by the earthquake. It is not accurate to say that we are hosting refugees and victims,"" a representative of the hotel said. Sport news site Goal quotes the hotels spokesperson who labels the claim false information. A fact-check report by Reuters also debunked the claim.",0
"Claim: The commander-in-chief of the Economic Freedom Fighters of Liberia (EFFL), Emmanuel Gonquoi, said, Members of the EFFL arrested ballot boxes containing pre-marked ballot papers in Foya, Lofa County. Verdict: False! According to the police, no ballot box or pre-marked ballot papers were seized in Foya, Lofa County, and EFFL cannot provide evidence to back its claims. Late Monday afternoon on Nov. 13, 2023, various posts claiming that ballot boxes containing pre-marked ballot papers in favour of President George Weah were arrested by members of the Economic Freedom Freedom Fighters of Liberia (EFFL) went viral on the internet. Some of the posts can be seen here and here . Following the viral posts, the commander-in-chief of the EFFL, Emmanuel Gonquoi, in a press conference, took responsibility for the arrest, claiming that some unnamed sources tipped them off that a helicopter was due to transport ballot boxes containing pre-marked ballot papers in Foya and Zwedru. He claimed that the EFFL seized a few ballot boxes during the raid. Mr Gonquois comments about the seizure were made at 5:45 6:50 during the over 12-minute press conference. In the conference, Mr Gonquoi claimed that his men turned over the seized ballot boxes containing the papers to the police detachment in Lofa County, and some were given to representative Francis Nyumalin of District #1, Foya, Lofa County. Gonquoi claimed those electoral materials came on a flight, SN-B, as seen in the pictures below There were also serious alleged altercations between members of the EFFL and supporters believed to be of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), as seen in the picture below. To start with, DUBAWA contacted the head of the Economic Freedom Fighters of Liberia (EFFL), Emmanuel Gonquoi, who said that upon arresting the materials from those he claimed were members of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), he turned them over to the police in the county. When quizzed on whether he has pictorial evidence, he said, Our men who arrested the items phones were seized, and they were intimidated by the police, so we do not have any photo, but we only managed to do a video recording when the flight was leaving the scene. DUBAWA has sighted pictures and videos of the confrontation between the EFFL and the persons said to be poll watchers of the governing CDC. The pictures have been published on several social media platforms and online platforms. Some of the pictures have been posted above. However, none of the pictures indicated ballot boxes or pre-marked ballot papers. DUBAWA contacted Clement Ballah, the Police Commander in Foya district, Lofa county, but he denied seeing ballot boxes with ballot papers when his men arrived. My officers who went on the scene upon receiving the information of seized ballot boxes containing pre-marked ballot papers did not see any ballot boxes with ballot papers in them, Commander Ballah said. He added that two individuals were arrested and maltreated by men of the EFFL on account of being involved in a suspicious act. On the issue of the ballot boxes, he said: Where is the evidence yall say yall have? Up till now, there is no evidence. When we contacted Representative Nyumalin via a telephone conversation, he could not deny nor confirm the allegation but noted that he would address a news conference on Tuesday. Thomas Yollah is a journalist at Radio Tamba Taikor in Foya; he witnessed the incident. When contacted by DUBAWA, Yollah provided pictorial evidence of the helicopter and some men being manhandled by the EFFL, but no ballot box is seen in any of the pictures. Yollah said he did not see ballot boxes anywhere around the scene. To further verify the claim, this Fact-Checker also contacted some stalwarts of the ruling Congress for Democratic Change that is being accused of electoral malpractice. In response, CDC National Campaign Spokesperson Kanio Gbai Gbala called the claim patently false. Based on the accounts provided, claims that pre-marked ballot papers were discovered in Foya, Lofa County, are false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user urged the public to avoid eating noodles because it has no nutritional value and can be harmful. Verdict: MOSTLY TRUE. While noodles can potentially cause harm to the body, it still possesses some nutrients in it. Instant noodles are a type of pre-cooked noodle, usually sold in individual packets or cups and bowls. Instant noodles have been a popular food item worldwide for decades because they are affordable, convenient, and can be prepared in just a few minutes. A Facebook user named Doctor of the Future said noodles are bad for children. In his post, he advised parents to keep noodles away from children, stating that it has no nutritional value. He also stated that noodles are just synthetic wheat filled with monosodium glutamate (MSG), carcinogenic preservatives. The doctor then mentioned that noodles allegedly inflamed the gut, killed the taste buds, and destroyed the dopamine receptors. This claim has also been shared on different websites and Twitter . As of July 7, 2023, the claim had garnered 14,000 likes, 55,000 comments, and 13,000 shares since the post was made on Facebook. The virality of the claim, its popularity and the accessibility of this product made DUBAWA investigate this claim. Some research has found that regular consumption of instant noodles may be associated with poor overall diet quality. Intake of instant noodles was associated with decreased levels of vitamin D. It was also associated with obesity, a sedentary lifestyle and intake of sugar-sweetened beverages. Most instant noodles contain an ingredient known as monosodium glutamate (MSG), a common food additive used to enhance flavour in processed foods. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and t-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ) are the main preservatives added to noodles to prevent rancidness and keep them usable. BHA doubles, and TBHQ triples the shelf life of instant noodles, according to a 2006 study published in the Journal of the American Oil Chemists Society. Instant noodles are made from white flour. The nutrient-rich parts of a wheat kernel are the germ and the bran. It also contains a high amount of salt. Depending upon the manufacturing process, the amount of saturated fat found in different brands of instant noodles may differ. When fried in palm oil, lard, or butter before packaging, they will likely have a higher saturated fat content. Some instant noodles seasoning may also contain oils high in saturated fats. Check the nutrition label to learn the exact amount of saturated fats in your preferred brand of instant noodles and assess the health risk accurately. We spoke to a nutritionist, Kemi Abidakun, about the nutritional value of noodles, and she explained that while parts of the claim might be true, noodles are not entirely bad for consumption. She stated that noodles contain dietary fibre, which helps prevent constipation, iron, and copper, for people with iron deficiency and is low in calories. Remember I said part of the claim might be true because noodles are not to be consumed frequently because its ratio shows it causes more harm than good, she emphasised. We also spoke to Abiola Ayanbukola, a Doctor of surgery at Abuad teaching hospital, who told us that noodles are not good for health because they do not give the minerals and vitamins that the body needs for growth. Ms Ayanbukola said kids shouldnt eat noodles. Rather; the meal must be garnished with lots of vegetables and proteins so they can have some of the required nutrients. He said food like noodles stays in the gut and could cause harm later. She also noted that noodles have high sodium, which can affect the dopamine receptors. For children whose taste buds are just developing, the dopamine that gives the body a surge of happiness is suppressed. Noodles are affordable and easy to prepare but can cause harm to the body. Also, while noodles might not contain essential nutrients, they still have some vitamins.",1
"Singer David Adeleke, better known as Davido, has been arrested in the Nigerian capital of Abuja for attempted murder and threatening the police chief in Osun state. Thats according to a post published on a public Facebook group with over 94,600 members . Osun state is in southwest Nigeria. Breaking: Davido Arrested in Abuja Over Alleged Threat to Osun State IG, Faces Transfer to Prison for Attempted Murder, the post reads . The post links to an article that claims: Davido was taken into custody late Tuesday evening at a private residence in Abuja. Authorities claim that the arrest was based on credible intelligence suggesting that the singer had made violent threats against the Osun State IG during a heated dispute . The same claim can also be found here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Osun state politics The post uses the acronym IG, which refers to the inspector general of police , the overall head of the Nigerian police. The police chief in Osun state is the commissioner of police , Mohammed Abba. Davidos uncle Ademola Adeleke is the governor of Osun state. Davido made a series of strong-worded comments on social media about a political crisis over local governments in the state. Shortly before leaving office as Osun state governor in 2022, Adegboyega Oyetola conducted local government elections , which candidates of his party, the All Progressives Congress, won. However, a court ruling removed the local government officials before Adeleke of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) took office and set up caretaker committees to run the local councils. A court of appeal ruling on 10 February 2025 nullified the 2022 ruling that sacked the local council officials. However, the state government went ahead with the local government election on 22 February 2025. The PDP won in all 30 local government areas. In a press conference, Adeleke accused Oyetola of using the heads of security agencies in the state, including Abba, to forcefully reinstate the sacked local council officials. Adeleke claims security agents take orders from Oyetola because he is president Bola Tinubus nephew . Davido criticised and insulted Abba on the social media platform X. In one tweet, Davido wrote : Mr Umar abba osun state commissioner u are a disgrace to ur children !! !!! Game on FUCKER !!!! All of us go mad together !! Werey. In another post, Davido said : Mr commissioner respect the rule of law!!! You are not madder or crazier than us !! Make we all kuku mad !! MEN MOUNT WALAI TO KRF!!! I will post u everyday everywhere Mr man !!! Try me fucker . Was Davido arrested for tweeting these and more? We checked. No evidence of the claim Davido, a Grammy nominated singer, has 16.4 million followers on X and 29.4 million on Instagram . If he was indeed arrested for threatening a police chief or attempted murder, it wouldve made headlines. We found multiple news reports on Davidos comments on the Osun political crisis but no mention of him getting arrested. Such selective media coverage is unlikely. Davido apologised and praised Abba Later, in a series of tweets titled My Take on Osun CP, NPF and Forthcoming LG Elections , Davido noted that he initially failed to recognise the efforts of Abba and other security agents to keep Osun state peaceful amid the crisis.

"In January 2020 , a Lagos based lawyer, Malcome Omirhobo, filed a suit before the Federal High Court against the Federal Government, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and others over Arabic inscription on Naira notes. The lawyer asked the court to absolve the CBN of the mandate to print and circulate Naira notes bearing Arabic inscriptions as a legal tender for a secular state that has English as its official language. Omirhobo is of the view that the presence of the Arabic inscriptions on the Naira notes contravened the provisions of section 10 and 55 of the Nigerian constitution and is in a bid to Islamize the Nigerian state. It is against this backdrop that a Nigeria-based Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), a group which claims to position itself as a human rights organization promoting, protecting, and projecting the rights of Muslims, made a couple of claims regarding the claims about the Bible and Arabic inscription on Naira currency. MURICs claims, projecting facts, mostly counters arguments of the lawyers and other people against the said Arabic inscription on Nigerias Naira. Mostly true Verification : According to Encyclopedia Britannica Al-Khwrizm, whose full name was Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm, (born c. 780 died c. 850), is a Muslim mathematician and astronomer whose major works introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into European mathematics. It also states that the hindu-Arabic numerals consisting of a set of 10 symbols 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 originated in India in the 6th or 7th century and were introduced to Europe through the writings of Middle Eastern mathematicians, especially al-Khwarizmi and al-Kindi, about the 12th century. Also, G J Toomer, in the Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970-1990) stated that it is likely enough that the decimal place-value system was a fairly recent arrival from India and that al-Khwrizms work was the first to expound it systematically. A quote attributed to Mohammad Kahn cited in the book The Muslim contribution to mathematics by A A alDaffa (London, 1978) states inter alia In the foremost rank of mathematicians of all time stands Al-Khwarizmi. He composed the oldest works on arithmetic and algebra..The work on arithmetic first introduced the Hindu numbers to Europe. A report from the 14th Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) Conference held in Uzbekistan in October 2020 also attributed the introduction of Arabic numerals to the West to Al-Khwarizmi. Conclusion: All the publications that attributed the Arabic numerals to Al-Khwarizmi stated that he introduced the numerals to the West and the European countries. None of them established the fact that it was invented by him. Interestingly enough, God is called Allah in the Arabic Bible, as quoted in the statement. True Verification : Encyclopedia Britannica states that Allah is the standard Arabic word for God and is used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews as well as by Muslims. According to the Encyclopedia it is believed that God described himself in the Arabic language as Allh. A website christiananswers.net in a post answering to why Arab Christians referred to God as Allah stated And what about the 10 to 12 million Arab Christians today? They have been calling God Allah in their Bibles, hymns, poems, writings, and worship for over nineteen centuries Also an Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry on its website clarified that the first-known translation of the Bible into Arabic, which took place in the 9th century, uses the word Allah for God and that Arab Christians were using the word Allah for God prior to the dawn of Islam. Similarly a post on Medium by Fatima Karim explaining the similarities between the Muslim and Christian Allah posited that If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word Allah being used where God is used in English. This is because Allah is a word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word God with a capital G. Fatima used the visualisation below to support her assertion. Dubawa went ahead to download an Arabic Bible with English translation to verify further. In verse 11 of Mark Chapter 3, we see that You are the son of God! written in the English version is in quotes with an exclamation. Dubawa traced the exact quote with an exclamation to the Arabic version and saw that the Arabic writing for God is similar to what is seen in the visualisation made by FatimaKarim. Also in an audio Bible on YouTube , the reader is heard mentioning the word Allah while reading out loud the book of John. Conclusion: Several search results supported the claim that the Arabic Bible refers to God as Allah It was not even Nigerian Muslim leaders who brought the idea of Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria. The man who initiated it was a Christian, an Urhobo officer, by name General David Akpode Ejoor (rtd). He was the one who introduced the Arabic inscription and the Star emblem into the Nigeria Army crest, as quoted in the statement. Partially True Verification : A blog post on Urhobo Voice attributed the designing of the Army cap badge to David Ejoor while rendering him a tribute after his death in 2019 it read The officer who designed the Army Cap Badge and Rank insignias in 1962. Also, David Ejoor in page 16 of his book Reminiscences stated that the idea behind the Arabic inscription and star emblem introduced into the Nigerian cap badge was for Defence and Unity, which are part of what the Nigerian Army stands for to defend the unity and integrity of Nigeria. In page 16 of the book, Ejoor wrote, In seeking a new design, I was anxious that the symbol should reflect the duty of the army and should be capable of inspiring officers and men. As I searched, I remembered the battle between the British and the Sokoto forces in 1903. At that battle, the Sokoto forces had carried the Sultans flag with an Arabic inscription on it. That Arabic inscription I learnt meant, VICTORY IS FROM GOD ALONE. However, submission by the CBN in response to the suit by the Lagos-based lawyer did not support the claim that David Ejoor initiated the Arabic inscription on the Naira. CBN noted that the inscriptions on the naira notes dates back to the colonial era. The CBN explained that the naira notes retained the inscriptions with Ajami since 1973 when the name of the Nigerian currency was changed to naira from pounds. The Ajami was inscribed on the countrys currency by the colonialists to aid those without Western education in certain parts of the country, who, back then, constituted a larger part of the populace. Also, a New Yorker report reiterates this assertion. In the report by Caelainn Hogan, the reporter interviews an archivist who says the Arabic script, had been printed on nearly every note since the naira was introduced, in 1973, and on previous currency as well. The archivist was able to show this reporter a piece minted in 1945 as evidence that the British pounds used in Nigeria during the colonial era prior to the advent of the Naira had Arabic inscriptions on them. To further verify this claim, Dubawa reached out to a PhD student of African History at the Michigan State University, Ozibo Ozibo. He could not confirm that it was General David Akpode Ejoor (Rtd) that brought the idea of the Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria but he, however, provided pictorial evidence that showed the Arabic inscription was on the British Pound used in Nigeria during the colonial era. Conclusion : Apart from his book where he tried to document history, no other strong indications point to that fact that it was Ejoor who introduced the Arabic writing into the Army cap badge. However, while there was some evidence to show that David Ejoor introduced the Arabic inscription on the Nigeria cap badge, several searches did not return results that show he was the one that introduced it into the Nigerian currency. Many of those saddled with the task of uniting us have become instruments of division. Ex-President Jonathan is an example. He removed Arabic from the naira because he listened to hate preachers whom he took along on his futile but numerous trips to Jerusalem, as quoted in the statement. Misleading Verification : An observation of the Nigerian Naira notes show that the Arabic inscriptions are only absent in the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Naira denominations of the Naira while the 200, 500 and 1000 Naira notes still have the Arabic inscriptions. Also, reports show that it was only the Arabic inscription on the 100 Naira note that was removed under Goodluck Jonathan s administration when the note was redesigned by the CBN to commemorate 100 years of Nigerias amalgamation. However, the Arabic inscriptions in the 5, 10, 20, 50 Naira notes were removed during the regime of President Olusegun Obasanjo and not under President Goodluck Jonathan. Meanwhile, the Naira is regarded as Nigerias monetary unit; it is the official currency for the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is divided into 100 Kobos. It was introduced in 1973 to replace the British pound which was in use during the colonial era. The CBN has the sole authority to issue banknotes and coins. Coin denominations range from 50 kobo to 2 naira while Banknotes are denominated in values from five to 1000 Naira. If the Naira is an official legal tender that encompasses all denominations of the Nigerian currency, it cannot be said that Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic inscriptions from the Naira because the 100 Naira banknote is not the only Nigerian Naira. Conclusion : It cannot be said that ex-president Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic from the Naira when there are still Nigerian currencies bearing the Arabic inscription. This claim is therefore misleading.

"CLAIM : A Twitter user @drpenking tweeted an image that showed the Labour Party got 29,568 votes in Agege and claimed INEC switched the results to APC and reduced the numbers for Labour Party to 13,270. FINDING: Updates from various news outlets shows that APC won the Labour Party by a landslide in Agege local government area. We collated the results for each party and found that APC actually had 29,568 votes while Labour Party had a lesser total number of votes. VERDICT: INCORRECT.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message encourages parents to deworm their children, implying that not doing so could lead to sudden death. This message is misleading. While deworming children is essential, not doing so cannot (alone, without other factors) cause sudden death as depicted in the message. Deworming, according to Gi Doc is the process of expelling intestinal worms or parasitic worms from the body by administering an anthelmintic medicine/drug. Anthelmintic medicines/drugs are simply medications used to eliminate worms from the body. Deworming is also known as worming, drenching or dehelmintization. Worms are known as helminth parasites; they are of various types (like roundworms, tapeworms or flukes) and they affect humans (children/adults) as well as animals. Medical experts, therefore, encourage regular deworming to eliminate worms. Worms can be transmitted into the body by playing in the sand, through contact with worm infested poop, eating raw or infected food, not washing hands before eating, walking barefooted and not maintaining good hygiene. Worm infestation can affect individuals health and lead to serious complications, but can worm infestation cause sudden death? A WhatsApp message tells the story of how a Nigerian baby died at a general hospital due to worm infestation. The message then encourages residents of Oyo State in South West Nigeria to partake in the state governments deworming exercise. The second to the last paragraph in the message claims that Oyo State was having a deworming exercise on that day (the day the copied message was posted) which was July 13, 2021. Dubawa searched online. Although there was information about deworming exercises in Oyo State, they were for previous years. This implies that the WhatsApp message might have been a recycled message from previous years. To ascertain the authenticity of the medical claims in the message, Dubawa reached out to two Consultant Public Health physicians. Dr. Doyin Ogunyemi, Consultant Public Health Physician and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Community Health and Primary Care, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), told Dubawa that the claims are exaggerated. Deworming, Dr. Ogunyemi said, is important as it helps eliminate worms that, if left unchecked, could cause stomach pains, fatigue, weakness, bloody stool, itching anus and signs of stunting and malnutrition. In severe cases, it may lead to intestinal obstruction requiring surgery but worms on their own cannot lead to sudden death. She said what is likely to occur is death occurring from complications of severe anaemia and intestinal obstruction, and these occur over a period of time and are very unlikely to cause death as depicted in the message. Dr. Nasir Ariyibi, a Consultant Public Health Physician and the Medical Director of Lagos State University Health Centre, affirmed Dr. Ogunyemis position, noting that WhatsApp stories are usually designed to cause panic while claiming to offer advice. Dr. Ariyibi noted that the story does not add up and while doctors may note likely cause of death, they are unlikely to do so in the unprofessional manner depicted in the story. Dr. Ariyibi noted that worm infestation can also cause schistosomiasis, blood in urine and some other forms of skin infections. Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by freshwater parasitic worms that can enter the body and travel to different parts like the kidney and liver and cause great discomfort. Dr. Ariyibi is also of the opinion that worm infestation (if not treated over a long time) can lead to serious complications, and it is those serious complications (if untreated) that can lead to death, so it is not a linear process of worm infestation simply causing sudden death. However, Dr. Ariyibi encouraged Nigerians to deworm themselves and children about twice a year or at least once a year and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene to prevent worm infestation, its complications and other diseases. Regular deworming is encouraged as well as good hygiene, and worm infestation, if not treated early enough, could lead to serious complications. However, worm infection cannot simply lead to death as depicted in the WhatsApp story.",0
"The presidential town hall series organised by Daria Media Limited is on its third day. Rabiu Kwankwaso, Presidential candidate of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), and his running mate, Bishop Isaac Idahosa, are expected to appear on todays show. The series, tagged The Candidates, provides a platform for Nigerians to engage candidates on issues related to nation-building. The town hall series, which started on Thursday, November 17 is planned to host six presidential and vice presidential candidates. Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore and his running mate Haruna Magashi were on the show on Friday. At the same time, their counterpart in the Social Democratic Party, Adewole Adebayo and Yusuf Buhari, were interviewed on Thursday. The series, anchored by Nigerian journalist, Kadaria Ahmed, is supported by the MacArthur Foundation, Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), and YouTube. As a member of the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition (NCF), DUBAWA will be involved in live fact-checking of claims made by the candidates. Claims made by the candidates and fact-check reports are presented below: Claim: NNPP Presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, claimed his government sponsored over 3,000 Kano residents to study in Nigeria and abroad In four years. Sen. Kwankwaso had made a similar claim in a Daily Trust and ThisDay newspapers in the past. He said that he sold his properties to sponsor 3,000 Kano residents in local and international institutions. However, there is no official record or source to verify this information independently. Verdict: Insufficient evidence Source: Daily Trust, ThisDay Date: 19/11/2022 Claim: NNPP Presidential candidate, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, claimed that he never borrowed money when he was governor of Kano state. Multiple media reports confirmed that Kwankwaso borrowed N4.1 billion from pensioners funds to build Bandirawo and Amana Housing Estates. In a Vanguard report in 2021, the former Kano governor was probed by the EFCC for allegedly mismanaging N10bn pension remittances between 2011 and 2015. Verdict: Incorrect Source: Premium Times, Vanguard Newspaper Date: 19/11/2022 Claim:NNPP presidential candidate, Rabiu Kwankwaso, claimed that he didnt leave debt behind in his two terms in office as the governor of Kano state. Kwankwaso was the governor of Kano State between 1999-2003 and 2011-2015. According to data from the Debt Management Office, Kano state had a debt of 59.8 bn US dollars( $59,796,931.03) as of June 30, 2015, about a month after Kwankwaso left the office. Similarly, a report by Premium Times quoted the Kano states treasury department as saying Kwankwaso left over N200 billion in debt as a governor in 2015. No data was found yet on Kanos debt profile when he left office in 2003. Verdict: Incorrect Source: DMO Date: 19/11/2022",1
"Claim: Sahara Reporters on Facebook alleged that ex-NDDC board chairperson Lauretta Onochie was embarrassed and kicked out of her UK home. Verdict: There is no sufficient evidence to support the claim. In contrast, Ms Onochie explained the occurrence of the day on X (Twitter). Lauretta Onochie is the former media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari and Chairman of the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). She was also appointed as the personal assistant to the president on social media in 2016. Mr Buhari nominated the Onochie-led board in November 2022 amid controversy over the role played by the former special assistant on social media to the president. Less than a year after she was appointed , President Bola Tinubu disbanded the board and management of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) led by Ms Onochie. In its place, he appointed new board members headed by Chiedu Ebie from Delta State. Following this development, Sahara Reporters on Facebook alleged that Ms Onochie was embarrassed and kicked out by family members in the United Kingdom (UK). The post was shared with a video showing Ms Onochie sitting with different travelling bags. As of Sept. 3, 2023, the post has garnered 781 likes, 547 comments, and 91 shares. DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim because of its sensitive nature and the personalities involved. We looked into Ms Onochies social media profiles and discovered that she narrated the full accounts of the events on the said day on her X (formerly known as Twitter) profile. In her post, she explained that her cousin, whom she housed, tried to take her home, but after a battle, she recovered it. My Cousin, Victor Fejokwu and his wife, Ruth Emereze, were stranded, in fact, homeless at the time. I took pity on them, took them in, to house them in my home. A year ago, when I started making plans to return to continue housing them, they blocked my phone number. I had no access to my letters. Consequently, I missed quite a number of appointments, part of the post read. They stopped contributing to the rent when they both had jobs, preferring to host lavish parties. I called the police, who dealt them a heavy blow, telling them they must vacate for me unless I was willing to continue to house them. The cowardly thug ran away before the arrival of the Police. The other young lady went to my bed and spread herself out. Of course, I got her out, she narrated. Ms Onochie stated that the couple began to plead, asking to be allowed to stay, but she refused, and they moved out two days later. We conducted an advanced keyword search to find news reports on this event but found none except the report by Sahara reporters. However, major news outlets like Daily Post , Guardian , and Punch have also reported her recovering at home. We also searched reverse images to see if the video was new, recirculated, or used out of context but found none. There is no sufficient evidence to support the Sahara Reporters allegation. Meanwhile, Ms Onochie explained the occurrence on X and said she had recovered her home.",1
"Claim: Two prominent digital media platforms recently reported that a federal lawmaker, Shina Peller, said Bola Tinubu should not be anointed as Nigerias next president in 2023. Misleading and sensationalised, the media platforms clearly quoted Shina Peller out of context. There is no place the lawmaker mentioned that Tinubu should not be anointed the next president, hence the claim is false. Notable digital media platforms, including Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazzette , recently reported that a member of the federal House of Representatives, Shina Peller, said Bola Tinubu should not be anointed as Nigerias next president. The media platforms also reported that the federal lawmaker representing Iseyin, Itesiwaju, Kajola and Iwajowa said political figures like the former Lagos State governor should not be allowed to take over the countrys helms of affairs in 2023. Coincidentally, the claim was attributed to Peller barely 24 hours after Tinubu, the national leader of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), made a sensational return to the country. The former Lagos governor had been out of Nigeria on medical tourism in London. He returned on Friday night, October 8, and was given a rousing welcome by the incumbent Lagos State governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. With the coincidence in Tinubus return and Pellers alleged statement, the report drew massive reactions from Nigerians on social media. Using the Crowdtangle web extension, a check on Sahara Reporters Twitter page of nearly four million followers showed that the story has 1,400 reactions (1,063 likes and 336 retweets.) A further search via Crowdtangle showed that many social media users shared the post on Facebook for their followers as contained here and here . Bola Tinubu, APC national leader and one of the founding fathers of the ruling party, has been rumoured to be eyeing the giant stool of power in the country in 2023 after the tenure of the current president Muhammadu Buhari. Although there is not yet an official declaration from his camp, the former governor, who enjoys an incredibly massive cult-hero respect from his teeming legion of followers and loyalists, has not publicly distanced himself from the campaigns linked to him. And in what has set the wheel of campaign on the move, his loyalists have begun his presidential campaign with his posters recently flooding London streets. On Tuesday, December 15, 2020, some of his followers led by former senator and minister Dayo Adeyeye, met in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, to launch a presidential campaign movement tagged The South-West Agenda (SWAGA). SWAGA is a movement backing the Tinubu 2023 agenda. A self-styled socialite and king of African nightclubs, Taoreed Shina Abiola Peller is an entrepreneur, politician, industrialist born into the family of late Moshood Abiola Peller, a renowned late magician. The 45-year-old, who traces his origins to Iseyin, a local government in Oyo State, rose to prominence in Lagos with his revolution of nightclubs in Africathanks to his Quilox club. In 2019, Peller contested on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the Iseyin, Itesiwaju, Kajola, Iwajowa seat in the House of Representatives. A peoples favourite , he defeated the then incumbent Olasupo Abiodun with 44,088 votes in a keenly contested election that officially introduced him to politics and government. Peller who describes himself as an exceptional philanthropist who is selfless in many ways is an advocate for youth participation in politics. He was recently given the chieftaincy title of Ayedero of Yorubaland by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamide Adeyemi. Verifying the claim, Dubawa found that truly Shina Peller spoke in a video interview with Sam Olatunji on his programme tagged Uncut with BigSam, where he spoke on the 2023 presidential election. However, there is no place he mentioned Tinubu or stated directly that the APC national leader should not be anointed Nigerias next president as claimed by Gazzette and Sahara Reporters. When asked about Bola Tinubus chance and Buharis successorship, Peller responded that leaders should be selected based on competence and upon fulfilling criteria. The lawmaker emphasised that an institution should be built to see who meets up with the criteria for occupying power instead of taking a single person and rallying around that person. Swinging back the pendulum on Nigerias political history, the lawmaker stated that Nigeria has made two mistakes by presenting President Muhammadu Buhari and one of his predecessors Olusegun Obasanjo in a messianic robe to the people. He said: We have made the mistake two times. There was a time in Nigeria when President Obasanjo was brought from prison and everybody was saying he is the best person that could do this and we started to run around him. The same thing happened to President Buhari, everybody was saying Mohammadu Buhari is a saint, he is not corrupt and then everyone starts to run around him, I believe this must stop. We need to build an institution now, we do not need to take any single person and be saying we want to now rally around that person. I think let us form an institution, let us identify criteria and let us see who meets up with the criteria. There is no institution that has set up the criteria yet, if the criteria say the next president should be Christian, is Asiwaju a Christian? Dubawas findings revealed that the lawmaker also issued a rebuttal to the reports in the Gazette and SR, describing it as a misrepresentation. A check on his Facebook and Instagram page showed that on Sunday, October 10, the lawmaker stated that contrary to what was reported, he only commented on the age-long political style of forcing candidates down the throat of the citizens, without thinking of the principles of equity, equality and fairness. Here is the full statement: My attention has been drawn to the news on blogs quoting me to have said that the APC Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu should not be anointed as next President. Sadly, it is a misrepresentation of what I said. To set the record straight, I have nothing against our leader nor his presidential ambition. I have enjoyed a father and son relationship with him for years, and it remains so. I commented on the age-long political style of forcing candidates down the throat of the citizens, without thinking of the principles of equity, equality and fairness. I stated that the rest of the world is leaving Nigeria behind in terms of rapid growth and development and only through strong institutions, we can collectively make just decisions for visible progress in the country, especially in our electioneering process. The next general election is a reset period for our dear country. We must get it right! Our collective decision must be based on promoting peace and unity. Also, I urge the media practitioners, who are regarded as the fourth estate of the realm, to use their powerful instruments to promote love, peace and unity rather than stir up disunity, disaffection and unnecessary conflicts. When contacted, one of the media aides to the Iseyin-born lawmaker, Hammed Olabisi, said his principal did not attack Tinubu as mischievously reported in the news. What he said was that we should rely on God Almighty to choose the best for us and that we should not anoint as we have always done in the past. Citing examples of Yaradua and current president Muhammad Buhari. He added that we should allow due process to take its cause instead of making the entire things to look like we have no procedures guiding us in selecting our leaders. Olabisi also emphasised that what Peller said was that building a strong institution will go a long way in picking a better candidate. Examining the news report showed that Sahara Reporters and Peoples Gazzettes headlines were misleading and mischievously sensationalised. Shina Peller was misrepresented and quoted out of context.

"Claim: A Facebook post by Goal Africa suggested that the Confederation of African Football (CAF) awarded three points to Libya after the Super Eagles of Nigeria boycotted the second leg of their match against the North African side for alleged maltreatment. Verdict : Misleading! Contrary to the claim, CAF has yet to announce its verdict. On Tuesday, Goal Africa, a sports-focused platform with 3.7 million followers on Facebook, posted that CAF had awarded three points to Libyas football team after the Super Eagles of Nigeria withdrew from an Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) game against them. The post came amid the face-off between Nigeria and Libya, which are both jostling for a spot at the 2025 AFCON, which is scheduled to be held in Morocco . On October 11, Libyas football team, known as the Mediterranean Knights, played against the Super Eagles of Nigeria at Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. Nigeria won the encounter 1-0, courtesy of a late goal by Fisayo Dele-Bashiru. The return leg of the encounter was originally billed to be held on October 15 at the Martyrs Stadium in Benina, Benghazi, Libya. On October 13, the Nigerian team departed the Aminu Kano International Airport for Benghazi. Trouble, however, started when the flight was diverted to Al-Abraq International Airport. At Al-Abraq International Airport, the Nigerian team and other accompanying officials were allegedly held for hours without being attended to. Rankled by the development, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) announced that the Nigerian team would boycott the game. The Super Eagles eventually returned to Nigeria on Monday, October 15, amid the outrage trailing the development. The NFF later detailed the teams ordeal in a lengthy article published via its website . There were unsubstantiated claims that Libyas treatment of the Super Eagles was in retaliation for a similar experience they allegedly faced during their visit to Nigeria. But reacting, the Libyan Football Federation (LFF) denied the sabotage allegation . The LFF said the diversion of the Nigerian delegations chartered ValueJet aircraft to Al Abraq International Airport instead of Benghazi as planned was due to air traffic control protocols and security checks that are standard in international travel. It further attributed the Super Eagles hours-long delay at the airport to logistical challenges. Amid this development, Goal Africa posted a message suggesting that CAF had automatically awarded three points to the Libyan national team. The Super Eagles are back in Nigeria! Libyans are happy 3 points secured. Awaiting the final verdict from CAF, the post reads . As of the time of filing this report, the post had garnered 8,900 likes, 1,200 comments and 41 shares. Although the post included awaiting the final verdict from CAF, many ran with the 3 points secured part, which actually suggested it had already been confirmed. Checks in the comment section of the post showed many users believed it to be true. A user, George Marciano, commented : It serves them (Nigeria) right. Nigeria needs to learn the hard way. You cannot mistreat your visitors knowing that youre going to visit them in the next few days. Libya is the great country that fears no other country (sic). You cannot serve em shit expect to be served a pizza when its your turn (sic). Another user, Hargreaves Arafat Okumu, wrote : Thats a good news, Nigerians wont treat any national or foreign club team badly again (sic). In the same vein, Shariffkey Sharifkey wrote : Congratulations Libya. Further checks, however, showed a few other users doubted the post. For instance, a user, Bobbie Oladele Switness queried : GOAL Africa, are you now the person assigning points to countries? Another user, Prince Orebote Oyebanji Emmanuel, wrote in Pidgin English : Na you dash them 3 points? Considering the sensitivity of the issue, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. Using keywords on Google search, DUBAWA found no report that CAF awarded three points to Libya, as suggested by the post. Further findings showed CAF released a statement on the issue on Monday, promising to probe it through its disciplinary board. The statement reads: The Confederation Africaine de Football (CAF) has been in contact with the Libyan and Nigerian authorities after it had been informed that the Nigerian National Football Team (Super Eagles) and their technical team were stranded in disturbing conditions for several hours at an airport that they were allegedly instructed to land by the Libyan authorities. The matter has been referred to the CAF Disciplinary Board for investigation, and appropriate action will be taken against those who violated the CAF Statutes and Regulations. In a follow-up statement on Tuesday, the African football governing body announced that the match between the two countries would not take place as scheduled. The TotalEnergies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2025 Qualifier fixture between Libya and Nigeria will not take place as scheduled tonight. The matter will be referred to the competent CAF bodies, CAF declared. The above indicates that the matter is still ongoing, and no decision has been reached yet. The claim that Libya has secured three points after the Super Eagles of Nigeria boycotted the CAF African Nations Cup Qualifiers against the country is misleading. The African football governing body is still investigating the matter.",1
"Claim: A news report by Weetalknaija claims Garba Shehu said the killings in Benue will continue until Ortom cooperates with Buhari. The headline of the news report is false and misleading. Our findings show this was just a sensational headline as the content of the story and the press release by Garba Shehu contradicts the headline. Benue State has been on the map for the killings of its citizens/residents, from the killing of one officer and 10 soldiers who were on stabilisation operation in the state to the killing of seven Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in a camp in Abagena, a Makurdi suburb on Monday, April 25, 2021 . Reacting to these killings, governor Samuel Ortom said the unfortunate development could have been averted if the federal government was proactive, noting that over 70 persons were killed within two weeks in Makurdi, Gwer West and Guma Local Government Area (LGAs). It is an unfortunate development what is happening, if the federal government had taken a proactive step, we will not be where we are. In the last two weeks, over 70 persons just in Makurdi local government area alone. It is not acceptable. Excerpt of Ortoms comment. He explained that he had alerted the nation when Fulanis from 14 countries met in Yola and declared that except Benue reviews the prohibition of open grazing law, it will not know peace. He added that he had written to the federal government to arrest the leaders of Miyetti Allah that hosted that meeting, but nothing was done. On the heels of this development, a report by Weetalknaija on Friday, April 30, 2021, claims President Muhammadu Buharis Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the killing will continue if Ortom does not cooperate with Buhari. Dubawa studied the report by Weetalknaija and also conducted a keyword search which led to other reports by different news platforms. Going through this report, which quoted Buharis spokesperson, Garba Shehu, as making this claim in its headline, Dubawa observed that this claim was not contained in the body of the news report. The body of the report noted Mr Shehu called on the Ortom government to cooperate with the Federal Government in implementing national strategies to end this issue. Benue under the Ortoim administration ought to cooperate with the Federal Government in the implementation of a number of national strategies programs in addressing underlying issues militating against peace, progress and development. Excerpt of Weetalknaijas report. Dubawa also compared this report by Weetalknaija with other news platforms. A report by Premium Times based on the same statement by Garba Shehu gave a different narrative. This report noted that the president was disappointed with governor Ortoms comment in reaction to these killings. Screenshot of Premium Times report. Another report by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) shares the same narrative of the presidents disappointment with the Premium Times report. Dubawa also obtained the press release these stories were based on and noted there was nowhere in the statement that reflected weetalknaijas headline. The press release only called for the cooperation of the Ortom-led government. The news report that claims Garba Shehu said the killings in Benue State will continue unless Ortom cooperates with Buhari is false and misleading. Our findings show this was just a sensational headline as the content of the story and the press release contradicts the headline.",0
"The stage is set for the Osun State governorship election holding today, Saturday 16th June. 1,479,595 registered voters are eligible to participate in the election across the 30 local government areas in the state.According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), these are the number of persons out of the 1,955,657 registered voters who have collected their Permanent Voters Card (PVCs). A total of 21, 000 police personnel , 79 local and eight foreign observers , have been deployed for the election with a promise of a transparent election by the electoral commission. 15 candidates are contesting to run the affairs of the state for another four years. DUBAWA, in partnership with journalists and observers on the ground, will be running quick checks to debunk claims on the election. Claim: The official PDP handle on Twitter (@officialPDPNig) claims that the Nigerian Army arrested Asiri Eniba, Chairman of NURTW in Osun State with assorted rifles and other dangerous weapons on Friday, July 15. Although the army has yet to confirm the occurrence or respond to calls placed by DUBAWA, reports by PunchNG and other reliable media platforms stated that some soldiers arrested Asiri Eniba with some weapons in Osogbo on Friday. Claim: A Twitter user (@Gyalep), in efforts to convince voters to vote for Governor Oyetola, claims the governor has approved the release of over N477 million as premium for citizens under the Osun Health Insurance Scheme, OHIS. It is no big secret. Governor Oyetola has been widely reported by various media outlets to have released N477.9 million as a premium for the enrolment of vulnerable citizens into the Osun Health Insurance Scheme (OHIS). Details of the report were published on this PunchNg report. Claim: A Twitter user, Giyale Miemene Paul (@Gyalep) highlighting reasons why people should vote for the incumbent governor, Oyetola, claims that he (Governor Oyetola) has refurbished and revitalised 332 PHCs in Osun. An exclusive report by Humangle reveals that the PHCs are not in a good condition contrary to what the state reported . In a phone interview with Humanangles Adejumo Kabir, he reinstated the stance of their report and further revealed that the equipment meant to be procured were not. The Osun state government reacted to the findings confirming it as valid. Claim: A WhatsApp message has a claim that the candidate of the Labour party, Lasun Yusuf, has stepped down for PDP candidate, Ademola Adeleke, in the ongoing Osun election. The Labour Party Candidate, Lasun Yusuf, said in a live interview on Channels Television that he has voted and is still in the race. Also, the national Chairman of the Labour party, Julius Abure, told DUBAWA the information is false. He added that Mr Yusuf is still in the race. Claim: A Twitter user, (@iam_doctormayor) shared a video claiming that the police has intercepted thugs with locally made guns and charms at Ogbonarugbo Ward 8, Unit 7, Ilesa. Phillip Anjorin, a CJID observer who was at the location, confirmed that the police were at the location and indeed arrested some thugs who were in possession of charms and arms. DUBAWA further analyzed the video, and the timestamp of the footage revealed it was captured and shared around 11: 30 a.m. today. Claim: A Twitter user, FUTA BRO (@FutsBro), shared a video wherein it was announced that the Osun governorship election had been declared inconclusive. Our findings show that the video was from the 2018 Osun governorship election, which was declared inconclusive. Claim: A Twitter user, QUEEN SADY (@HajiyaSadiya2), claims the PDP has won the Osun governorship election. Updates from our observers show vote collation is still ongoing at different Local Government Areas and no winner has been declared. Claim : A Twitter user Olumide_diamond (@OluwatobaAkind1), shared a Tik Tok video with the screenshot of a breaking news insinuating governor Oyetola said he was ready to leave. A close look at the video, which has Tope Alabis music playing in the background, showed the screenshot was doctored. One, the screenshot does not contain the image or name of any media organisation, two, it does not show a timestamp which live reports usually carry and three, this has not been reported by any news platform.",1
"A post on Facebook claims to have the solution for haemorrhoids. It says that a mixture of bitter kola , onions and scent leaf can effectively treat them. The post also explains how to prepare and mix the ingredients and how often to take the mixture. Haemorrhoids , also known as piles, are swollen blood vessels located in or around the rectum and anus. Symptoms include bright red blood after a bowel movement, lumps around the anus and the feeling of needing to poo. Bitter kola is a tree found in the subtropical and tropical forests of Nigeria, Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African countries. Scent leaf , or African basil, has antiviral properties and may also help to boost the immune system. The same post has been republished here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) Could this be the cure for haemorrhoids? We checked. No scientific evidence, says gastroenterologist Samuel Olorunfemi said there was no medical evidence to support the claim. He is a professor of gastroenterology at Bingham University Nasarawa in north-central Nigeria, No research has been conducted on this claim. I am not aware of the recommended combination and so, there is no scientific evidence for it, he told Africa Check. Haemorrhoids can be treated with fibre-rich foods, creams, warm baths and painkillers. In more serious cases, haemorrhoids may require minimally invasive treatment or surgery. Africa Check has previously debunked other false claims about haemorrhoid remedies. This one, too, is misleading.

"CLAIM: INEC relocates ICT staffers from Abuja ahead of a rerun election. VERDICT: FALSE. There is no information related to the claim on INECs website. The commission last undertook a redeployment exercise back in August 2023. A Facebook user, John Nwaokorie, posted that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is redeploying some of its staffers who work in the organisations Information Communication Technology (ICT) arm ahead of a possible rerun election. There may be a rerun for the presidential elections because they are transferring some directing staffs in ICT in Abuja, and those staffs are mostly from a particular region, where they perceive LP has more supporters, part of the Facebook post reads. The claimant further asserted that due to the redeployment, supposedly limited to an unnamed region, the staff left in the ICT are from the North and southwest. Before the final judgement of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT), which came to a wrap yesterday, September 6, 2023, there were rumours of a presidential rerun election. However, an election rerun was only dependent on the tribunals outcome. The post, which received a fairly low engagement, garnered only 21 likes and 12 comments as of Wednesday, September 6, 2023however, some commentators were sceptical about it. Can I get your graphic designer? He really did a great job manipulating this, Micheal Olajide scorned . We have eyes on them all(.) declared Martin Luther Agweye. Due to the gravity of the claim, we decided to fact-check it. We viewed INECs website and found nothing related to the development on their news dashboard. We discovered that the last time the electoral commission redeployed some of its top hierarchy staffers, including Resident Election Commissioners (REC) and directors, was in August 2022. News outlets such as Punch , This Day , Daily Post , and The Sun all reported the development. Significantly, all the staffers that were redeployed were not Information Communication Technology (ICT) personnel, but there were those from other departments of the commission. The redeployment happened among those working both in the north and south-east axis of the country, contrary to the impression the claim tried to create. Meanwhile, INEC plans to only conduct gubernatorial and State House of Assembly elections in Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi, according to its website . No announcement has been made to conduct an election rerun. We also called INECs National Commissioner and Chairman of the Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, for further comment, but he has yet to respond. The claim is false.There is no information relating to the claim on INECs website. INEC also last undertook a redeployment operation back in August 2022, according to news outlets.",0
"Claim : X user said Nigerians pay the lowest tax in the world. Verdict : False. While Nigeria has one of the lowest tax rates globally, this does not necessarily mean its citizens pay the least taxes. Bill Gates, popular philanthropist and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, recently visited Nigeria to speak at Nutrivision 2024, a Pan-African youth dialogue on nutrition. Mr Gates said that tax collection in Nigeria is pretty low, adding that this presents a significant challenge in adequately financing critical sectors Over time, there are plans for Nigeria to fund the government more than it does today. The actual tax collection in Nigeria is actually pretty low, Gates said. His remark has continued to elicit mixed reactions among Nigerians. While some advised Mr Gates to remain silent on the issue of low tax collection, citing the alleged embezzlement of public funds by government officials in Nigeria, others agreed with the philanthropists views. One of those who backed the billionaires opinion was an X user , @AdloveGlobal, who claimed Nigerians pay the lowest tax in the world. Nigerians pay the lowest tax in the whole world, the user tweeted in response to Mr Gates comment published by Channels TV. Mr Gates has been the subject of intense debate in Nigeria, with many conspiracy theories surrounding his involvement in the economy of African countries. Considering the topicality of the claim and its potential impact, DUBAWA decided to scrutinise it and ascertain its veracity. There are different levels of taxation ranging from personal income tax to value-added tax (consumption tax) and capital gains tax among others. For proper contextualisation of this report, the various categories of taxes will be explained below: Action Aid describes Personal Income Tax (PIT) as a direct tax levied on personal income including wages, salaries, directors fees, dividends, royalties, and rental income. Lawpadi explained that the rate of income tax payable is dependent on the amount of taxable income that the person (individual, business, community, family) is liable to pay. It explained that taxable income is some or all items of income minus allowable expenses and deductions. Personal Income tax in Nigeria is deducted in two ways: Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Self-assessment tax. The PAYE is usually deducted from an employees income while the latter applies to self-employed people. Personal Income Tax is collected by The federal government and the Internal Revenue Service in the states are in charge of collecting personal tax. However, the Federal Inland Revenue Service collects taxes from residents of the Federal Capital Territory, as well as from highly mobile federal workers, such as staff of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, other Nigerians, and foreigners living abroad but earning income in Nigeria (non-residents), among others. The rate for PAYE in Nigeria is as follows: Meanwhile, workers with an income of 30,000 ( 70,000 effective from 1 May 2024) or less are not required to file tax returns. According to data from trading economics, Nigerias personal income tax is not the lowest compared to other countries . For instance, Kuwait , the United Arab Emirate , and Oman do not impose any personal income tax on employees. Saudi Arabia , the Bahamas , and some other countries do not also impose taxes on personal income; however, there are certain exceptions, as seen here and here . Compared to Nigerias 24% at the maximum, countries with lower tax rates include Romania , which has a personal income tax rate of 10%. Income tax in Belarus is pegged at 13%, however, there are certain variations as seen here . Hungary has a 15% tax rate for personal income and individuals can enjoy some tax-exempt benefits listed here . Personal Income Tax in Ukraine is also pegged at 18% +1.5% military tax which applies to all incomes. It also applies to passive incomes such as capital gains, interest, and royalties. It is worth noting, however, that there are countries with higher personal income tax (PIT) rates than Nigeria. That said, Nigerias PIT rate is among the lowest globally but not the least. This refers to taxes charged on the things a person buys. It includes sales tax, use tax, excise tax, and value-added taxes (VATs). Value-added tax is charged on goods and services, levied at each stage of a supply chain. It is borne by everyone in the supply chain: manufacturer, wholesaler, dealer, retailer, and customer. It is distinct from sales tax , which is majorly charged to the final user by the retailer. Note that some countries of the world name these levies interchangeably, some refer to theirs as Good and Service charge, General Consumption tax, etc. However, information from PwC reveals that several countries have lower consumption tax rates than Nigeria. For instance, Oman and the United Arab Emirates have a 5% rate, while Jersey Island also has 5%. In Timor-Leste, the sales tax on imported goods is 2.5%, and in Myanmar, although there is no VAT, an indirect tax (commercial tax) is applied at a general rate of 5%. This is the tax collected from companies. It is levied on the profits of a corporation. Investopedia explains it to be a tax paid on a companys taxable income, which includes revenue minus expenses. Under the Nigerian Companies Income Tax (CIT) Act, every company incorporated under the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) is required to file Company Income Tax returns annually, irrespective of the profit or loss position. The CIT rate is 30% for large companies (companies with gross turnover greater than 100 million assessed on a preceding year basis (i.e. tax is charged on profits for the accounting year ending in the year preceding assessment). The CIT rate is 20% for companies that earn between 25 million and 100 million. A company that earns less than N25 million naira is exempted from this tax. However, Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) is charged on the income of companies engaged in upstream petroleum operations in lieu of the Corporate Income Tax. A breakdown is provided below: Meanwhile, in some other countries of the world, the CIT is lower than that of Nigeria like the United Arab Emirate where the Corporate Tax is pegged at 9% for taxable income above AED 375,000; 0% for taxable income below AED 375,000 and a different tax rate (not yet specified) for large multinationals that meet specific criteria set concerning Pillar two of the OECD. In the United States, the current Corporate Income Tax rate on resident corporations has been pegged at 21%, effective from December 2017. The CIT rate in Poland and Mauritius are 19% and 15% respectively though there are certain exceptions as seen here and here . While there are various arguments about the functionality of the tax system in Nigeria, a report issued in July 2024 found that about 89% of the informal sector pays some form of taxes to their local councils and bodies. Put together, businesses in the informal market contribute over half of Nigerias GDP. This is evident in their revenues with the bulk of them (72.3%) hitting monthly revenues of over N1,000,000 monthly, the report by MoniePoint partly reads. Meanwhile, in May 2024, the federal government noted that it was working on a system that would provide tax relief to 95 per cent of the informal sector. While Mr Gates statement about Nigerias tax collection system may be accurate, especially when considering the tax-to-GDP ratio , the claim by the X user that Nigerians are the least tax-paying citizens is false and misleading.",1
"CLAIM: According to Egalitarian Voice Media and Enterprises , PDP deputy governorship candidate Mr Festus Akingbaso claimed that thugs invaded Idanre Local Government Area during the ongoing governorship election. FINDING: An Arise news report published on Nov. 13, 2024, claimed that thugs had invaded Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State, causing mayhem in the neighbourhood. The state police commissioner, Abayomi Oladipo, has ordered an immediate investigation. However, reacting to the allegation that thugs again invaded Idanre LGA on election day, Police Public Relations Officer Ondo State Police Command said she was unaware of the attack and that there were police officers on the ground Idanre LGA.

"Claim : A viral video making the rounds on social media, mainly on WhatsApp, depicts Dino Melaye expressing his support for Peter Obi, the Labour presidential candidate, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The viral video making the rounds on social media, mainly on WhatsApp, depicting Dino Melaye expressing support for Peter Obi, the Labour presidential candidate, ahead of the 2023 general elections is false. The video is taken out of context from an original version that was shared by Dino Melaye. Its a few months away from the general elections in Nigeria. As expected, social media is already agog with the narratives and discourses of politics. Consequent to this reality, a viral video making the rounds on social media, particularly on WhatsApp, featured politician and former senator Dino Melaye eulogising and expressing his support for the Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi. Mr Melaye, a former senator with a history of controversy, said in the acclaimed video that Mr Obi is the best candidate to unify Nigeria. He added that the movement should continue and everyone should be part of it. I wanna say, it is time for us to think. I encourage the crusade. The movement started by Peter Obi to continue, move from campus to campus, move from community to community, move from one progressive group and organisation in this country to another to campaign for the new Nigeria that is to come and be part of the movement, Mr Dino was posed to have said in the 38 seconds video. The video was traced back to a Tick-Tok account, @lolabearose, with the tag: Thank you, Mr Dino, for always saying the truth. The claim has already garnered a significant amount of interactions, over 600 views, 300 likes and 80 comments. One user, @tapcurrent, apparently in consensus with the post, commented that PDP might merge with Mr Obis Labour party. Hahahahaha, they have started to revise the truth. Dont be surprised that PDP will merge with LP. Another user, @user kingh, hinted that Mr Malaye might switch from PDP to LP hopefully. Mr Dino is coming into the Labour party this week by God grace and u are going to handle that aspect of the campaign, the user stated. There is some doubt as to the credibility of the video; just two days ago, Mr Malaye reinstated his support for PDPs presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar. This twist now casts a reservation on the heralding claim. DUBAWA first analysed the acclaimed video on Deepware , a tool used to determine whether a video is a deep fake. Results from the analysis verified that the video is not a deep fake but an actual one. Further to that finding, DUBAWA also subjected the clip for analysis on InVid video verifier. Results from the video fragmentation revealed the acclaimed video was taken out of context from an original and more extended version. On 1st July 2022, Mr Melaye shared a 6:35 minute video of himself with the caption: Obi is a fantastic and a good man, but he lacks the capacity to unify Nigerians. In the video, Mr Malaye pledged his support for PDPs Atiku Abubakar and downplayed Mr Obis candidacy ahead of the 2023 general election. Mr Malaye further stated that Mr Atiku is a unifier and outlined some qualities which he believes make Atiku the best candidate to be president. So we need one Nigerian. Who is going to be trusted by every part of this country, who the north will believe in, who the south will believe in and that person without blinking eyes is Atiku Abubakar, he asserted in the video. Mr Malaye did say the exact words in the acclaimed video. However, the context was attributed to Mr Obis role as Atikus Vice President when the duo unsuccessfully ran for the presidential elections in 2019. The acclaimed 38 seconds clip was taken from the original video that is six minutes and twenty-five seconds long (6:25). Excised exactly at 4:30 4:58 timing of the original version to paint a somewhat different narrative. In fact, Mr Melaye had further shared the same YouTube video on his Twitter account with the caption: WATCHSDM. Peter Obi is Fantastic and a good man, but he lacks capacity to unify Nigerians. Unity is more important than cutting cost of governance. The viral video making rounds on social media, depicting Dino Melaye expressing his support for Peter Obi, the Labour presidential candidate, ahead of the 2023 general elections is false. The video was taken from a more extended version that has little to do with the acclaimed narrative.",0
"CLAIM: Remas calm down was played during the coronation of Prince Charles III. VERDICT: False. The missing scenes in the video imply that the video clip has been edited. Meanwhile, Remas Calm Down was not included in the list of songs sung at the coronation at Westminster Abbey. Also, a closer examination of the video clip shows that the congregation are not uttering the same lyrics as Remas song while the King is being led out of the Abbey. An Instagram user Notjustok.com ( @notjustok ), has uploaded a video showing the moment King Charles III was crowned King of England, with Afropop singer Remas 2022 Calm Down playing in the background. Along with the video was the caption: I still cant believe this happened at the coronation. King Charles III ascended the throne following the death of Queen Elizabeth II , who died on September 8, 2022 . Upon her death, her son, King Charles, immediately assumed duties as the Head of State of the United Kingdom (UK) and 14 other countries. He was crowned King of England on May 6, 2023, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Reverend Justin Welby, in Westminster Abbey, London. The video shows the Archbishop placing the 365-year-old King Edwards crown on the new sovereign. After that, the Archbishop faced the king and proclaimed, God save the King! while the rest of the congregation echoed the chant, God save the King! Suddenly, Remas sensational Calm down bounces off an unseen disc-jockey box, with the ceremonys attendees echoing the song as the King and the Archbishop process along the aisle. The post has garnered over 24 thousand likes and 716 comments. In the comment section, some other users believed the clip to be genuine, and others dismissed it as lacking originality. Jack_the_king_of_money expressed pride that the song, written by a Nigerian and purportedly sung at the coronation, makes the country a force to reckon with. Nigeria to the world (!) We (are) going far out (with) music, a part of his comment reads. Not real. (I)almost fell for it. Another user, iam_daradolapo , disbelieved the video. Due to the sensitivity of the post, and its implications on public opinion, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. When DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search on the alleged video using Invid Video Verifier, the results revealed that the same video had been shared on YouTube by the American-based television network Cable News Network (CNN). However, the CNN version of the video featured different music. In the live footage provided by CNN, labelled as being filmed from Westminster Abbey during the coronation of King Charles II, Archbishop Justin Welby first blessed the crown and offered prayers for the Kings prosperity. He then crowned King Charles II. Following this act, the Archbishop chanted, God save the King! while the congregation echoed his words, accompanied by the solemn tune played by the Coronation Brass Ensemble. It is worth noting that the background song heard in the video was not Remas Calm Down but rather Wiener Philharmoniker Fanfare, composed by Richard Strauss. DUBAWA also observed that the purported video skipped the segment where King Charles and the congregants listened to blessings read out by the clergies before the King was led to another part of the hall to take his seat. Furthermore, it was noted that the lips of the audience members in the video were not synchronised with Remas song. It appeared the congregation was singing an entirely different song while the King and the Archbishop led a procession. Lastly, DUBAWA investigated the list of procession songs sung as King Charles II and Queen Camila left the Abbey. According to Classic FM, the songs included Edward Elgars Pomp and Circumstance and Hubert Parrys March from the Birds. False. Remas song Calm Down was not played at the kings coronation.",1
"Claim: A video circulating on WhatsApp has an accompanying claim a lady and some police officers have been murdered during the ongoing #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria Verdict: Misleading ! The WhatsApp video is a gunmen shootout, which occurred in Irete, Owerri-West, Imo State, on Monday, Jul. 29, 2024, and claimed the lives of four police officers and a POS operator. Credible news outlets have also reported the incident. Amidst a recent anti-government protest a public outcry against unfavourable government policies, including fuel subsidy removal and free naira floating a video of a murdered woman and police officers has been circulating on Metas WhatsApp. It follows the claim that it is linked to the #EndBadGovernance protest. The incident has been claimed to have occurred in one of Abujas suburbs, Maraba. DUBAWA subjected the video material to Google Lens scrutiny and discovered the video file was earlier uploaded on X on Monday, Jul. 29, 2024. The X user, @NwaneriKendrick , who uploaded the video, stated that the gory incident was the outcome of a gunmen raid in Owerri West, Imo State. DUBAWA conducted a Google search about the incident and found a news report published by The Cable . According to the report, gunmen had stormed Blossom Hotel checkpoint in Irete, Owerri-West Local Government Area (LGA) and shot sporadically at police officers who were conducting a stop-and-search operation. Four police officers died from the encounter, as well as a Point of Sale (POS) operator. Punch and Vanguard have also reported the incident. The claim is misleading.

"A popular medical doctor and social media influencer, #OurFavOnlineDoc (@DrOlufunmilayo) on Monday said that Oyo state IGR increased by 26.4% without increasing taxes. He also claimed that Governor Nasir el Rufai of Kaduna state plans to tax everyone above 18 in his state. Seyi Makinde promised his government will never increase tax on any Oyo citizen. NBS report showed Oyo State IGR increased 26.4%, despite no extra taxes. But El Rufai plans to tax everyone above 18 in his state- though he has not given everyone jobs. he wrote in a tweet The tweet has since generated almost 2,000 retweets. CLAIM 1: Oyo State IGR increase by 26.4% without increasing taxes TRUE . Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that Oyo State generated 17.7billion naira revenue in the first half of year 2020 higher than the N14 Billion naira it generated in the first half of 2019. CLAIM 2: Governor Nasir el Rufai plans to tax everyone above 18 years in Kaduna TRUE. Kaduna State government plans to tax everyone above 18 years 1,000 naira annually from 2021 CLAIM 1: Oyo State IGR increase by 26.4% without increasing taxes Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) is the revenue that state governments generate within the areas of their jurisdiction. The various sources of internal revenue available to state governments include taxes, fines and fees, licenses, earnings & sales, rent on government property, interests and dividends, among others. Although the claimants did not state a period he was referring to, we based our verification on data for the first half (H1) of 2020 given that he made the claim shortly after Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, posted the same claim on his Twitter page. Efforts to make a definite clarification with him was unsuccessful as messages sent to him were unreplied. The Nigerian Bureau of Statistics (NBS) H1 2020 report shows that our IGR grew by 26.4% even amidst this pandemic. We did this without increasing the tax burden on our citizens. What we have done so far is to focus on our competitive advantage, Makinde wrote. However, data from the National Bureau of Statistics show that Oyo state generated N17.7billion in the first half (H1) of 2020, higher than the N14 Billion it generated during the same period of 2019. Also, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, Oyo state revenue in the H1 of 2020 grew by 26.4% compared to the same period in 2019. Conclusion: Data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that Oyo State generated 17.7billion naira revenue in H1 of 2020, higher than the N14 Billion naira the state generated in H1 2019. CLAIM 2: Governor Nasir el Rufai plans to tax everyone above 18 years in Kaduna Kaduna State Internal Revenue Service (KSIRS) had on November 10th announced that the state will begin charging adults a compulsory 1,000naira as Development Levy. Payment of Development Levy is compulsory, citizens of Kaduna State from 18 years and above are entitled to pay their development Levy into Kaduna State Revenue Accounts, its your civic responsibility to pay your N1,000 as Development Levy. it posted on its Twitter handle. Later, in an interview with DailyTrust, the executive chairman of KSIRS, Dr Zaid Abubakar, said the Economic Development Levy, which the organization will begin collecting from residents in 2021, will motivate the people to be entrepreneurs instead of staying idle. Conclusion: True.

"Claim: American actress Kerry Washington is married to an Igbo man, Nnamdi Asomugha. Verdict: TRUE! Available news reports reveal that Ms Washington is married to a Nigerian named Nnamdi Asomugha. We also found pictures of the couple and their wedding certificate to collaborate on the story. Kerry Washington is an African-American actress, born on January 31, 1977. She is a television show producer and film director known for her roles in Scandal and Ray, amongst others. Femi Ajibode posted on Facebook that Ms Washington is married to an Igbo man, a Nigerian-American named Nnamdi Asomugha. In the post, Mr Ajibode noted that her husband inspired her to embrace Nigerian culture. The actress told InStyle in 2015, Nnamdis parents are Nigerian immigrants. His father passed when he was young. When you marry into the Igbo culture, you get a new name. My name is Ogechi. I wear it on a necklace my mother-in-law gave me. The couple also gave their children Igbo names. Their daughters middle name is Amarachi, and their sons middle name is Kelechi, the post wrote. Some commenters doubted this. Megan Aderoju, in the comments, replied, I believe she has Igbo ancestry too. Plus, since we know her now, her parents arent her biological parents. She may also have some Ethiopian or Somalian genes with that forehead since everyone is claiming Nigerian. Another user questioned the posts authenticity, stating she did not know the actress was married. I didnt know Kerry was married, let alone have kids with a Nigerian man. Never seen them kids or husbands on her IG page. Ive seen her share moments about her dad but never about her marriage or the kids. I do not believe this. Other comments on the post made us know that people are unaware of the marriage as Ms Washington is very private. The page has garnered 112,000 likes, 303 comments, and 2500 shares since it was posted on Jan 31, 2024. The personalities and virality made us verify the claims authenticity. According to a report by People , an entertainment company, Ms Washington married her longtime sweetheart, Nnamdi Asomugha, in 2013. People entertainment described the wedding as a close, intimate one. In the pairs ten years of marriage, Ms Washington and Mr Asomugha have scarcely been seen together, and she has only opened up about their relationship a handful of times. In another news by New York Daily News , Mr Asomugha met his wife when Ms Washington performed in the play Race on Broadway in 2009. Although we know the origins of their love story, Asomugha and Washington go to great lengths to keep the rest private, the news reported. Mr Asomugha was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, and moved to Los Angeles at three. His childhood was spent making frequent trips to Nigeria, where his family is from. He retired from playing professional football in 2013 after spending eight years playing with the Philadelphia Eagles and San Francisco 49ers. Mr Nnamdi wedded the actress after meeting her when she performed in the play Race on Broadway in 2009. According to the newlyweds marriage certificate, exclusively obtained by E! News from Idahos Office of Vital Statistics, Mr Asomugha swapped vows with Ms Washington on June 24, 2013, in Hailey, Idaho. We also went through the actresss Instagram page to see if we could find pictures of the couple but only saw a few pictures of the couple here with former American President Barrack Obama and his wife. During the movie premiere of Sylvies Love, in 2020, a page on Instagram posted the couple together at the event. When we crosschecked the actresss Instagram page for the same event, we saw she only shared a picture of herself with the caption proud wife moment. Kerry Washington is indeed married to a Nigerian man. They got married in 2013 in a private country home.",1
"Claim: A Facebook page claims that Bukayo Saka has returned to training ahead of the Champions League quarterfinals. Verdict: Misleading! Available media reports suggest Saka could return to the field after the international break and surgery. However, the image shared alongside the claim has been online since 2023. On Dec. 21, 2024, Arsenals star winger Bukayo Saka sustained a hamstring injury during Arsenals 5-1 victory over Crystal Palace, which has left the England international sidelined for weeks. Sometime in February, the football ace had shared photographs of himself stepping up in rehabilitation. Amid this situation, a Facebook page, Declan and Saka Arsenal , shared a post claiming that Saka has returned to training ahead of the UEFA Champions League clash against Real Madrid. Bukayo Saka is back and training for UCL. Pray for Madrid. The Facebook handler wrote. The claim made on Friday, Mar. 21, 2025, was shared alongside the image of the 23-year-old allegedly engaged in a rigorous training session. As of Friday, March 21, 2025, the post had accumulated over 31,000 likes, 387 comments, and 47 shares. Moreover, similar claims were shared on Facebook ( here , here , here , and here ) and X here . DUBAWA noticed that users on X identified the wingers picture shared as not recent. This isnt a picture from the latest training, @haamaaan wrote. Fake, this photo, @attackerfc77 pointed out while @sxmafc warned, Dont spread fake news. Due to the virality of the claim and comments indicating that the shared picture was not recent, DUBAWA decided to verify it. DUBAWA conducted a Google keyword search to verify the information and found multiple reports predicting his return since his recovery from surgery. According to Sky Sports on Sunday, March 16, 2025, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said in an interview that Saka has a good chance of returning to the field after his international break. This makes him available for the upcoming UEFA Champions League quarter-final matches against Real Madrid, scheduled for April 8 and April 16. On Thursday, March 20, 2025, Talk Sport reported similar developments, adding that Saka had undergone individual drills and light training sessions. However, none of the above news outlets posted the picture shared by the claimant, which suggests that England International is fully back on its feet. Furthermore, a Google Reverse Image Search of the picture shows that it is not recent, as the Facebook claimant portrayed. An X post indicates the Arsenal star shared a similar image of the player on June 25, 2023 Meanwhile, we noticed the image was also recirculated in 2024 on social media, as seen here and here . Available news reports show the claim is misleading. The image accompanying the claim has been online since 2023, before Sakas injury in 2024.",0
"Posts circulating on Facebook claim that judge Haruna Tsammani has asked Nigerians to forgive president Bola Tinubu for his alleged drug crime. A 8 September 2023 post features the judges photo and a quote that reads : Since Jesus can forgive and forget why cant you forgive Tinubus drug crime. Tsammani is a judge at Nigerias Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC). He led the panel that heard the petition filed by opposition leaders, challenging Tinubus victory in the February 2023 presidential elections. On 6 September, the court upheld the election of Tinubu as president. The drug case referred to is likely a 1993 matter that saw Tinubu forfeit US$460,000 to the US government. Its alleged he was involved in money laundering and drug trafficking, but he was never convicted on drug trafficking related charges in the US. The opposition leaders who challenged Tinubus February 2023 win brought up the drug case, saying Tinubu should not have contested the presidential election. The same quote has been attributed to Tsammani here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . But did Tsammani ask Nigerians to forgive Tinubu for his drug crime? We checked. Such a quote would show the judiciary was not impartial or independent. But Africa Check found no reports by credible media agencies that Tsammani made this comment or anything like it. If he had, it would have made headlines. There is also no comment like this in the final ruling of the presidential tribunal headed by Tsammani. The Facebook post does not mention when or where the judge might have made the comment. This lack of detail also raises suspicion. There is no indication Tsammani has asked Nigerians to forgive the president.",0
"Claim: Ronaldo is getting married on Tuesday, April 2, 2024, according to a Facebook user. Verdict: Insufficient evidence. Georgina Rodriguez, Ronaldos girlfriend and mother of his children, has only teased that she could get married in May. However, she did not mention the name of the football star she was about to get married to. In 2022, former Manchester United star and five-time Ballon dOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo hinted he is open to marriage to his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez, but has sidestepped the reality of his intention by stating it was not in his immediate plans. A Facebook user, Simplesports , recently posted that Ms Rodriguez, who has been with the Portuguese international since his stint at Real Madrid, has announced a wedding date. Simplesports wrote, Cristiano Ronaldo is getting married today. Along with the caption is a wedding invitation indicating that an anonymous individual, represented by a love emoji, will marry Ms Rodriguez. The ceremony is purported to occur in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, May 5, 2024, by 7:00 PM. The post has already earned over 34,000 likes and 572 comments and has been shared 1,200 times as of Tuesday, April 2, 2024. DUBAWA surveyed the comments that followed the post and realised that while some believed the assertion, others did not. Congratulations, they (would) both make a beautiful couple. Viva Amor, Marilyn Marmol commented . Although I have been waiting forever for this, I think this is fake, Ute Kokomma Okoh commented . Due to the virality of the post, DUBAWA decided to verify it. DUBAWA looked at the invitation details and noticed that despite the mention of a rendezvous for the wedding, there was no mention of the grooms name. Formal wedding invitation cards typically contain the name of the groom and bride, who is about to wed, but this did not. This is important because it not only reveals their identity but that of the families to be joined in holy matrimony. Moreover, sports news outlets, such as Essentially Sports and Sports Brief , have largely dismissed the announcement as a speculation, without any certainty. DUBAWA also viewed Mr Ronaldos Instagram page, where he is an active user with about 627 million followers, but nothing of the wedding details is linked to any of his posts. Besides Ms Rodriguezs teasing announcement on her Instagram story, none of the parties involved has been reported to have said anything further about the speculated development. No sufficient evidence validates or counters the claim that Mr Ronaldo is getting married to his girlfriend, Ms Rodriquez. The wedding invitation does not mention the grooms name, and no report from any parties involved says anything about the event.",0
"Claim : An image shows the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu met the US president, Joe Biden. Verdict : FALSE. The presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, did not meet with US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022. The image being shared with this narrative is doctored. An image of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate for Nigerias governing All Progressives Congress (APC), sitting with US president Joe Biden has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook. A tweet with the image claims it was a picture of Tinubu meeting Biden on November 29, 2022. Happening now: @officialABAT on a courtesy visit to US President Joe Biden as part of his US on international engagements. Obidiots say Tinubu cannot visit the US based on his indictment. He is there right now, live with the US President. Let your Obi visit too. Mumu pipo, the tweet reads. Obidiots is an insulting name given to supporters of Peter Obi, the Labour Partys presidential candidate. Mumu pipo is pidgin for stupid people. Nigeria is set to hold general elections, including for the president, in early 2023. Tinubu and Obi are among the leading candidates for the top job. The image has also appeared on Facebook here , here , here , here , and here . Tinubus candidacy has stirred many controversies, including his alleged involvement in a drug trafficking and money laundering case in the US back in 1993, but his campaign has denied this. But did Tinubu meet Biden in the White House? In verifying the viral image, we saw some telltale signs that it had been doctored. There are significant variations in picture quality, with the part around Tinubu and the man sitting next to him looking blurry. Objects behind Tinubu have their edges rough and overlapping in an unnatural way. This is a red flag because photos of visits to the White House, the official residence of US presidents in Washington DC, are always of good quality. Professional photographers are used for all official engagements. A reverse image search led to several media reports that indicated the original photo came from July 26 2021, a meeting between Iraqi prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and Biden in the presidents White House oval office. The APCs presidential campaign council has debunked the claim that Tinubu met with Biden. A statement by Bayo Onanuga, the councils director of media and publicity, blamed opposition parties for the misinformation. At the time the image was supposedly snapped, he said, Tinubu was in Abuja, Nigerias capital. A viral photograph showing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and United State President, Joe Biden, in talks at the White House is the latest in the series of misinformation being dished out by the political opposition, the statement reads. We cannot just fathom the purpose of the mischief and the falsehood which emanated from the rabid followers of Peter Obi. The apparently photo-shopped image surfaced Tuesday night, on the heels of news that Asiwaju Tinubu will embark on a foreign trip this weekend. Findings show that the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, did not meet with US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022. The image being shared with this narrative is doctored. This report was written by Africa Check and republished by DUBAWA as part of the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition initiative.

"Imagine a small village in northern Nigeria where news spreads quickly through WhatsApp and community gatherings. One day, a manipulated post circulates, claiming that a local political figure plans to betray the community. Although the post is entirely false and its source unknown, it is shared hundreds of times, inciting fear, anger, and even violence. The unknown account pushing a narrative designed to exploit local tensions for foreign interests is a player in Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI). FIMI may mean different things to different people, depending on their backgrounds or the types of information they encounter. However, one thing is clear: it has become a potent tool for spreading disinformation, particularly in regions in which access to reliable information is limited. Grassroots communities, often resource-constrained and dependent on informal networks for news, are especially vulnerable to these tactics. FIMI exploits these vulnerabilities by crafting false stories that are tailored to fit local cultures, politics, and social issues. 1. Weaponizing social media and messaging apps Grassroots communities rely heavily on platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and local community apps for information. FIMI actors exploit these platforms, knowing that information spreads quickly and is often trusted without scrutiny. For example, during the 2024 #EndBadGovernance protests in northern Nigeria, protesters were waving Russian flags, to symbolize regional political interests. Russian-backed movements in nearby countries, like Niger, influenced this display. Social media played a key role in amplifying these actions, spreading disinformation about Russias involvement in local affairs. This situation highlights how FIMI actors manipulate grassroots discontent and amplify political messages through visual symbols, even if those messages dont reflect official foreign policies. 2. Using language and dialect nuances FIMI actors often target grassroots communities using local languages or dialects, making disinformation seem more authentic and relatable. For example, a fake message written in a communitys dialect about government plans to impose new taxes on farmers land might seem personal and trustworthy, especially when shared by local contacts in local languages. 3. Using local Influencers and proxies Trusted community figures such as teachers, religious leaders, or local celebritiesare often co-opted by FIMI actors to spread false information. When respected figures share disinformation, it gains credibility and spreads more widely. For instance, a respected local teacher or religious leader might unknowingly share a misleading post claiming a health risk to the community. Because of their authority, people tend to believe and pass along the message without question. 4. Targeting knowledge gaps Many grassroots communities have limited access to formal education or reliable information. FIMI actors exploit these knowledge gaps by spreading content that sounds authoritative but is ultimately false. For example, there are existing claims that traditional herbal remedies are more effective than modern medicine for treating malaria. 5. Leveraging fear and uncertainty FIMI actors often target the fear and uncertainty that pervade grassroots communities. They spread rumours about violence, disease outbreaks, or other perceived threats to create panic. For instance, in a conflict zone, FIMI actors might falsely report that a neighbouring ethnic group is planning to attack a local village, to cause widespread fear, panic, and possibly even preemptive violence in response to the fabricated threat. 6. Planting False News through Local Media Local media outlets, which may lack the resources for thorough fact-checking, are prime targets for FIMI actors. These outlets may unknowingly publish or broadcast manipulated content, which can quickly reach a large portion of the community. A local radio station might air a fake segment claiming that government aid has been diverted to foreign countries, causing widespread mistrust among citizens who rely on this aid for survival. Limited Digital Literacy: Many people in these communities lack the skills to critically assess digital content or verify its authenticity, making it easier for FIMI actors to manipulate people in such communities. Trust in Word of Mouth: In close-knit communities, personal relationships often outweigh scepticism about such information. This trust in the messenger makes it easier for false information to spread unchecked. Inadequate Fact-Checking Resources: These communities are left more vulnerable to manipulation with few local fact-checking initiatives or access to independent verification services. How to Counter the Spread of FIMI 1. Media and Information Literacy (MIL) training Educating communities on how to spot fake news is key to fighting FIMI. Simple training sessions can teach people to check sources, spot manipulation, and trust reliable platforms. Programmes like those run by DUBAWA in Nigeria help people build these skills and understand what information to trust. Local fact-checking groups, led by trusted community members, can quickly debunk misinformation. By sharing verified information, they create a ripple effect that helps keep communities informed. 3. Amplify trusted voices Using respected local figures, such as religious leaders or influencers can help spread accurate information. When these voices speak in local languages, the message is more likely to resonate and counter false narratives. Church and mosque gatherings can be effective spaces for this. Supporting local journalists with training and resources helps them report accurately and spot disinformation. Strong grassroots journalism ensures communities get reliable and timely news despite limited resources. Conclusion To effectively curb the spread of disinformation, FIMI should be a primary focus, as its influence reaches small communities by exploiting trust and cultural dynamics while limiting access to reliable information. Thwarting this issue requires collaboration at all levels to empower residents with media literacy skills, support fact-checking initiatives, and amplify trusted voices.",0
"A photo has been posted on Facebook in Nigeria in October 2022 with the claim it shows Lagdo Dam in Cameroon. The caption starts : Here is the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon Causing Annual Flooding in Nigeria. Lagdo Dam is a hydroelectric dam built in 1977 and is located in the North region of Cameroon . Cameroon borders Nigeria to the west. Local news media reported earlier in the year that the National Emergency Management Agency , or Nema, had predicted 32 out of Nigerias 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory , would experience flooding in 2022. Nema is the agency in Nigeria responsible for managing disasters and related issues. It has been widely reported in both local and international media that excess water released from the Lagdo Dam contributed to flooding in some parts of Nigeria in 2022, leading to loss of life and damage to properties. But in October, a news organisation reported that Nigerias water minister Suleiman Adamu said Lagdo Dam contributes only one percent to the flooding in Nigeria, even though sometimes the water is released without notice. The same photo and claim about Lagdo Dam were also shared on Facebook here and here . But is this a photo of Lagdo Dam? We checked. A reverse image search of the photo led us to a post on Wikipedia Commons , which in turn led us to a March 2009 post on Flickr by photographer Dustin Moore . Here the photo is identified as showing Fort Gibson Dam in Oklahoma, United States. The photo circulating on Nigerian social media doesnt show Lagdo Dam and was not taken in Cameroon.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claims Fulani men attacked an 18-seater bus conveying Igbos returning to the East. Verdict: Misleading! Evidence gathered by DUBAWA shows that the images have been online since 2020 and 2023, long before the mob incident in Edo State. Moreover, no media outlet has reported a reprisal attack on the Igbo since the Edo lynching incident. On Friday, March 28, 2025, 16 persons alleged to have been kidnappers and Hausa herdsmen were lynched to death in the Uromi community in the Southern State of Edo. According to reports, the individuals were en route to Kano and travelling in a commercial truck when local security stopped them. Upon searching the travellers, they uncovered guns, which riled a rather irate mob to round them up and take the law into their hands. The incident occurred a few days before the Eid El Fitr celebrations. Amidst concerns of a reprisal attack, a Facebook user, Elder Zegeorkwande , on Sunday, Mar. 30, 2025, shared three images of a burnt vehicle and claimed Fulani men attacked an 18-seater bus conveying Igbo passengers in Kano State back to the East. The Facebook user with over 43,000 followers shared images of a charred bus with the caption; AGGRESSIVE RETALIATION: BREAKING An 18-seater bus carrying Igbo passengers was set on fre in Kano. Panic has spread across the Igbo community in the state as Fulani men go on a rampage, attcking and killing any Igbo they come across in retaliation for the killing carried out by Edo hunters. Tragically, 18 Igbos lost their lives this morning while travelling back to the East. A violent Fulani mob ambushed their bus, set it ablaze, and left no survivors, he further wrote. As of Monday, March 31, 2025, the post had accumulated about 357 reactions, 245 comments, and 23 shares. In the comment section, some users who believed the incident to be true anticipated such an attack, while others dismissed it as false. This scenario came to my mind the moment I came across that video yesterday. May their souls rest in peace. Bearing the consequences of other peoples actions, Orinya Emma wrote. Another user, Sewuese Orkuma , said, This is not a good sign at all. And if care is not taken, this will not end soon. Strongly doubting the post, Elazar Ichenna wrote, Old man like you follow dey report fake news and I think say u legit self. Meanwhile, similar claims were shared here , here , here , here , and here . The contradicting comments and the possibility of a tribal conflict in the country, given the strained relationships between the tribes involved, made DUBAWA investigate the claim. DUBAWA subjected the three pictures shared by the users to a Google Reverse Image Search to know their respective contexts. When we analysed the first image, we came across a report that Punch newspaper published on Sept. 30, 2023. The news outlet reported an auto accident that involved a Toyota Hiace that got burnt, although its passengers had escaped unhurt. DUBAWA noticed that the charred bus the claimant shared on Facebook was the exact vehicle in Punchs report about an inferno in 2023. We also found a video on Facebook that Punch posted on Sept. 30, 2023, showing a complete view of the vehicle involved in the accident. It bears a striking resemblance to the picture the claimant shared. Punch also shared the clip on its Instagram page. We conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the second image and found a report Punch published on Jan. 17, 2020. The news outlet narrated how a commercial bus conveying 19 passengers exploded in Ijebu-Ife on the Ore-Ijebu Ode-Sagamu Road in Ogun State. DUBAWA noticed that Punch had included a picture of the commercial bus in the 2020 report, which is the burnt vehicle the Facebook claimant shared. Channels also reported the same story on Jan. 16, 2020, and included similar images. DUBAWA noticed that the third image shared by the Facebook claimant is the same as the first. Furthermore, we checked for any report of an alleged reprisal attack on Igbos following the recent event but discovered that no reputable media outlet reported such an incident. The claim is false. There are no reports of a reprisal attack on Igbos as a result of the lynching in Uromi. The pictures used to portray the claim are old and unrelated.",1
"As the nationwide protest set for Aug 1st draws near, rumours about the activities of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members have surfaced on WhatsApp. These speculations have since gone viral, spreading to other social media platforms like X and Facebook , with users raising questions about their authenticity. Unverified claims can intensify tensions during periods of unrest. DUBAWA conducted this fact check to set the records straight. Claim 1: Automatic clearance for all corps members in August A screenshot of the viral claim. Photo Source: WhatsApp. DUBAWA spoke to Eddy Megwa, NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, who said that it is true that the corps members would not need to appear physically for biometric clearance in August. However, the NYSC directorate has planned to deploy inspectors who would visit their primary place of assignment to verify their presence before clearing them for the month. He said, On the issue of biometric clearance, we have our administrative procedures for giving our corps members their monthly stipend. We have inspectors that monitor corps members in their various places of primary assignment. Now, the Director General has also approved the deployment of more inspectors from the directorate headquarters, state secretariats, area offices, and zonal offices to ensure that the corps members are doing their services where they are posted. Now, instead of allowing them (the corp members) move around during this period of protest and in the process, they are caught in between, the Director General now instructed officers to move around and check where they are serving and through that, theyd be cleared and paid accordingly. Verdict: Misleading! While corps members do not need to be physically present for Augusts biometric clearance, inspectors will visit their places of assignment to clear them before they get paid. Claim 2: No corps member should wear uniforms or attend community development service (CDS) meetings till further notice The NYSC Director of Press and Public Relations, Eddy Megwa, confirmed these statements as accurate. In a telephone conversation, he informed DUBAWA that the measures were set by the NYSC directorate to protect the lives of the corps members in its care. If the ones protesting want to do anything to hit the government, corps members become veritable tools, and so we said for this period, as youre moving around, dont wear uniforms so that youll not be a target. All the things we have done are to make sure that corps members are alive during their service and that we deliver them back to their families safely. Its a good thing to do, he said. Verdict: True! The NYSC spokesperson confirmed the claims during a call with DUBAWA.",1
"The Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, tweeted that the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) was created by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). False After a series of protests against the activities of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, in a press briefing on October 11 announced the disbandment of the infamous unit of the Nigeria Police Force. In reaction to the announcement and continued protest, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Yekini Nabena, tweeted that the unit is a creation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Who created SARS? PDP, he wrote in a tweet suggesting that the unit was established during the PDP administration. The PDP ruled at Nigerias federal level from 1999 when the country returned to democracy and 2015. As of Tuesday afternoon, the tweet had garnered 401 retweets, 168 likes and 468 comments. While majority commenters appear to know this claim to be false, few believe it is true. A Twitter user, Sokunle Muiz Tosin with handle @ThisIsShoksman tweeted, So APC was blind for 5 years? It took oppressed young Nigerian to make you do the right thing #Shameful. Another user, named New Nigeria and tweeted via his handle @GemstoneMD said: whatever!!! Our cry is just that #SARSMUSTEND. One of those who thinks the claim is false, Godwin German, tweeted on his handle, @Godwin_German thus: Read the Vanguard newspaper of today. Not PDP. It was a child of necessity that was abused and stigmatized. Alalade Bukola Felix @alaladebukolaf1 tweeted: SARS was created in 1992 and PDP was founded in 1998. Its erroneous to say PDP created SARS. How true is Mr Nabenas claim? Firstly, Dubawa reached out to Mr Nabena but he declined comments on the ownership of the unverified handle and the claim.It should be noted that the handle has been used to issue statements on behalf of APC in the past and such statements were never denied. Information about the creation of SARS cannot be found on the website of the Nigeria Police Force, even SARS can be found as a section under the Force Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (FCIID). A report by Vanguard traced the creation of SARS to 1992 during the General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida military junta. A retired Commissioner of Police, Simeon Midenda, who was quoted in the December 23, 2017 report said the unit was created through his effort. In the report, Midenda was quoted as saying SARS was founded by me in 1992. For a proper understanding of this, historical background to its formation is relevant. Anti-Robbery as the modus operandi of the Nigeria Police Force for combating armed robbery has been as old as the Police Force itself. As a unit also, anti-robbery had always existed in all Criminal Investigation Departments at Force Headquarters, Zonal and State Command levels. To claim that I founded SARS required explanation. Also, it should be noted the PDP, to which Mr Nabena attributed the establishment of SARS did not come into existence until 1998, in the run up to the February 1999 general election which it eventually won. SARS was not a creation of the People Democratic Party (PDP) as claimed by APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary. The police unit has been in existence since 1992.",0
"Claim : A viral video of a man hitting a woman with a pressing iron is alleged to be the scene of Osinachis enduring domestic violence by her husband. Video of a man hitting a woman with a pressing iron that is alleged to be a scene of Osinachis enduring domestic violence by her husband is FALSE. The video has existed since 2020 and has been featured alongside different narratives. As such, this claim is false. Social media went agog with different narratives when late Nigerian gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, was announced dead at an Abuja hospital. Osinachi, who was the lead singer at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre, was initially said to have died from cancer of the throat. However, floods of information and testimonials from social media and some of her close family relatives later alleged the singer was killed by her husband on account of domestic violence which late Osinachi has long been enduring for some time. Fueled by this trend, a video of a man hitting a certain woman with a pressing iron surfaced on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. The footage depicts an apparently irate man hitting a woman with what appears to be a pressing iron. The helpless woman, who is heard screaming in the presence of crying children, is further chased by the man to another room, bringing the 11 seconds video to an abrupt end. The man is alleged to be Osinachis husband domestically abusing her and the caption also suggests the footage was covered by her son. Video of Osinachis husband beating her, recorded by their son. How can a man being an animal be beating his wife this way, your woman mother of your children, how can this idiot deny that he didnt have a hand in killing his wife Osinachi. Mr Peter Nwachukwu, the attached caption points out. In one WhatsApp group where the video was shared, some users shared their disappointment with Osinachis husband, tagging him a demon and an iron man for beating her with pressing iron. This man is a demon. How can you beat your wife with a pressing stone? No wonder she couldnt survive it. May her soul rest in peace, one user wrote. Since the passing of the gospel singer, multiple narratives have been flying around with no factual basis. While this is usual with trending events, some people can capitalise on it to propagate unfounded reality that may sometimes stir up fear or even rage in the society. When DUBAWA ran an analysis of the alleged footage on InVid Video verifier, results show the footage exists since 2020 with a different narrative that has nothing to do with the late gospel singer. In fact, DUBAWA traced the earliest appearance of the video to a Twitter user, David (@Davidnart) who shared the footage on June 21st, 2020 with the caption: This is extremely wicked by this man. I hope he gets locked up for life. Wicked bastard. Not just that, another Twitter user, z (@zubykelz) on June 31st, 2020 also shared the footage with the narrative that the woman in the video has accused the man of rape and not domestic violence. Seems Nigerians are confusing Domestic/Physical abuse (Domestic Violence) with Emotional/Sexual Abuse (Rape). For clarity this video is a case of Domestic violence which she didnt accuse him of she accused him of Rape. She hasnt told us any incident of the Rape (s) though, the caption says. The same video was also published in a report by Pulse.ng on June 23, 2020 with the headline: Viral video of man hitting wifes head with electric iron in front of kids sickens social media users. The report details how the unknown man in the footage is beating up a woman with a pressing iron. Evidently,none of the places the video was featured in 2020 mentioned the late popular gospel singer or her husband as the persons in the footage. The alleged video exists since 2020 and has been featured with different narratives that neither mention Osinachi nor her husband. As such, this claim is false.",0
"Claim: A user on WhatsApp claims that Barack Obama, the former President of the United States, unveiled a banner of Rochas Okorochas 2023 presidential campaign to mark his support. The claim that Barack Obama, the former President of the United States, unveiled a banner of Rochas Okorochas 2023 presidential campaign to show his support is false. The alleged video was doctored from an actual video of Obama unveiling a portrait of himself at the Smithsonian Institute back in 2018. A video making rounds on WhatsApp has a claim that former President of the United States, Barack Obama, has unveiled a banner of Nigerian politician Rochas Okorochas 2023 presidential campaign to show his support. The 30 seconds video clip depicts Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, seated in what appears to be a public gathering. Soon after, the former president was welcomed on stage to unveil an alleged portrait of Rochas Okorochas 2023 presidential campaign. Rochas Okorocha is a senator representing Imo West Senatorial district at the 9th Nigerian Senate. He is also the former governor of Imo State, who has several times contested for the presidency. Although the source of the video could not be traced, Rochas Okorochas campaign website is boldly inscribed on the acclaimed portrait. The relationship between politicians shares no bounds. However, this particular banner unveiled by Obama in support for Rochas was questioned by multiple users on WhatsApp. This video is edited abeg. Obama does not even know who Rochas is, one user wrote in a WhatsApp group. Similar questions in different forms ensued, but in summary, they all seem to seek one answer. Did Obama really unveil a banner of Rochas to show his support for him? DUBAWA uncovered that the alleged video was doctored to fit into the acclaimed narrative. While it was true that Obama was at an event and unveiled a portrait, analysis of video on InVid video verifier showed it was not the campaign banner of Rochas Okorocha but a portrait of Obama that was presented to him in 2018 at the Smithsonian Institute. The actual unveiling event was covered and shared on the Smithsonian Institute YouTube page with the detail: The Smithsonians National Portrait Gallery unveils its commissioned portraits of former President Barack Obama and Mrs. Michelle Obama by artists Kehinde Wiley and Amy Sherald, respectively. Remarks by President Obama and Mrs. Obama, Smithsonian Secretary David Skorton, National Portrait Gallery Director Kim Sajet and artists Wiley and Sherald. The alleged video of Obama showing support for Rochas Okorochas 2023 presidential aspiration is fake. The clip was doctored, and it is not in any way related to Rochas or his political aspirations.",0
"With only a few weeks to the end of his tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari and his team have continued to reel out what they considered as major achievements of the government while efforts are on to ramp up some initiatives before leaving office. On April 26, 2023, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) anno unced the approval of an Action Plan 2022 to 2026 to promote and protect human rights in Nigeria. Speaking at the event, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said the approval followed Mr Buhari administrations compliance with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) judgement and payment of N135 million compensation to victims and family members of the September 18, 2013, Apo-six killings. As you will recall, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has established a record of being the first and only administration in the history of Nigeria that has indeed tolerated, accommodated and enforced the decision of the Human Rights Commission, the minister said . The minister, citing a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said Nigeria is the only African country in 2022 that has been in full compliance in terms of the protection of the rights of journalists. He further claimed that no journalist had died in Nigeria under the Buhari-led administration due to infractions relating to their work. You are equally aware that the committee for the protection of journalists, which is an international committee, had equally adjudged Nigeria as the only African country last year that has been in full compliance in terms of the protection of the rights of the journalist taking into consideration that not a single incidence of death of a journalist has been recorded in Nigeria arising from infractions, relating thereto. His statement came amid allegations of human rights infractions against the Nigerian government and censorship against the press in the country. Claim 1: Mr Malami said Nigeria is the only African country in 2022 that has been fully compliant with the protection of journalists based on a CPJ report. In a statement on Friday, the CPJ debunked Mr Malamis claim, noting that the minister misinterpreted its report to drive home his position. CPJs Africa program coordinator, Angela Quintal, condemned the Ministers statement saying, CPJs research on press freedom in Nigeria, showing years of attacks on press members including killings strongly contradicts comments by Attorney General and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami about the press freedom situation in the country. Malamis misrepresentation of CPJ research is particularly alarming and tragically ironic given how frequently Nigerian journalists are accused and prosecuted for distributing alleged falsehoods. The organisation also said the minister had repeatedly misquoted its data to mean Nigeria was doing well in protecting journalists. Data from the Press Attack Tracker also corroborated that journalists in the country have suffered assaults. The tool, initiated by the Centre for Journalism, Innovation and Development (CJID), showed that 52 journalists were victims of an attack in 2022, with state actors accounting for most of these attacks. It further revealed that in the last four years (2019-2022), 179 journalists have been attacked in Nigeria. These attacks are mainly perpetrated by state actors and security agencies, as seen in the chart below. These attacks range from physical assault, unlawful arrest, imprisonment, threats, surveillance, denial of access, Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPPs), equipment seizure/ damage, and even death. In the same year, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nigeria 129/180 in its chart on the safety of journalists. Nigeria is one of West Africas most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists, who are often watched, attacked, arbitrarily arrested and even killed, the report added. The Nigerian government has faced criticisms bordering on policies perceived to undermine the safety and freedom of journalists in the country. Such repressive laws include the Cybercrime Act 2015 , the Defamation Act , the Anti-Terrorism Act, the NBC code, and the NITDA acts. These laws are consistently used to deal with media organisations and journalists. These laws are inconsistent with international standards and have been widely criticised by human rights organisations. For example, the ECOWAS Court ruled that Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act is arbitrary, unlawful, and requires amendment. The suit was brought by Socio-Economic Rights And Accountability Project (SERAP), and it stated that 12 cases of alleged victims of harassment, intimidation, arrest, unlawful detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of journalists and broadcasters across several states of Nigeria between August 2015 and November 2018 had been recorded. However, the judgement of the ECOWAS proceedings has not been implemented, which goes against the claim that Nigeria has been compliant with the principles guarding the safety of journalists. We tried contacting Mr Malami to ask for a specific CPJ report he referred to, but our calls and text messages were not replied to. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2023, being an election season, preliminary findings by PTA show at least 45 journalists were attacked, with physical attacks accounting for most cases recorded. Verdict: False. According to data from the Press Attack Tracker, 52 journalists were attacked in Nigeria in 2022. Also, Mr Malamis reference to the CPJ report was used in a misleading context. Claim 2: Not a single incidence of death of a journalist has been recorded in Nigeria arising from infractions, relating thereto Mr Malami. A 2021 report released by the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) stated that eight journalists had been killed under Mr Buharis administration. However, not all eight died during the discharge of their duty as journalists. The report reads, For example, in 2017, four journalists were killed in separate incidents with no credible inquiry yet to find the culprits and their motive for the fatal attacks. The four were a cameraman with the Anambra Broadcasting Services, Ikechukwu Onubogu; Lawrence Okojie of the Nigeria Television Authority in Edo State, a Desk Editor with Glory FM in Bayelsa State, Famous Giobaro and freelance broadcaster in Ekiti State, Abdul Ganiyu Lawal. Four more journalists have since been killed under circumstances that have yet to be clarified through credible investigations. The killing on July 22, 2019, of Precious Owolabi, a reporter with the Channels Television in Abuja while covering a protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria-IMN, was agonising. Mr Owolabis death had occurred while discharging his duties. Alex Ogbu, an editor with the local independent outlet Regent Africa Times, suffered the same fate when he was killed at a protest in Abuja on January 21, 2020. All these happened during the President Buhari administration. Meanwhile, data from the Press Attack Tracker showed that 610 journalists had been attacked in Nigeria from 1985 to date. Of this figure, 21 journalists have been killed in the country. The first recorded case was that of Dele Giwa. Plights of some families of the slain journalists can be found in this report . Verdict: The claim that no journalist has been killed in the line of duty under the Buhari administration is false. At least two cases were documented within the eight years of the regime. Mr Malamis claim that Nigeria is the only African country fully compliant with the protection of journalists in 2022 and that no journalist in the country has died from work-related infractions is false. The Press Attack Tracker and other media reports showed journalists are still endangered in the country.",1
"Claim: A viral image circulated via Metas WhatsApp groups asserts that asbestos ceilings are cancerous and have been banned in several countries. Verdict: TRUE. Findings reveal that some countries have banned the use of asbestos within their territories. Also, medical professionals have confirmed to DUBAWA the health hazards that asbestos can cause. Asbestos is a common building material used for insulation, ceiling and roofing. Before the Plaster of Paris (POP) became commonplace, the asbestos ceiling was popular among households. However, a viral image is being circulated via groups on Metas WhatsApp that the asbestos ceiling can cause cancer, thus causing it to be banned from most countries. The caption on the image reads, Living under asbestos ceiling is bad for your health. It is cancerous to your health and has been banned in most countries. This claim has been shared multiple times on WhatsApp. Due to the virality of the post across the platform, DUBAWA decided to verify it. According to the National Cancer Institute , asbestos has tiny fibres in them. When these tiny fibres escape into the atmosphere, people breathe them in, and it promises them long-term health hazards. These fibre particles become trapped in the lungs, and when they become accumulated, they cause scarring and inflammation. These conditions can trigger serious health problems for them. The paper also reports the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which mentions sufficient evidence that asbestos causes mesothelioma (cancer of thin membranes which line the chest and abdomen) and cancer of the lung, larynx, and ovary. However, IARC also mentions that there is limited evidence on whether asbestos causes stomach, pharynx and colorectal cancers. The American Cancer Society (ACS) also corroborates that outcome. In an Asbestos.com article written in April, international health organisations are disclosed to have canvassed for a global ban in 2010. The paper also discloses that the World Health Assembly asked the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2007 to launch a global campaign to end asbestos-related diseases. This was an indirect campaign against countries that still use asbestos. Furthermore, at the 66th World Health Assembly in 2013, the WHO proposed a global action meant to be sustained between 2013 and 2020. It enumerated a set of policies that would manage and curtail non-communicable diseases, one of which was putting an end to the worldwide use of all types of asbestos. According to the International Ban Asbestos Secretariat , 55 nations have banned asbestos. Asbestos Nation also reiterates this but notes that China, Russia, India, and Canada are exempt. Asbestos has been banned in several countries, except for Mexico, according to the Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency In an interview with Dr Nwamaka Lasebikan, President of the Association of Radiation and Clinical Oncologists of Nigeria (ARCON) at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, she confirmed that asbestos exposure can actually lead to serious health problems, including cancer. Asbestos exposure can increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including lung cancer, mesothelioma , and other cancers such as those of the larynx and ovaries. Dr Lasebikan stated. She further mentioned that inhaling asbestos fibres can endanger certain organs in the body because these fibres can (be) trapped in the lungs, which could cause inflammation and scarring. Dr Lasebikan also stated that people who live under the asbestos ceiling are at risk of experiencing health problems due to the potential release of asbestos fibres into the air. She further explained that asbestos-containing materials, such as those used in ceilings, can deteriorate over time, releasing microscopic fibres into the air that can be inhaled or ingested. These fibres can (lodge) in the lungs or other tissues, leading to inflammation, scarring, and genetic damage to cells, which can increase the risk of developing cancer and other diseases over time, she said. Dr Tessy Ahmadu, a radiation consultant and clinical oncologist at the Federal Medical Centre, Abuja, also identified some of the asbestos-related health hazards. She stated that long-term exposure to asbestos fibre can increase the risk of certain cancers such as lung cancer, mesothelioma, ovary and larynx cancer. She mentioned that those who are likely to encounter these risks are workers whose jobs are associated with asbestos mining, asbestos textiles and other asbestos products. This risk is much higher in workers whose jobs are associated with asbestos milling and mining, asbestos textiles and other asbestos products, Dr Ahmadu said. The radiation consultant, however, pointed out that asbestos ceilings may not be a direct risk unless particle material from the asbestos infiltrates the body and comes in contact with the lining of the organs mentioned above. She also added that studies have shown no safe levels of asbestos exposure. The claim that asbestos ceilings are cancerous and have been banned in several countries is true.",1
"A post on Facebook claims that VAT in Nigeria has risen sharply from 7.5% to 10%. The post reads : Just in: Value Added Tax has just been increased from 7.5% - 10%. Fuel price and VAT increased in one day. Value added tax , or VAT, is a consumption tax levied on the value of goods and services. VAT in Nigeria is levied on all taxable goods and services that are supplied in or imported into the country. In 2020 , the Nigerian government increased VAT from 5% to 7.5%. In March 2023 , former finance minister Zainab Ahmed advised the current government to raise VAT from 7.5% to 10%. In June 2024 , the chairperson of the presidential committee on tax and fiscal reforms, Taiwo Oyedele, said that the proposed plan to raise the VAT rate from 7.5% to 10% would be implemented in phases. Similar claims of an increase can be found here and here . (Note: See more listed instances at the end of this report.) In September, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company increased its pump price from N617 to N897 per litre. Did the government follow suit in inflicting economic pain on Nigerians by raising VAT from 7.5% to 10%? We checked. Ignore message, says minister Wale Edun is Nigerias minister of finance, with more than four decades of experience as a banker, economist and financial advisor. On 9 September, in a statement signed by Mohammed Manga, the director of information and public relations at the ministry, Edun denied claims that the government had increased VAT to 10%. The Federal Government has officially debunked reports suggesting that the President Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led Administration plans to raise Nigerias Value-Added Tax (VAT) from 7.5% to 10%, the statement read . The Federal Ministry of Finance remains committed to transparent communication on all tax and economic policy matters, ensuring that citizens are well-informed and not misled by unfounded reports.

"Mental health is simply our emotional, psychological, and social well-being, including how we think, feel, and act. Although this topic has, over the years, become more popular, there are still several misconceptions and myths around it that promote stereotypes in Nigeria. This article highlights some of these misconceptions and states the facts. Myth 1: Mental health issues are not common Verdict: FALSE According to Devora Kestel, the Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use in the World Health Organization (WHO) Mental Health Report 2022 , mental health conditions are common in all countries. Still, in most societies, health and social systems neglect it. The Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital Yaba, in Lagos State, according to a report by Punch , attended to 77,071 psychiatric patients at various outpatient pharmaceutical service points in the hospital in 2022. This is just from one state. In 2019, the WHO revealed that one in every eight people in the world lives with a mental disorder. In 2019, a news report identified that Nigeria has a mental health challenge as the Federal Neuropsychiatric Hospital Yaba experienced a 22 per cent increase in new patients. The report revealed that one in four Nigerians suffer from mental illness, but help is inadequate due to small budgets and a lack of skilled staff. Also, in a 2016 report by WHO on Suicide in the World, Nigeria had the highest suicide rate, with 17,710 suicides of all ages. A Psychologist, lecturer and founder of the Psychebabble Foundation , Sandra Anyahaebi, also confirmed the report on the percentage increase in Yaba and revealed a 50% increase in the number of patients struggling with substance abuse. According to a 2016 study, Nigeria has the highest number of depressed people in Africa, with over 7 million out of the 29.19 million depressed people in Africa. Myth 2: Mental health issues cant affect me Verdict: FALSE Depending on different factors, anyone can experience a mental health disorder . The WHOs Fact Sheet on mental health notes that a diverse set of individual, family, community, and structural factors can combine to protect or undermine a persons mental health. While some people are more resilient to these factors, people exposed to adverse circumstances like poverty, violence, disability, and inequality are at higher risk. Individual psychological and biological factors, such as emotional skills and genetics, also reduce or increase risk factors. Myth 3: People with Mental health issues are violent or mad Verdict: MISLEADING The American Psychiatric Association (APA) listed some warning signs for mental illness, and none of it includes violence or madness. Although Ms Anyahaebi agreed that people with mental health illnesses can sometimes exhibit violent behaviours, she said they are not always violent. Individuals with mental health issues may exhibit symptoms of violence or aggressive behaviour, but that is when they are experiencing an episode, not literally all the time. When you say mad, it is derogatory and stigmatising, so we dont use that anymore in the mental health field to refer to a mental illness or condition because it makes people not want to seek help or speak out, she added. In a report by Cable in 2022, the president of the Association of Psychiatrists in Nigeria (APN), Taiwo Obindo, revealed more than 60 million Nigerians are suffering from mental illnesses, but that does not mean they are mad. An article by Better Health , a website managed by the state government Department of Health in Victoria, Australia, revealed that psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia can sometimes be associated with aggressive or violent behaviour. However, people living with schizophrenia are no more violent or dangerous than the rest of the population if they are receiving effective treatment and not misusing alcohol or drugs. These people, the article noted, are more likely to express their aggression, agitation or frustration towards themselves or to family and friends, not strangers. The article also identified some triggers for people with this condition. These triggers include; ineffective treatment, a patient with a previous history of violence, misuse of alcohol or other drugs, fear, experiencing psychotic symptoms for the first time, or unfamiliar experiences. Myth 4: Panic attacks can be fatal . Verdict: FALSE The United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) defines panic attacks as intense fear and anxiety that happens if/when people feel anxious about something happening or experience a difficult or stressful situation. An article by Medical News Today noted that panic attacks can be scary but not fatal. However, there might be long-term health complications, as revealed by this 2005 study. The study suggested that panic attacks may worsen heart problems in people with coronary heart disease (CHD). The founder of the Psychebabble Foundation also said that panic attacks are not fatal except if the victim has other underlying conditions. Panic attacks are not fatal, although when a person is experiencing a panic attack, it feels like they are going to die, it feels that way, but in reality, they are not fatal and cant kill you. Panic attacks alone cant kill you except the person has preexisting conditions that are somehow showing up. Myth 5: Children dont experience mental health issues Verdict: FALSE According to the WHO, around 20% of the worlds children and adolescents have a mental health condition, with suicide as the second leading cause of death among 15 to 29-year-olds. Also, the APA reveals that 50% of mental illness begins by age 14 . Myth 6: People with mental health issues cant keep a job or live normal lives Verdict: FALSE According to the National Alliance on Mental Illnesses (NAMI) , mental illness is not an obstacle to employment; it is correlated with success in certain professions. NAMI also noted that several employment support programs that help people with mental health illnesses get and keep jobs prove that people with these issues can keep a job. The Academy of Management Insights journa l shows how bipolar disorder overlaps with entrepreneurship. Ms Anyahaebi agreed that this assertion is false as she knew several persons with diagnosed mental health conditions are still hitting their career goals. I know people who are CEOs and have been diagnosed with mental health disorders. I know people at the top management level who have been diagnosed with one mental health condition or another. So it comes back to our culture and society, she explained. Myth 7: People with mental health issues are weak or lack willpower Verdict: FALSE An article by UNICEF debunking several myths about mental health noted that a mental health condition has nothing to do with being weak or lacking willpower. Ms Anyahaebi agreed with UNICEFs stand stating that people with mental health are not weak. Myth 8: Mental health issues are permanent Verdict: MISLEADING While some mental health issues like Schizophrenia do not have a cure, Ms Anyahaebi said it does not mean they are permanent. I would say no because there are some mental health issues that do not have a cure, things like schizophrenia and the like. However, she explained that many mental health-related concerns or mental health issues have management tips and treatment options, but some mental health disorders do not have a cure, she explained. According to the Agape Treatment Centre , theres no cure for mental illness, but many effective treatments exist. The centre also added that people with mental illnesses can recover and live long and healthy lives like others with diabetes. Myth 9: Therapy is a waste of time Verdict: FALSE Recommended mental health treatments include psychotherapy, medication, hospitalisation, support Group, complementary and alternative medicine, self-help plans and peer support. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) noted that treatment for mental health conditions varies depending on the individual. It is important to note that many people do best when working with a support system during healing and recovery. The Psychebabble Foundation founder disagreed with the assertion that therapy is not a waste of time. Myth 10: People with mental health issues are possessed . Verdict: FALSE A complex interplay of individual, social and structural stresses and vulnerabilities determines your mental health. For example, peoples individual psychological and biological factors, such as emotional skills, substance use and genetics, can make people more vulnerable to mental health conditions. The Psychebabble Foundation founder, Ms Anyahaebi, said if you cant call someone with fibroid or an injury possessed, then a person with mental health issues is not possessed. No. Would you say someone with a fibroid or an injury on the hand that got infected and they have to amputate is possessed? No. A person with a mental health disorder is not possessed. As we have identified above, there are a lot of contributing factors to mental health issues. Mental health issues are common and should be taken seriously by everyone. If you or anyone you know suffers from mental health conditions, please do not hesitate to ask for help. Different organisations in Nigeria provide assistance, including Mental Health Foundation Nigeria , Mentally Aware Nigeria Initiative , and the Psychebabble Foundation .",1
"Claim: A Facebook user alleged that popular Liberian musician Maurice Tosh Gayflor, who goes by the stage name CIC, won $1 million US dollars from Lonestar Cell MTN for winning Artist of the Year and $7000 US dollars for winning Male Artist of the year. Verdict: False! Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberian musician CIC did not receive $1 million for Artist of the Year, nor did he win the Male Artist of the Year category. The MTN Liberia Music Award (MLMA) was established in 2009 to celebrate artists who continue to push boundaries and showcase Liberias rich musical diversity. The 2024 MLMA edition was held on December 14th at the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Ministerial Complex in Congo Town, Monrovia, and presented awards in more than 20 categories . These categories included Producer of the Year, Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, New Artist of the Year, Gospel Song of the Year, Gospel Artist of the Year, and Afropop Artist of the Year, etc. Since the conclusion of the award ceremony, widespread claims have circulated on social media regarding the cash prizes and categories won at the 2024 MLMA. One such claim was made by a Facebook user, JNB , who posted on January 29, 2025, that: CIC just won $1 million United States dollars from Lonestar Cell MTN for winning Artist of the Year and $7000 United States dollars for winning Male Artist of the Year. This information has garnered significant attention, with 682 reactions, 96 comments, and three shares as of Feb. 11, 2025. Due to the widespread circulation of this claim, DUBAWA decided to investigate as part of its commitment to combating misinformation and disinformation. Verification Based on the nature of the claim, DUBAWA investigated two key aspects: DUBAWA first checked the list of all winners per category at the 2024 MLMA. This check revealed that CIC did not win the Male Artist of the Year award, as speculated. Instead, he won five other award categories: The Male Artist of the Year award was won by Jonathan Lee Pratt, popularly known as JZyNo. Also, DUBAWA reviewed the official Facebook page of Lonestar Cell MTN, the official sponsor of the 2024 MLMA, to verify the actual cash prices awarded to CIC. In a January 29 award post, Lonestar Cell MTN posted that CIC received : Conclusion Social media claims that CIC won $1 million from Lonestar Cell MTN for Artist of the Year and $7,000 for Male Artist of the Year are false. Official records from the 2024 MLMA and statements from Lonestar Cell MTN confirm that CIC did not win the Male Artist of the Year award. The cash prizes awarded were $7,000 for Artist of the Year and $3,000 for Song of the Year, along with data bundles.",1
"Claim: A WhatsApp audio allegedly features the Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Kanayo Uzuegbu, announcing that security agencies will monitor the WhatsApp chats and calls of Nigerians. Verdict: False! DUBAWAs findings show that the Nigerian Police or any other law enforcement agencies cannot independently monitor Nigerians WhatsApp or Facebook calls and messages. The end-to-end encryption feature of these platforms makes it impossible. An audio recently circulated on WhatsApp with claims that the Nigerian police will now monitor the chats and calls of WhatsApp and Facebook users. The speaker, alleged to be Kanayo Uzuegbu, the Commissioner of Police, Enugu State, warned that messages directly attacking any official brand will receive two blue ticks and one red tick. He also said messages directly insulting the government or official personnel with a court order will receive one blue tick and two red ticks. WhatsApp and WhatsApp calls will be monitored starting tomorrow. All calls will be recorded, and all call recordings will be saved. WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all social media will be monitored. Your devices will connect to the ministrys system. Nobody should speak against the government; doing so can lead to arrest without a warrant. The police will ensure notification, then be secreted by very serious cybercrime, the speaker said. A screenshot of the viral audio. Photo source: WhatsApp. Whether or not insulting government officials is considered a criminal offence has been a debate on X in the past few days. This was further aggravated by the recent arrest of an activist who allegedly cursed the presidents son, Seyi Tinubu. As if that is not enough, Muyiwa Adejobi, the Nigerian Police Spokesperson, also tweeted that cursing someone online is a punishable criminal offence. Mr Adejobis controversial tweet. Photo source: X. But whether he was aware or not, the law he referred to had already been repealed, and that sparked a controversy among lawyers who called Mr Adejobi ignorant. DUBAWA conducted this fact-check due to the audios virality and potential for misinformation. If true, it would not be strange for an event of that nature to dominate the news. However, DUBAWA observed that no news platform reported that security agencies would now monitor social media platforms. We found that this claim is not new, as a similar version has been in circulation since 2020. For instance, a Facebook user, Oluseyi Babatunde , posted it on his timeline on Feb. 5, 2020. Oluwole Coker , another Facebook user, shared the same claim on April 20, 2020. Likewise, Chinwendu C. E Rays shared the claim on May 29, 2024. DUBAWA also found that the Enugu State Police Command has debunked the viral audio. In an October 31, 2024, statement on its X handle, the command clarified the audio was misleading and announced an investigation to identify and arrest its originators. The statement partly read, The Enugu State Police Command is aware of a viral audio recording featuring the photograph of the Commissioner of Police, purportedly sharing new communication rules for WhatsApp chats and calls. The Command strongly condemns this audio, labelling it as misleading and malicious. The public is advised to disregard the audio, as it does not represent any official communication from the Command. It is essential to note that WhatsApp, owned by Meta, is a reputable international organisation that would not use such third-party sources to announce changes to its services. WhatsApps privacy policy emphasises the protection of user messages through end-to-end encryption, which ensures that only the sender and recipient can read messages. This means that WhatsApp itself, as well as its parent company Meta, cannot access the content of personal conversations, including chats, calls, and shared locations. Additionally, users have control over their privacy settings, allowing them to manage who can view their profile picture or last seen status. These methods, put together, are how WhatsApp ensures that personal conversations remain secure and private from unauthorised access. Contrary to the claim made in the audio, there is no such thing as a red tick on WhatsApp chat indicators. A single non-coloured tick means the message has been sent, while double non-coloured ticks indicate the message has been delivered. Double blue ticks show that the receiver has read the message. On the flip side, if the receiver has turned off their read receipts, the double ticks will remain non-coloured even if the message has been read. While all these are obtainable, WhatsApp does share metadata with law enforcement agencies when legally required . This metadata can include information such as the users phone number and the duration of service but does not reveal the content of conversations. WhatsApp has a dedicated Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT) that evaluates government data requests and asserts that it only complies with valid legal requests. Government agencies from all over the world send WhatsApp requests for user data. We share details about these requests and our responses twice a year in Metas Government Requests for User Data Report. WhatsApp requires government agencies that make requests to comply with applicable law, our policies (including our Privacy Policy), and, in certain scenarios, to use the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty process, WhatsApp privacy policy reads. WhatsApp cannot and does not produce the content of its users messages in response to government requests. The content of all messages sent using WhatsApp is protected by the same Signal encryption protocol that secures messages before they leave your device, which ensures only you and the person youre communicating with can listen to or read what youre sending, and nobody in between, not even WhatsApp. Our findings reveal that neither the Nigerian Police nor any other law enforcement agency can independently monitor WhatsApp or Facebook calls and messages due to the platforms end-to-end encryption, which makes such surveillance impossible.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed that white onions soaked in water can clean the eyes and improve eyesight. Verdict: MISLEADING. While onions possess nutrients that can improve eyesight, experts say soaking them in water for days does not produce such desired effects. A Facebook user, McMfresh, posted a video on May 23, 2024, claiming that white onions soaked in water can improve vision. He informed viewers to soak a combination of white and red onion (containing a larger amount of white onion) in water for days. Afterwards, persons with weak vision should drink water containing white and red onions in the morning and at night to tackle eye defects like cataracts, glaucoma, short-sightedness, long-sightedness, and myopia. The post has gathered more than 24,000 reactions, 1,400 comments, and 7,100 reshares. The comment section is predominantly filled with inquiries about the appropriate portion of onion and how long it should be soaked in water. One Omotayo Akinmusewe said, Faulty presentation. No clue as to the mix of ingredients and the usage. Another comment from one Ebere Awogu asked, Will l filter the onion water drink, or will l drink everything? Other comments asked if warm or cold water is preferable and if the onions should be boiled before usage. However, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim because of the issues raised by commenters. The eye, a delicate part of the body system, can experience different medical defects. Myopia (nearsightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), astigmatism (distorted vision at all distances due to an irregular cornea or lens), presbyopia (an age-related condition that makes focusing on close objects complex), cataracts, and glaucoma, among others, are typical eye conditions prevalent among young and old. Genetics, ageing, and lifestyle choices generally contribute to eye defects. Environmental influences, such as prolonged UV light exposure and pollution, also play a role. Other medical conditions like diabetes and hypertension impact eye health, while trauma can cause or worsen defects. Medical experts have emphasised the eyes delicacy. According to the American Academy of Ophthalmologists (AAO), minor eye injuries and environmental exposures can progress into more serious eye conditions that can significantly impact vision if not adequately addressed. Early detection and appropriate treatment are crucial for maintaining good vision and managing eye defects effectively. Onions, botanically known as Allium Cepa, are a root vegetable reputable for its health properties . They are high in antioxidants and sulfur-containing compounds, some of which may have several beneficial effects. The sulfur in onions aids eye health by stimulating the production of a glutathione protein. This antioxidant protein reduces the risk of glaucoma , macular degeneration, and cataracts, protecting the lens in the eye and improving vision. The vegetable also contains selenium , which supports vitamin E in protecting the cells in the eye. Onion extracts can also help prevent the development of corneal haze. Temiloluwa Omotosho, a seasoned nutritionist, revealed that the natural plant is used for numerous health conditions. She said, Onions are good antioxidants and prevent cell damage. I agree if you tell me that onion works for digestive problems, skin health, or eye health. However, DUBAWA found no academic research that validates drinking onion water to cure eye defects, and the medical experts we contacted also debunked the claim. DUBAWA contacted Jovi Boparai, an American ophthalmologist and Corneacare s chief executive officer, who revealed that no scientific research backed such a claim. He said, Onions may contain some vitamins and minerals that would be helpful for eye conditions, but no scientific literature supports such claim as a cure for eye diseases. Ive never heard of that, and Ive never used that in my practice. He also warned people to beware of unorthodox treatment, especially for delicate cases like glaucoma and cataracts. You can go blind from [glaucoma]. The last thing we want is for somebody with glaucoma to treat themselves using onion water and think that its improving things when its not. Glaucoma, along with cataracts, is one of the leading causes of blindness globally. Its vital to see an eye doctor to get the proper treatment, he said. Lucy Owulo, a dietitian at the Federal Ministry of Health, debunked the claim, stating that it lacked scientific evidence. She urged people to disregard the information and related claims, saying they are called food fads in nutrition. Ms Temiloluwa also said drinking onion water is good but cannot cure eye defects. She said, It helps to suppress some health conditions in the body, but not using it specifically to treat an eye condition and expect it to be cured. I dont think it has been scientifically established yet. You cant base the treatments of these eye defects on onion water. Though onions contain nutrients that contribute to healthier vision, experts revealed that soaking onions in water for drinking cannot cure eye defects. The claim is misleading.",0

"Claim: A Facebook user recently claimed Nigeria has the fastest train in Africa. Verdict: True! Lagos Red Line Mass Transit rail system boasts trains with a speed limit of 330km/h, which is the fastest in Africa. Globally, infrastructural development remains a key indicator of progress. Therefore, it is no surprise that serious-minded governments allocate a significant portion of their budgets to infrastructure. Increased investment in transport infrastructure, particularly in urban areas, is believed to have a positive impact on national economies. In Africa, the infrastructure gap across countries remains a major topic of discussion in nation-building, particularly among citizens and stakeholders. Recently, a Facebook blog , Africa View Facts, claimed Nigeria has the fastest trains in Africa. Nigeria has the fastest train in Africa, the Red Line Rail. The service is expanding to five trips in the morning hours and four evening trips daily, up from two trips in the morning. The high-speed train runs at 330 km/h, the post caption reads. This elicited mixed reactions from other users who predominantly doubted the authenticity of the information. A user, Atunde Akanbi Wasiu, replied, Go to South Africa, Kenya, Ethiopia, etc. You will see better and faster trains. Another user, Zaidu Aliyu, wrote, Where is the train? Mr Man, we dont even have a train in Nigeria. Other categories of users, however, applauded the country for such a great feat, hoping that this would extend to other parts of the country. DUBAWA observed this exchange and decided to set the records straight. The Lagos Red Line Mass Transit rail system (LRMT) was commissioned by President Bola Tinubu on Feb 29, 2024, about three years after the construction started . Lagos governor Babajide Sanwoolu said over 500,000 passengers would be conveyed daily during the first phase of the project, which stretches 27km from Agbado to Oyingbo, with eight stops at Agbado, Iju, Agege, Ikeja, Oshodi, Mushin, Yaba, and Oyingbo. For the LRMT, the government purchased two Talgo Series 8 train sets, each with a speed limit of 330kmph. The trains were originally built for a high-speed rail line to connect Madison and Milwaukee in the United States of America. Built with the latest technology, it adorns a lightweight aluminium body and compression collision requirements of the Federal Railroad Administration for unrestricted service. The Talgo Series 8 train also provides special features for wheelchair-bound passengers (ADA compliant). Other distinct features include automatically activated exterior and interior interconnecting doors, electrical outlets at all seats for charging laptop computers or other electrical appliances, internet availability, a newspaper and magazine rack for passengers, and one restroom in every second car, with eco-friendly vacuum toilets. Before that, the Al-Boraq rail line in Morocco had the fastest trains capable of reaching speeds up to 320 kph. The rail line was opened in Nov 2018, linking the port city of Tangier with Casablanca. It is worth noting that during pre-service testing on the Al Boraq line, trains peaked at 357 km/hr. However, plans are underway for Alstom to deliver twelve high-speed trains capable of 357kph. These are targeted towards the 2030 World Cup, and the company is scheduled to start delivering the trains in 2027. Meanwhile, the Lagos state government inaugurated the first phase of the 27-kilometre Blue Line rail project, which commenced commercial operations in 2023 with trains running at a speed limit of 80km/hour. Recently, the government signed a memorandum of understanding with the Federal government to start work on the 68-kilometre Green Line rail project, which he said will boost the states transportation system. Other high-speed trains exist in other parts of the world, with the fastest being in China, with a maximum speed of 460kph. The Shanghai Maglev is said to be the only link in the world currently carrying passengers using magnetic levitation (Maglev) rather than conventional steel wheels on steel rails. The claim that Nigeria has the fastest train in Africa is true. The trains on the Lagos Red Line Mass Transit rail system have a speed capacity of 330km/h, the highest limit in Africa as of the time of filing the report.",1

"CLAIM: Twitter suspends Kenyas President account over Nnamdi Kanu arrest The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is false . A Twitter user CorrectBN with handle @correctbn in a tweet on July 1, 2021, claims the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu, the self-styled leader of outlawed movement, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which agitates for a separate state for ethnic Igbos in southeast Nigeria, has been labelled a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government. The IPOB leader, who was facing charges bordering on treasonable felony following his campaign for the secession of Republic of Biafra, had jumped bail in 2017 after a military action, code-named Operation Python Dance, targeted his family house in Abia state His arrest was announced by Nigerias justice minister and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who said it was done in collaboration with INTERPOL. To verify this claim Dubawa began by conducting a search on the microblogging platform Twitter to find out if the account truly existed, which returned a series of parody accounts carrying Kenyas president name and picture. However, a Google search revealed a story published in March 23 2019 about the President temporarily deactivating his social media accounts due to what it termed infiltration by unauthorised individuals. Screenshot of the news on news.cn According to Twitter, when you deactivate your account, it is possible to restore your account for up to 30 days after deactivation. A further search on the handle in question @UKenyatta reveals that it was a parody account created in March 2020 almost a year after the government announced the deactivation of the President Twitter account. This simply means that the username was available and someone took advantage by making a parody out of it. Screenshot of news on the return of the Twitter account Also, in November 2020 President Kenyatta while talking about deactivating his personal Twitter account which reported by Arise tv says he would rather talk to his wife and sleep, because he always gets angered by the insults on Twitter and couldnt sleep. Screenshot of Arise news website with the story The Kenyan Presidents personal twitter account had more than three million followers before it was deactivated and his administration now uses a verified State House account @StateHouseKenya, which has over one million followers. Screenshot of Twitter handle of State of Kenya The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is untrue as online resource material shows that the Kenyan President has deactivated his Twitter since 2019 and the suspended was a fake account of the President created in March 2020.

"Claim: Ghana, Sierra Leone, and 18 other African countries have been banned from travelling to the United Arab Emirates. No official source of communication has corroborated the information that the United Arab Emirates has issued a visa ban on Ghana and Sierra Leone, even though some other African countries like Nigeria have suffered some restrictions on some categories of visas. On the night of Tuesday, October 25, 2022, information widely made the rounds in Ghana that the United Arab Emirates had placed a 30-day visa ban on citizens of Ghana as well as 18 other African countries and one non-African country. According to the information, published by national mainstream news media portals, such as citinewsroom , and international news outlets like The BBC NEWS PIDGIN and DW Africa , effective October 18, authorities from the UAE would not be posting 30 days visa applications for the affected countries. Sierraloaded, an online portal in Sierra Leone, also reported that a ban had been placed on Sierra Leone. Authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have announced a visa ban slapped on Sierra Leoneans and 20 other nationalities seeking to visit Dubai with immediate effect, excerpts of the publication read. Except for the Dominican Republic, all other countries purportedly are in Africa. Aside from Ghana and Sierra Leone, the other countries supposedly affected in Africa include Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Comoros, Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Nigeria, Republic of Guinea, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, The Gambia, and Togo. To ascertain its veracity, DUBAWA has independently verified the information. By the United Nations Security Council Resolutions , a member state can impose a travel ban on listed individuals by preventing transit or entry into their country. These listed persons must be deemed to have committed or are likely to commit acts of terrorism and other human rights abuses. Also, by International Health Regulation (2005) , countries can impose travel bans to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease As part of DUBAWAs verification in Ghana, we combed the website of the United Arab Emirates, but no news was found on the ban. Though Citinewsroom did not name its source, our contact at the online news portal indicates the information was sourced from DW Africa, which, according to our source, was the first to publish the story. But DW Africa itself did not attribute the claim to anyone in particular. DUBAWA then proceeded to verify from official sources at the Embassy. DUBAWAs independent checks at the United Arab Emirates Embassy in Accra have revealed that the UAE has not placed any visa ban whatsoever on Ghanaians. According to Mikdad Mohammed of the Trade and Investment Desk at the Embassy, who is also in charge of media relations, while it is true that the UAE has issued stricter visa terms for some African countries, including Nigeria, it is false that Ghana is part of the affected countries. He explains that the UAE has restricted certain visa categories to, for example, Nigerians under 40, except those applying for family visas, due to their likelihood of overstaying, adding that Ghanaians are exempted from all of those stricter restrictions. He, thus, urges the Ghanaian community to treat the Tuesday information in the public domain as unsubstantiated rumours. You can quote me anywhere. There is no official ban on visa issuance [to Ghanaians]. We are still issuing visas to the public without any hindrance. Stricter visa terms have been issued for some other African countries, including Nigeria, but the same has not been extended to Ghana. Treat news of the visa ban as uninstantiated rumours, he urges. Mikdads information has been confirmed by the Embassy Public Relations Officer (PRO), Haruna Abdul Rashid. When DUBAWA sought to know the nature of the relationship between Ghana and the United Arab Emirates, Mikdad replied that a solid tie exists between the two countries. In Sierra Leone, DUBAWA reached out to Mohamed Massaquoi, Press & Information Attache for Sierra in the UAE , through his Facebook Messenger to verify the statement and determine the conditions under which those bans, if true, were imposed. There is no ban on Sierra Leoneans, as of this time of responding to you! Massaquoi replied, adding that the UAE has not communicated any information regarding a travel ban on Sierra Leone to the Embassy. The Press Attache on the alleged UAE travel ban on Sierra Leoneans at the Embassy vehemently dismissed the assertion concerning the travel ban on Sierra Leoneans, adding that such information has not come to the notice of the Embassy. The attention of the Sierra Leone Embassy in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been drawn to social media reports claiming the UAE Government has issued a visa ban on Sierra Leoneans and several African nationals. The Embassy wishes to state that it has NOT received any information on the same from official sources in the UAE and therefore considers the said reports being circulated as false and misleading, the release disclosed. Consequently, we encourage all Sierra Leoneans planning to visit the UAE on tourism and business purposes to go ahead with their visa applications as planned, the press statement added. DUBAWA also contacted Sierraloaded, the platform that published the story, to find the source of the claim, but there has since been no response from the media organisation. According to official information, the United Arab Emirates has not issued any visa ban for Ghanaians and Sierra Leoneans willing to emigrate to that country.",1
"Claim: An X user shared a video of bodies allegedly recovered from the Maiduguri flood incident in Borno State. Verdict: Misleading! DUBAWAs investigation shows that the video is from a terrorist attack in Yobe State, not Maiduguri. The collapse of the Alau Dam, Maiduguris main water source, caused devastating flooding that submerged several homes, particularly along the citys coastal area in Borno State. In the aftermath of the disaster, there has been a spate of visual content online, showing the States before-and-after conditions. On Sept. 11, 2024, a social media user on X posted one of such videos claiming that it showed the dead bodies of Borno residents killed by the flood incident. Do Humans Live In Aso Rock! Frame one: dead bodies killed in the Maiduguri flood being evacuated from the scenes, parts of the description attached to the post read. As of Sept. 12, 2024, when DUBAWA scrutinised the post, it had generated 6,000 views, 60 reposts, 98 likes, and 14 bookmarks. DUBAWA opted to conduct this fact check to curb potential tension during a crisis like this. DUBAWA carefully examined the video and spotted an inscription on one of the small trucks conveying the carcass that read Mafa. With this information, we conducted a keyword search, which shows that Mafa is a community in the Tarmuwa local government of Yobe State. Further, we extracted screen grabs from the video and used them to conduct a Google Lens image analysis. Results indicate that the video has been online even before the flood crisis. The video shows the aftermath of terrorist violence in Yobe State. See here , here , and here . We checked media reports to authenticate if there were recent occurrences of bandit violence in Yobe State. DUBAWA found a Daily Trust report dated Sept. 3, 2024, which informed that Boko Haram insurgents who attacked the Mafa village killed many residents and set several homes and shops ablaze in Yobe State. Similarly, AlJazeera and ThisDay newspaper reported similar stories. The claim that the video shows dead bodies from the Borno flooding is misleading and untrue. The scene is from the terrorist attack that occurred days ago in Yobe State before the flood hit.",0
"Claim: Tope Fasua, a Facebook user, shared a video of what appears to be Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, lamenting over his experience behind bars, after he was arraigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for online financial fraud. The video purportedly of Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, lamenting over his experience behind bars, after he was arraigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for online financial fraud, is fake. Analysis of the video showed it was a deep fake created for a comedy YouTube channel. Ramon Olorunwa Abbas is a popular personality in Nigeria. Last year, his name took over the headlines after he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for charges relating to online financial fraud, what is popularly referred to as yahoo-yahoo in Nigeria. Over months that followed the arrest, Hushpuppi has triggered multiple discourses and has also been a point of controversy. Recently, a Facebook user shared a video of what appears to be Hushpuppi lamenting behind bars and sharing his experiences in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The alleged video depicted Hushpuppi chattering about the amount of money found in his apartment and also claiming to still be in possession of $250 million that is kept in his apartment untouched. He was also depicted to express his regret snapping and spending money with politicians that have now abandoned and deserted him. In the comments section of the post, one user commented, Guy man, just calm down and do your time jejely. Another commenter said, FBI don chop you. Just cool down, do your time in 20 years and you will see the green grass of home. Majority of the comments seem to resonate with Hushpuppis situation, signalling a sense of consent to the videos originality. Even more, the video has been seen by over 4,000 users, calling for verification of the claim. To verify the originality of the alleged video, DUBAWA conducted a search on Google to find any related report to the alleged video, but none was found. However, the video was traced to a comedy YouTube channel, @akposthecomedian where it was identified as having been originally shared a year ago. In the video, the facial attributes of Hushpuppi are marred by obvious adulteration. This is evident in the words uttered by the supposed Hushpuppi. The sound of his voice clearly does not conform with the movement of the lips. Also, the eyes of the supposed Hushpuppi also signalled another red flag. As his speech gets emotional, his pupils have no human presence. His eyelashes jolted inconsistently throughout the video. Our general assessment of his facial features shows that the supposed Hushpuppi was a deepfake. This is also evident in the lips of the supposed Hushpuppi, exhibiting different colours as he lamented. These findings led DUBAWA to conduct an analysis of the alleged video on Deepware (an online tool that identifies deep fakes). The results showed that it was a deep fake; in fact, both versions of the video from Facebook, and the original source were both found to be deepfakes. The alleged video has been in existence on social media since 2020 and was only reshared by a Facebook user to revive the narrative. The video is also doctored as revealed by Deepware and was deliberately created by a Youtuber to generate clicks from viewers. Hence, this claim is fake.",1
"Claim: The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, stated that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias GDP. Verdict: True On Thursday, November 10, 2022, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu claimed that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He made this assertion while speaking at a town hall meeting with the mining and agro-processing stakeholders in Lafia, Nasarawa State. During the meeting, the presidential candidate lamented that Nigeria was well-endowed, given its industrious, energetic population and vast inventory of land, water, and other natural resources. He said that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be derived as the value of all goods and services available for final use and export. During election campaigns, politicians are fond of quoting figures to swing public sentiment in their favour, and it is incumbent that politicians be held accountable for what they say. Hence, we decided to check the veracity of the statement. Having thought of the imperative of verifying the veracity of this claim, we sought to identify the volume of the solid minerals in Nigeria, at least in 2021. First, we sought evidence from the 2021 mineral production report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which revealed that the grand total of solid minerals production at the end of 2021 was 89,482,541.07, suggesting an increase of 39.19% from 2020 outputs which stood at 64.29 million tons. The report, released in July 2022, also added that Limestone, Granite, and Laterite were the three biggest minerals mined in 2021. What does this translate to in monetary value? How much contribution does the total output add to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product? To answer these questions, we proceeded to find more evidence. According to the NEITI audit released in 2020 (the 2021 audit report is being awaited), Nigerias total GDP in 2020 was 152.32 trillion, with the solid minerals sector contributing N686.64 billion, representing 0.45%. In 2021, according to World Bank data and Trading Economics analysis , Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion , a value which represents only 0.05 per cent of the world economy. Yet, despite this increase, the Central Bank of Nigerias Economic Report for the third quarter of 2021 affirmed that the solid minerals sector contributed the least to Nigerias GDP growth with a mere 0.01 US Dollar = 4.4 Nigerian Naira (NGN). And what does the CBN figure translate to in terms of percentage contribution to national GDP? Dataphyte analysis of the NBS report shows that the mining and quarrying sectors total contribution to the GDP increased from 368.9 billion in 2019 to 1.101 trillion in 2021. This means the sectors contribution to the countrys GDP increased from 0.26% in 2019 to 0.45% in 2020. In 2021, the sector, having increased in productivity to 89,482,541.07 million tons, still contributed 0.63% to the total GDP of 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion . In March 2022, the executive secretary/CEO of NEITI, Dr Ogbonnaya Orji, also confirmed that Nigerias solid mineral sector was contributing less than one per cent to the nations GDP , having risen from 0.18% in 2018 to 0.29% in 2019. Based on information from multiple sources, Bola Tinubus claim that solid minerals contribute less than one per cent to Nigerias GDP is true.",1
"Claim: Multiple sources have portrayed Nigerias new Chief of Army Staff, Major General Faruk Yahaya, as the 26th Chief of Army Staff (COAS) but the Nigerian Army claims he is the 22nd. The claim that the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Faruk Yahaya, is the 26th COAS is false as findings show that the nomenclature COAS only came into existence in 1975, thus making Lt. General TY Danjuma the first COAS and General Yahaya the 22nd. On Thursday 27th May 2021, Major General Faruk Yahaya assumed command as Nigerias new Chief of Army Staff after the demise of his predecessor, Lieutenant General Ibrahim Attahiru, who died on May 21st 2021 in an air crash in Kaduna, alongside 10 military officers and crew. The Nigerian Army had issued a statement by its Director , Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima, announcing the passing away of Gen Attahiru stating that the COAS was enroute Kaduna from Abuja when the unfortunate incident happened. The Chief of Army Staff is the highest-ranking military officer of the Nigerian Army and the position, often occupied by the most senior commissioned officer, is appointed by the Nigerian President. On May 27, President Muhammadu Buhari appointed Major General Faruk Yahaya as the Chief of Army Staff (COAS). Until his appointment, Gen Yahaya was the Theatre Commander, Operation HADIN KAI, which is responsible for Counter Terrorism and Counter Insurgency operations in the North East of Nigeria. Some online media outlets such as Fast News , Opera News and Society Gazette as well as Nigerians on social media had portrayed General Yahaya as the 26th COAS, but the Nigerian Army on the 28th of May 2021, announced that Major General Faruk Yahaya had assumed command as the 22nd COAS at the Army Headquarters (AHQ) in Abuja. However, controversy arose as to whether the present COAS is the 22nd or 26th Chief of Army Staff to hold the office and serve as Nigerian Armys most senior officer. The same designation was replicated on social media. A user on Twitter, Angela Davis (@angeldaviesblog) wrote: How Major General Faruk Yahaya became Nigerias 26 th COAS. Another user, 774NGR (@774_ngr) also wrote on Twitter: There is now a new man at the helm of affairs in the Nigerian Army. He is Major General Faruk Yahaya, and he is the 26th Chief of Army Staff since the Military first got a taste of political power back in January 1966. On the website of the Nigerian Army, under the office of the COAS, the profile of the immediate past COAS, Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru, had him addressed as the 20th and in another instance as the 21st COAS, further complicating the issue. This has left many Nigerians wondering what number the present COAS is. In our quest to verify the various claims, it became important to start with the history of the Nigerian Army which dates back to 1863 with Lt. John Glovers local force which became known as the Glover Hausas and later the Hausa Constabulary. It later became the Lagos Constabulary and on incorporation into the West Africa Frontier Force (WAFF) in 1901, became known as the Lagos Battalion. According to the Nigerian Army website, the British Government had already included the Royal Niger Company (RNC), Constabulary Force in Northern Nigeria in 1886 and the Oil Rivers irregular in 1891 into the WAFF. The WAFF led to the merger of all units into regiments in each of the dependencies and this produced the Northern Nigerian Regiment and Southern Nigerian Regiment. The 1914 amalgamation of Nigeria which brought the Northern and Southern Protectorates together also unified the Northern and Southern Regiments to become the Nigerian Regiments. However, the Nigerian Regiment was renamed the Queens Own Nigerian Regiments (QONR) in 1956 during the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and in the same year, the regionalization of the WAFF came into existence and each military force became independent of the other. According to the Nigerian Army, the QONR became the Nigerian Military Force (NMF) and by 1st June, 1958, the British Army Council in London relinquished control of NMF to the Nigerian Government while in 1960, when Nigeria became independent, the NMF became known as the Royal Nigerian Army (RNA). The RNA changed to the Nigerian Army in 1963 when Nigeria became a republic. Several online records have portrayed Kenneth G. Exham as Nigerias first General Officers Commanding (GOC) followed by Major General Norman Foster, then Major General Christopher Welby-Everard and Major General Aguyi-Ironsi who was the first indigenous GOC. This is also corroborated by a report published by The Premium Times in 2014 titled: General Minimah, his Opobo ancestry and the burden of history, written by Eric Teniola. Based on the report, Nigeria at that time had 28 COAS including the early British GOCs. The report portrayed Lt. Col. Yakubu Gowon as the first COAS followed by Lt. Col. Joseph Akahan, Maj. Gen. Hassan Usman Katsina, Maj. Gen. David Ejoor, Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma, Lt. Gen. Ipoola Alani Akinrinade, Lt. Gen. Gibson Jalo, Lt. Gen. Mohammed Inuwa Wushishi, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, Lt. Gen. Sani Abacha, Lt. Gen. Salihu Ibrahim and Lt. Gen. Aliyu Gusau Mohammed. Others include Maj. Gen. Chris Alli, Maj. Gen. Alwali Kazir, Lt. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi, Lt. Gen. Victor Malu, Lt. Gen. Alexander Ogomudia, Lt. Gen. Martin Luther Agwai, Lt. Gen. Owoeye Andrew Azazi, Lt. Gen. Luka Yusuf, Lt. Gen. Abdulrahman Bello Dambazau, Lt. Gen. Onyabor Azubuike Ihejirika as well as Maj. Gen Kenneth Tobiah Minimah. Since Minimah, Lt. General Tukur Buratai has held the position before he was replaced in January 2021 by Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru who has now been succeeded by Major General Faruk Yahaya, making the list 31. Other online documents show that it was not until 1966, under then Lt. Col Yakubu Gowon that the official designation of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) came into existence, therefore referring to Lt. General Yakubu Gowon as Nigerias first COAS. With this, between 1966 and 2021, it can be verified that Nigeria has had 26 Chiefs of Army Staff (COAS) with late Lt. General Ibrahim Attahiru as the 25th and Major General Faruk Yahaya as the 26th COAS. Using oral records from senior military officers of the Nigerian Army and archival records, however, it was verified that what is today referred to as the Nigerian Army officially came into existence in 1963 after it changed from the Royal Nigerian Army. Within that period, Major General Christopher Welby-Everard became the first GOC of the Nigerian Army between 1963-1965. He was replaced on 9th February 1965 by General Aguyi-Ironsi who served as the GOC until 16th January 1966. However, further verification revealed that General Yakubu Gowon who took over in 1966 from General Ironsi was not referred to as GOC or COAS; instead, he was referred to as Chief of Staff Army. Gen. Yakubu Gowon, Lt. Col. Joseph Akahan, Maj. Gen. Hassan Usman Katsina, and Maj. Gen. David Ejoor were each referred to as Chief of Staff Army (CSA), not Chief of Army Staff (COAS), said the Director, Army Public Relations, Brigadier General Mohammed Yerima when contacted. A chronicle of the Nigerian Army Command published in the 2021 diary of the Nigerian Army corroborates this. This makes Lt Gen. T.Y. Danjuma the first COAS. Between Lt. Gen. T.Y. Danjuma and Lt Gen. Ibrahim Attahiru, there have been 21 COAS, making Major General Faruk Yahaya Nigerias 22 nd COAS. The claim that the new Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Major General Faruk Yahaya, is the 26th COAS is incorrect as the nomenclature, COAS only came into existence in 1975 during the administration of General Ramat Murtala Mohammed when he appointed General T.Y. Danjuma to be the first COAS. Therefore, General Faruk Yahaya is the 22nd COAS as findings have shown.

"Claim: Bryan Harris, a social media user, posted in Liberian Policy Forum, a Facebook group, alleging that the Investigation Report about the Capitol Building fire disaster linked the incident to natural causes and electric shock. Verdict : False! The International Investigators report on Capitol Building recently indicated the fire incident was an intentional act of arson. A wildfire disaster occurred on the Liberian Capitol Building on December 18, 2024, causing damage to the Legislature of $1.8 million. The fire incident was noticed by citizens early in the morning at about 6:00 am. A preliminary Police report referred to the incident as an act of arson. The Liberian National Police have also summoned a few lawmakers who are believed to be connected to the act . The Representatives are Prescilla Cooper, Marvin Cole, Dixon Seboe, Frank Saah Foko, Abu Kamara, and embattled Speaker Fonati Koffa. After the Liberian National Polices preliminary investigation, the Government of Liberia invited International Fire investigators to conduct further examinations. The Minnesota-based Fire Rescue Alliance (FRA) arrived in Liberia on Feb 28, 2025, and effectively started operating. On May 4, 2025, the FRA released the findings from the investigation. Based on this backdrop, Bryan Harris, a social media user, posted in Liberian Policy Forum, a Facebook group, alleging that the FRA findings revealed that the Capitol Building Disaster was caused by electric shock and natural causes. The post said, Capitol Building fire investigative report says the fire was caused by a natural incident and electrical shock. Screenshot below of the claim above By the time this report was put together, the post had accumulated 41 reactions and 216 comments. Commenters challenged the credibility of the claim, and others agreed with the posters allegation. The mixed reactions led DUBAWA to conduct a fact check. Screenshot of comments above DUBAWA researched the findings of the American Fire Investigators. The investigative report highlighted the following findings. According to FRA investigators, the area of origin of the fire was identified at or near the Speakers podium, where the most significant fire damage was identified. The report added that the finding is supported by burn pattern analysis and correlates with witness statements regarding the first windows breaking on the west side of the building, which introduced additional oxygen and intensified the fire. The investigation concludes that a fire originating near the Speakers podium would involve a lot of combustibles such as furniture, cloth bunting, foam chairs, carpet, and the like. FRA said the rapid spread of this fire suggests an ignitable liquid was used to allow such a fire to spread to full involvement within minutes. Above the Speakers podium was a vertical wall covered with wood panelling and the Liberian crest on its face. With the fire originating at or near the podium, the fire moved vertically up the wall and across the underneath side of the west wall balcony. It then moved vertically up the front of the wood-covered backdrop with the Liberia Crest and to the ceiling. The investigation ruled out an electrical cause, as an examination of electrical conductors in the area of the fire found no evidence of arcing or short-circuiting. Additionally, prior vandalism had resulted in cutting exterior electrical conductors, eliminating the possibility of an electrical ignition source. No evidence of energised appliances or active electrical loads was present at the time of the fire. Building maintenance stated the air conditioning units were not working, and if they were, they would not have been in use as they do not operate them unless the chamber is in use. Considering the lack of accidental ignition sources, the presence of ignitable materials in key areas, and fire behaviour consistent with an incendiary act (rapid fire growth), the cause of the fire has been classified as intentional (incendiary). Further findings revealed that within the area of origin and along primary egress routes, investigators located eight one-gallon containers, which were not observed in the building less than 24 hours prior during a legislative meeting. The placement of these containers, particularly near exits, suggests an intentional effort to obstruct egress and increase fire spread, which may have been the intent. Based on a systematic fire investigation following best practices, this fire has been classified as INCINDIARY in nature. The determination was reached through a methodical analysis of fire patterns, material damage, witness statements, and physical evidence processed and collected at the scene, the report said. The report was also published on several Liberian News platforms. A few of them can be found here and here. Based on DUBAWAs findings, the FRA report didnt link the Capitol Building fire to natural causes and electrical shock.",1
"Since Bola Tinubu, Nigerias president, addressed the nation in his January 2025 New Year speech, citizens have battled frightening inflation rates. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), goods inflation surged from 29.9% at the months end to a 30-year high of 34.6% . Amidst the economic crises, workers at federal government establishments are yet to begin earning the N70,000 minimum wage , despite its approval and implementation since July 2024, when it rose by 133% from the previous amount. However, Nigerians were yet to get accustomed to the fuel subsidy removal that the Tinubu-led administration implemented in 2023, which plunged many citizens into severe economic hardship. At the Presidential New Year address on Jan. 1, 2025, Mr Tinubu said the countrys economic outlook looks promising despite witnessing a nationwide 10-day-long protest against economic hardship and general dissatisfaction with his administration. He mentioned fuel price reduction, increased foreign trade and foreign reserves, and a more substantial value for the Naira against the dollar as metrics for overall economic stability analysis. He said, Economic indicators point to a positive and encouraging outlook for our nation. Fuel prices have gradually decreased, and we recorded foreign trade surpluses in three consecutive quarters. Foreign reserves have risen, and the Naira has strengthened against the US dollar, bringing greater stability. We identified four claims on Nigerias economic trajectory from the presidents speech for verification. Claim 1: Fuel prices have gradually decreased. Following fuel subsidy removal as part of Mr Tinubus inaugural economic reform announcement, prices surged thrice throughout 2024. Retail sellers priced petrol at around N617 per litre at the start of the year. By Sept. 3, 2024, the price increased by 45.38% to between N855 and N897 per litre , marking. This trend continued, with further hikes leading to prices reaching N1,030 per litre by October. Different factors contributed to the recent decrease in petrol prices from N1,060 to N1,040 per litre , as the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL) announced. The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) indicated that its members would reduce prices by N50 per litre when sourcing directly from Dangote Refinery, a relief for consumers facing rising living costs throughout the year. Verdict: MISLEADING! Claim 2: Nigeria recorded foreign trade surplus in three consecutive quarters In 2024s first quarter, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) revealed that Nigerias total merchandise trade reached an impressive N31.8 trillion. This is an increase of 46.27% from the previous quarter and an astonishing rise of 145.58% compared to the same period in 2023. Exports accounted for N19.167 trillion, a 51% increase from 2023 Q4s figures. Crude oil exports dominated this figure, amounting to N15.48 trillion and making up approximately 80.80% of total exports. The trade balance for this quarter stood at N6.52 trillion, indicating a healthy surplus driven by strong export performance. The total value of foreign trade in 2024 Q2 , at N31.9 trillion, was better than in Q2 2023 when trade was valued at N12.7 trillion. Increased oil and non-oil exports drove the trade surplus to N19.4 trillion during this period. Meanwhile, Nigerias dependence on imported fuel and other goods increased imports to N12.5 trillion. The growth trend continued into the third quarter, with total merchandise trade reaching N35.16 trillion , an 81.35% and 13.26% increase from Q3 2023 and Q2 2024, respectively. Exports also rose by 16.76% from the previous quarter and 98% year-on-year to N20.49 trillion, with crude oil exports contributing significantly to this growth. The import bill also increased to N14.67 trillion during this period. However, Nigeria maintained a trade surplus of N5.81 trillion. Verdict: TRUE Claim 3: Nigerias foreign reserve has risen According to the Central Bank of Nigeria, the nations foreign reserves stood at approximately $32.87 billion as of December 2023. By September 19, 2024, the reserves had risen to $39.07 billion , representing a significant year-on-year increase of about 17.4%. Several factors contributed to the growth, including increased crude oil production, improved remittance flows, and strategic reforms the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) implemented to attract foreign capital. By Dec. 30, 2024, Nigerias foreign reserves increased by 24.2% to $40.88 billion in one year . However, the naira recorded a 40.9% loss against the dollar in the official market. Verdict: TRUE Claim 4: Naira has strengthened against the US Dollar As of Dec. 31, 2024, the exchange rate was quoted at approximately N1,535 per dollar, a steep decline from N997 per dollar at the end of 2023, which represented a 40.9% loss in value over the year. The naira started the year at around N988.46 per dollar on January 2, 2024, and fell to N1,535 by year-end, indicating a consistent downward trend. The exchange rate data for 2024 revealed that the naira faced increasing pressure due to heightened demand for foreign currency to meet various needs, including imports and other expenses. The naira fluctuated significantly throughout the year, with the highest recorded rate being N1,685.62 in the official market ( N1,745 in the parallel market) on Nov. 27, 2024. Verdict: MISLEADING",1
"Claim : Mohbad is getting a haircut for his reburial. Verdict : Even though an autopsy has been conducted, Mohbads body is currently retained at the morgue under the supervision of the police. The family has not yet been permitted a second burial. Hence, the claim is false. Winnie Bryce , a Facebook user, posted a reaction video with the impression that Mohbad is being prepared for his second burial. In the 56-second clip, a man gives a haircut to a corpse in a blue casket. Although the head of the deceased male was visible, the video did not show his face. Ms Bryce captioned her post with Mohbad having his hair shaved. Famously known as Mohbad, Ilerioluwa Aloba , a Nigerian artiste, became a public discourse when his death was announced on Sept. 12, 2023. After his demise, controversies about the demand for justice persisted. This recent information has garnered over 17,000 likes and 891 shares on Facebook. Like others debunked by DUBAWA, this particular one has also generated confusion and heated arguments among other users. We, therefore, decided to conduct this verification to establish the truth. On Sept. 21, 2023, Mr Aloba, who had initially been buried, was exhumed by the Lagos State Police Command as part of a probe into the cause of his mysterious death. The same day, the Nigeria Police Force also confirmed the conclusion of an autopsy on the singers remains. Likewise, the public was promised further information as soon as results were available. As of Sept. 28, 2023, Nigerian Tribune reported how Mr Aloba received a free casket, hall, discount for vault, and other services as famous actresses Iyabo Ojo and Tonto Dikeh began preparations for his second burial. Ms Ojo, however, made it clear on her Instagram page that a date has not been fixed for the burial as the body is still with the police. She said: The body is still with them. There is no date yet fixed for his final burial. But finally, when they get to be done with the body, they will get to the family. The family will fix a date, and then we will announce it. Since the results of the autopsy conducted by the police are not yet out, the remains of Mr Aloba are still in law enforcement custody. Truly, Iyabo Ojo and other close associates of Mohbad have begun preparations for his reburial, but they have also made it clear that no date has been fixed. The video showcasing where a man is getting a haircut does not belong to the singer. The claim is false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed President Bola Tinubu blocked a deportation flight from the United States from landing in Nigeria. Verdict: The claim is false. While some countries have resisted accepting deportation flights, no credible news report or evidence confirms President Bola Tinubu blocked any such flights from landing due to impromptu scheduling. Following former U.S. President Donald Trumps executive order to deport undocumented immigrants, the first wave of deportations primarily targeted individuals with prior removal orders or criminal records. In early 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began conducting large-scale raids, leading to the deportation of hundreds of migrants, particularly from Latin America. Countries like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras saw a surge in returnees, prompting diplomatic tensions as some leaders pushed back against what they saw as abrupt and aggressive enforcement measures. A similar pattern has emerged under Trumps 2025 administration, with mass deportations resuming amid heightened immigration crackdowns. Colombia , for instance, experienced a mass deportation that led to a diplomatic dispute between the U.S. and Colombia when President Gustavo Petro initially rejected deportation flights. However, Petro later reversed his decision after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Colombian goods and threatened further sanctions. Drawing a parallel to this case, a Facebook account @Express shared a post claiming President Bola Tinubu has blocked a US deportation flight from landing. Tinubu blocks U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria over lack of timely notice Take them back, he declares. U.S. deportation plane stuck in the air for 23 hours, waiting for landing licence as Tinubu refuses approval, vows to deny entry, the post reads. The post, shared on Jan. 28, 2025, had 19 likes, four comments, and six shares as of Feb. 22, 2025. Similar claims have been shared here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . Although this claim was not widely viral, it emerged amid a trend of similar misinformation following Trumps executive order on undocumented immigrants. Given the sensitivity of deportation issues, DUBAWA checked. Using specific keywords from the claim, DUBAWA searched for possible reports or claims that affirmed what the Facebook account shared but found none. Instead, the search led to more links where the claim was similarly made. See here , here , and here . No credible news sources or official government statements supported the allegation that President Bola Tinubu blocked a U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria. Unlike the Colombian case, which received extensive international media coverage, no reputable outlets reported a similar incident involving Nigeria when the claim was made. Given the diplomatic significance of such an action, it would have been widely covered if true. However, subsequent reports confirmed that 85 Nigerians deported from the US arrived in Lagos on Feb. 17, 2025. These individuals were among the 3,690 Nigerians identified for deportation amid President Trumps 2025 crackdown on undocumented migrants. The Nigerian government has since expressed concerns about the process, rooting for a more structured approach. Despite these deportations, no evidence remains that President Tinubu blocked U.S. deportation flights. The claim that President Bola Tinubu blocked a U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria is false. No evidence supports this allegation, and no credible news reports confirm the event.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claims an explosion occurred in Rivers State amidst the ongoing Local Government elections. Verdict: True. Credible media outlets have reported that an explosion caused by dynamite explosives destroyed the All Progressives Congresss secretariat, located along Aba Road, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Rivers State witnessed elections in all its 23 Local Government Areas (LGA) on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2024. Amidst the Local Government (LG) elections, a Facebook user, Yoruba Aproko , claims an explosion occurred in the South-Southern State. Video: Hours Before LG Polls, Explosion Rocks APC Secretariat In Rivers State, the claimant wrote. Before the elections, there was a political rift between the Rivers State Independent Electoral Commission (RSIEC) and other political parties in the State over the release of the voter register. The claim, posted on Saturday, Oct. 5, 2025, has been played 87 times according to web data available and attracted one comment. To forestall any form of misinformation and disinformation during the local government elections in Rivers State, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on some of the video scenes; however, we found no material file related to the incident. We also did a keyword search related to any bomb blast that occurred in Rivers State amidst the local government elections and found news reports published by Punch, Vanguard, and Channels Television. According to the Punch newspaper, dynamite explosives were hurled at the All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat located along Aba Road, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. The incident, which occurred in the early hours of Saturday, Oct. 5, 2024, destroyed some parts of the building complex and some other properties. Vanguard newspaper quoted the states APC factional leader, Tony Okocha, as blaming the governor, Siminalayi Fubara, for the attack. He said, At the wee hours of Saturday, pro-Fubara civilian soldiers detonated dynamite at our office. The second attempt to set it ablaze was foiled as the security at the gate quickly put out the fire. Channels TV also reported a similar development. The claim an explosion occurred in Rivers State is true. Available news reports revealed dynamite explosives were hurled at the APC secretariat along Aba Road, Port Harcourt, on Saturday, Oct 5, 2024.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user asserts that 11 women are Managing Directors (MDs) or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of banks in Nigeria. Verdict: TRUE! Available information on the 11 Banks websites confirms they have female Managing Directors (MDs) or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). We also found various news articles from reputable media organisations on the appointment of these women. Nigerian women face great difficulty in achieving their political and leadership aspirations. Most obstacles they encounter are rooted in gender discrimination. Some areas where Nigerian women face the most significant obstacles are winning elections and assuming leadership roles. On average, women make up only 23% of high-potential pools at top-performing organisations. The numbers are even smaller in underperforming organisations, where only 14% of leaders in high-potential pools are women. Stephen Esabu wrote on Facebook that most of the banks in Nigeria have females as their bank Managing Directors (MDs) or Chief Executive Officers (CEOs). He stated this to show that females have taken over the banking sector. He mentioned the names of notable banks like Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), Union Bank, Access Bank, and Fidelity Bank. He concluded by advising parents to invest in female children as they do male children. This claim was shared on other social media platforms like WhatsApp and X . The post garnered 104,000 views, 1000 likes, 300 retweets, and 41 bookmarks since it was shared on March 23, 2024, on X. The virality of the post and the sensitivity of the post made DUBAWA verify the post. DUBAWA ran a keyword search and saw a news report by This Day Newspaper, with the headline As Nigerian Women Break Grounds in Banking. The report noted that 10 of the leading banks in the country are run by women as Access Bank recently named Bolaji Agbede as interim CEO of Access Corporation. Others are Yemisi Edun of First City Monument Bank, Miriam Olusanya of GT Bank, Halima Buba of SunTrust Bank, Ireti Samuel-Ogbu of Citibank Nigeria, Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe of Fidelity Bank, Tomi Somefun of Unity Bank, Kafilat Araoye of Lotus Bank, Bukola Smith of First Securities Discount House Limited(FSDH) Merchant Bank, Yetunde Oni of Union Bank. We also saw another report by The Cable highlighting and discussing the women in notable banks. They discussed the profile of 11 female chief executives of Banks in the country. We researched the 11 names mentioned and their respective banks to verify their position. Information found on the respective bank websites confirmed their position. According to the different Bank websites, Miriam Olusanya Is the MD of GT Bank , Bolaji Agbede is the interim CEO of Access Bank , Halima Buba is the MD/CEO of SunTrust Bank , Yemisi Edun is the MD of FCMB , Ireti Samuel-Ogbu is the MD of Citibank Nigeria , Nneka Onyeali-Ikpe is the MD/CEO of Fidelity Bank , Tomi Somefun, is the MD/CEO of Unity Bank , Kafilat Araoye, is the MD of Lotus Bank , Bukola Smith is the MD of (FSDH) Merchant Bank , Yetunde Oni, is the MD/CEO of Union Bank and Adaora Umeoji, is the MD/CEO of Zenith Bank . The Facebook post asserting that 11 women are leading the Banking sector is true. The various Bank websites confirm this. There are reports from reputable news platforms about womens representation in the banking sector.",1
"Nigerias first loan from the Paris Club a $13.1 million fund was taken from the Italian government in 1964 for the building of the Niger dam. The nations borrowing from foreign lenders continued but was deemed generally insignificant until the oil boom of 1971-1981 which brought about big borrowing. When oil prices crashed in 1982, Nigeria was unable to pay off the loans it borrowed. With the spike in interest payments and penalties, the debt became a financial crisis. This continued through the military regimes till the return to civilian rule in 1999 when President Olusegun Obasanjo embarked on the debt relief campaign. Nigerias debt, as of December 2004 stood at $36 billion which equals N 4.82 trillion using the official exchange rate of N134 to US$1.00 at the time. On June 29, 2005, the debt relief efforts yielded results when the Paris Club and Nigeria agreed on a US$18 billion debt relief package . Recently, a viral image showing Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had the claim that Mr Abubakar who was Vice President at the time, led the Economic Management Team (EMT) that paid off Nigerias debt. This campaign effort to show off Mr Abubakars achievement has sparked several debates for and against the claim. An Economic Management Team (EMT) is a team of experts that manage the resources, finance, income and expenditure of a country and advise the President on economic policy matters. Currently, Nigerias EMT is being chaired by the Vice President with the Minister of Finance, Minister of Budget and National Planning, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Information and Culture, Governor of the Central Bank, Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Director-General of the Budget Office, Director-General of the Debt Management Office, and Director-General of the National Bureau of Statistics as members. Was this the same situation during the period Mr Abubakar was Vice President? The Economic Management Team which appears as the Economic Management Council is listed as a Federal Executive body by the Nigerian constitution. This council is chaired by the Vice-President. In an article by Punch, Mr Abubakar said he assembled the economic team and in another article by the Guardian , he said he was the leader of the economic team. While the constitution recognises Mr Abubakar as the chair of the economic council, research shows that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who is currently the Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), led the EMT that cleared Nigerias Paris Club debt. According to her biography on the WTOs website, Mrs Okonjo-Iweala who served as Minister of Finance twice (from 2003-2006 and 2011-2015), spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club Creditors. As Minister of Finance in Nigeria, she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club of Creditors that led to the wiping out of $30 billion of Nigerias debt, including the outright cancellation of $18 billion, part of the biography reads. This report also noted Mrs Okonjo-Iweala led the economic team of President Olusegun Obasanjo. According to the Debt Management Office (DMO) document on Nigerias debt relief deal with the Paris Club, the relief was achieved through the collective efforts of the President, the Ministry of Finance, the National Assembly, the DMO, the EMT, and other stakeholders. To say the Vice President was the chairman or head of the Economic Team/Council is correct but to say he led the conversation that led to the debt removal could be misleading.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user asserts that the former governor Godswill Akpabio has stepped down for his opponent Emmanuel Enoidem. Verdict: FALSE. Our findings and Mr Akpabios campaign council disclaimer show the claim is false. A Facebook user claims the senatorial candidate of the All Progressive Party (APC) in Ikot Ekpene District, Godswill Akpabio, has stepped down for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Emmnuel Enoidem. This post was met with mixed reactions from both parties involved. While some congratulated the PDP candidate, others asked them to discredit the information. The Directorate of Media and Publicity for the campaign council of Akapbio shared a disclaimer when DUBAWA reached out to them. The statement indicates their candidate is still in the race and would not step down for anyone. They added that massive turnout for their candidates during the campaigns motivated them to continue the race and advised their supporters to ignore the insidious message. Our findings and a disclaimer by Mr Akpabios campaign council reveal the claim is false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook page posits that singer, Naira Marley and Sam Larry have been picked by The Department of State Services. Verdict: The video used to show he was arrested is an old video from 2019 when he was picked up by the EFCC. Also, no credible media outlet has confirmed the incident. Controversies and conspiracy theories have trailed the death of Aloba Ilerioluwa, popularly known as Mohbad. The late singer was signed to Marlian Music owned by popular musician and rapper Azeez Fashola known as Naira Marley . It has also been in the news that Mr Fashola treated the late singer unfairly with reports of bullying and harassment. Mohbad died on Tuesday, Sept 12, 2023, and was subsequently buried the following day in the Ikorodu area of Lagos. The Marlian Record label boss admitted that although they had disagreements, no harm whatsoever was wished on Mohbad. Amidst this controversy, DJ Splash, who fell out with Marlian Records, shared with Iyabo Ojo that Naira Marley did not approve of the late Nigerian singer, Mr Aloba, popularly known as Mohbad, because he wanted him(Mohbad) to follow in his footsteps, but the late singer had a different path. In a video , he revealed, Naira Marley didnt like Mohbad because he (Naira Marley) wants you to do what he is doing and Mohbad wont do it. Mohbad always includes me in his activities. Its just me and Mohbad who dont support Naira Marley. Following this revelation, Nigerians called for the arrest of Mr Fashola and his friend Sam Larry or for them to be invited in for questioning by the police. In another turn of events, a Facebook group, Tessys Gist posted a video showing uniformed force men leading Mr Fashola away. Ms Tessy in a voice-over said that the record label owner and Mr Larry were led away by the police because of the death of Mohbad. Her caption of the video read Breaking news, 30 minutes ago DSS finally singer naira Marley & Sam Larry arre$ted going kirkiri to face law over the d3ath of mohbad. The video was also posted by another blogger Voilet Razz Blog with a different caption Breaking Good News Naira Marley And His Chors Sam Larry Has Just Been rrsted In Kenya By The Kenyan Pol!ce Over Mohbads Dth The four-minute video has garnered 89,000 likes, 31 comments, and 2,200,000 views since it was posted on Sept 15, 2023. The sensitive nature of the post and the virality made us at DUBAWA investigate this claim. First, we did an advanced keyword search to see if the development was also reported by credible media outlets and saw that no media outlets confirmed the story. Then we used Invid, a tool for verifying videos to see if the video was used in another context and saw that Channels Television had reported in 2019, a video of Mr Fashola being arrested by The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). This means it is an old video recirculating again. We also saw that The Lagos State Police Command has inaugurated a 13-man special investigation team to probe the death of the singer. Do not forget, we have unique access with INTERPOL. Everybody linked to it (the death of Mohbad) will be identified and they will be brought to establish their level of involvement, Lagos State Commissioner, Idowu Owohunwa, said on Sept. 19, 2023, at a press conference. We visited the X account and Instagram page of the DSS to see if they had reported the incident and found nothing on their page. This also suggests that no arrest has been made yet. We reached out to the spokesperson of the DSS, Peter Afunaya through a phone call for a statement but got no response. Our investigation shows that the police have not arrested Naira Maley and Mr Larry. Investigations are ongoing, and no credible media outlet has reported the incident",1
"Claim: A user on Facebook shared a video of an acclaimed tug of war between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amid the ongoing war. The narrative in the video depicting a tug of war between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amidst the ongoing war is false. The soldiers in the video are not Russian and Ukrainians, but Canadian and United States soldiers back in 2012. One user on Facebook with the username, Topic News, shared a video of an acclaimed tug of war between Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine. The user accompanied the video with a short description that reads: One on one tug of war, Russia Vs Ukraine. The three minute-video depicted two soldiers with distinct military gear engrossed in a heated tug-of-war contest, surrounded by cheering spectators of other soldiers. Over 3 million users viewed the video, leaving behind over 62 thousand reactions and close to 3 thousand distinct comments. For most of these users who commented, this video was a heartwarming relief to see enemy soldiers having fun amidst the heated crises. Maryjane Fernandez, who commented on the post, said the tug of war between the two acclaimed Russian and Ukraine soldiers is better than killing each other. Alicia Ello even added that it is heartwarming to see unity promoted: Happy to see this fun time, they have each other so nice if their peace and unity will connect with each others heart, she wrote. Other users even congratulated the acclaimed Russian and Ukraine soldiers. As one user, Neru Baculi, wrote: Russian and Ukrainian soldiers. Nice seeing you as friends. God bless you. While the claim might be a heartwarming aspiration for peace lovers around the world, the Russian-Ukrainian crisis has given rise to multiple misleading information since its start. A good reason DUBAWA is attempting to uncover the veracity of this claim. DUBAWA first ran a frame-by-frame analysis of the acclaimed video on InVid video verifying tool. The results showed the video was first posted on 22nd March 2012 by a YouTube channel titled 31 Canadian Brigade with the caption: One on one soldier Tug of War, Canada vs USA. The actual video on YouTube offered a detailed description of what the video was about. It was a tug of war between Canadian soldiers and American soldiers. Prior to the departure of 31 Canadian Brigade Group (31 CBG) personnel from Camp Atterbury, Indiana, Canadian soldiers observed US National Guard soldiers playing an interesting version of the game Tug of War. 31 CBG soldiers were fascinated by the spectacle and cheered on the competitors. Finally, one young Canadian soldier dared to challenge the hometown crowd, and put national pride on the line. In this video, Master Corporal John Celestino of the Windsor Regiment (left), participates in a game of Tug of War with a US National Guard soldier (right). This version of the game builds esprit de corps and really works the leg muscles, the description of the video outlines. Even more, the two competing soldiers depicted in the video had the flags of the United States and Canada on their uniforms. The actual video was that of American and Canadian soldiers playing tug of war during a joint military exercise back in 2012, and not of Russian and Ukrainian soldiers amidst the ongoing war. As such, this claim is false.",0
"Claim: TVC news as well as other social media users had reported that the Adekunle Police Station in Yaba, Lagos had been set ablaze by angry #EndSars protesters. False, the claim by some individuals and TVC News about the Adekunle police station being set ablaze by protesters is misleading and a disinformation. On twitter, many users reported and shared news of the Adekunle police station being razed by protesters and the report gained more grounds when local television news station, TVC reported it. The Jonathanian (@The_Jonathaian) tweeted against the burning of the police station, asking whoever is responsible to Stop this now reminding people that the #EndSars is a non-violent peaceful protest to pressurize the government to #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria, Others like Shaba Baba Muhammad (@Spychief) simply tweeted to inform others saying, Adekunle Police Station in Yaba has been set on fire. By Peaceful Protesters But Usman Yusuf (@UsmanYusuf) tweeted with additional misinforming reports, BREAKING: Adekunle Police Station in Yaba, Lagos on fire after an attack by #EndSars Protesters following another attack on RRS members and building on Herbert Macaulay way with many others injured and vehicles vandalised @ValiantNig! TVC News was the most viral as its burning was reported on live national TV with the on screen headline, saying, Just in: Adekunle Police Station, Yaba on fire The hashtag #EndSARS campaign and protest kicked off again this year with a lot of Nigerian entertainers, activists, and influencers calling for the disbandment of the Federal Special Anti Robbery Squad unit of the Nigerian Police Force. SARS has been accused of extra-judicial killings and the most recent being, the shooting of 2 young men in Portharcourt and in Ughelli with the former reported to have died much earlier. Since the protest started, many unverified stories have filled the social media space on an hourly basis. At 13:00 on Monday, the 19th of October, gunshots from the Adekunle police station were heard by protesters and pedestrians causing a pandemonium in the Yaba area of Lagos. Not long after, reports of the Adekunle Police Station being burnt down followed almost immediately on social media with some Television and online news platforms confirming the report. Dubawa reached out to the PRO of the police command in Lagos State, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi who tagged the report untrue Adekunle police station in Lagos State was not set ablaze. Disregard the rumour please. For more clarification, dubawa visited the Adekunle Police Station to examine its true state. It was as quiet as a graveyard with very few people seen on the street, with Just cars driving to their destination and a handful of people at the police station itself. No signs of fire or smoke in the air, all blue skies. The claims by TVC News and other individuals on social media that the Adekunle police station at Yaba, Lagos was set ablaze by the #EndSARS protesters are completely false and should be regarded as disinformation. The researcher produced this fact check under the auspices of the Dubawa 2020 fellowship to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: An X user posted that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for refusing to sing the national anthem, for protests, and for insulting the president and politicians, or religious leaders, among others. Verdict: False! President Tinubu has not made any new laws or imposed fines against protesters or other issues. Rather, the House of Assembly speaker is set to read a bill on the same on the floor of the House. Over the years, Nigeria has grappled with complex issues surrounding freedom of speech and expression. Under military regimes , when freedom of speech was severely curtailed, laws like the Public Order Decree were enacted, which gave authorities broad powers to restrict public gatherings and expression deemed detrimental to national security. While the military regime is now history, recent years have seen a resurgence of debates around freedom of speech in Nigeria. The government has faced criticism for introducing or considering laws that some perceive as encroaching on fundamental human rights. Some notable examples include the Social Media Bill , the Anti-Fake News Bill , and the Hate Speech Bill, among others. These proposed laws have sparked intense debate among civil society groups, journalists, and human rights advocates, who fear they could undermine democratic principles and create a chilling effect on free expression in Nigeria. As these details continue to be debated in the public space, on August 13, 2024, an X user, @MickaelCbearnard, posted a tweet claiming that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for Nigerians who refused to sing the national anthem for protests, insulting the president and politicians or religious leaders among other penalties. The tweet reads: While we were dragging SA (South Africa), Tinubu began passing a new law. The bill prescribes 10 years in prison + 5 million fine for anyone who refuses to sing the national anthem. It also prescribes 5 years for anyone who protests. And finally, 2 years in prison for anyone who insults Tinubu. And its not just that. If you insult any politician, you get 2 years in prison. Ranging from councillor, LGA chairman, SSA to SA to governor or PA to a traditional ruler. If you insult a pastor or Imam, 2 years in prison. If you receive donations from the diaspora for protest or campaign against Tinubu, 20 years in prison. As of August 15, 2024, the post had been viewed over 950,000 times, generating over 6,300 likes, 7,400 retweets, and 850 comments on X. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed outrage and disbelief. An X user, @Amazirostanley , wrote: This is an abuse of the power of the office of the president. It will lead to more protests. He should arrest us all. Protest is a right. @mosdefdbest wrote: These people are lower beings than animals. Gradually, this man is turning the democracy we dont have into an autocracy. While expressing scepticism at the post, @Quests_Ans queried: Does he have that right? Having observed the various reactions and engagement generated by the post and its virality by other platform users, DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. The bill seeking fines and imprisonment for Nigerians who embarrass leaders, among other issues, was sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Abbas, not President Tinubu. Mr Tajudeens bill, introduced on 24 July 2024 and titled the Counter Subversive Bill, according to its explanatory memoranda, seeks to criminalise subversive activities by associations, organisations, militias, cults, bandits, and other proscribed groups in Nigeria. Further defending and taking ownership of the bill being tagged to the president, the speaker, in a statement by his media aide, Musa Krishi, said: It is currently at the introductory stage and has not yet been subjected to detailed legislative scrutiny. The statement further notes that it falls within Nigerias anti-terrorism framework. The Bill awaits the second reading, during which the general principles will be debated. However, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria clearly breaks down the power relations of the three arms of government, which are clearly defined to ensure the promotion of good governance. The provisions of section 5(1) of the 1999 Constitution are very apt in this regard. Our findings show that the claim that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for protesters who refuse to sing the national anthem and insult the president and politicians, among other issues, is false.

"If you believe a popular claim circulating on social media in January 2023, a 20-year-old Nigerian woman has become the first black girl to perform a human heart transplant within 30 minutes. This remarkable claim first appeared in a now-deleted 7 January tweet , which in just a week received almost 19,000 likes and some 1.2 million views. Other versions of the claim surfaced in the following days here , here , here , here , here and here . These posts claim that what led to the medical milestone was Nigerian presidential candidate Peter Obi sending the surgeon-to-be, Chimaka, to England on a scholarship. The posts also include four photos: one of Obi, one of a woman in medical scrubs , one of a group of surgeons around an operating table, and one of what looks like a human heart connected to tubes. Some users who came across the claim were unconvinced. In reply to the claim on social media, one user wrote : Please be calming down with them lies. Another simply asked : Source?? But did a Nigerian named Chimaka become the first black woman to perform a heart transplant, in under 30 minutes, thanks to Peter Obi? And do the photos reflect this? We checked. An internet search revealed that the photo of surgeons standing around an operating table is from a 2022 world-first surgery . But it involved transplanting a pig heart into a human, performed by a team in the US state of Maryland. Similarly, as AFP has reported , the photo of the heart was taken years ago, and appears on various websites, including here and here , as well as on the Wikipedia page for heart transplantation , where it is listed as created in 2019. A Twitter user quickly clarified the story behind the photo of the person wearing medical scrubs. Identifying herself as Wuraola, the user posted a link back to a 2020 tweet where she had posted pictures from the same photoshoot , and said they had all been taken years ago in medical school. The full photoshoot is available on a stock image website. Waruola confirmed to AFP that the photos had been taken in 2019 in Ukraine. She is Nigerian but living in the United States. On Twitter, she clarified that she had recently completed an undergraduate degree at a Ukrainian university, funded by her parents. Obi, who appears in the first photo in the post, is a politician and candidate in Nigeria's upcoming 2023 presidential election. As an AFP fact-check noted, Obi has in the past awarded scholarships to university students. But neither Africa Check nor other fact-checkers could find evidence of a scholarship given by Obi to someone called Chimaka who went on to become a surgeon. According to the UKs National Health Service and Mayo Clinic , a US-based medical centre, heart transplants are complex surgical procedures that take hours for teams of surgeons to perform, not just 30 minutes. Someone who recently obtained an undergraduate degree would not perform heart surgery. According to records from Encyclopaedia.com , Dr Velma Scantlebury was the first black woman surgeon in the US to perform a transplant. But Africa Check could not find reliable sources for who was the first black woman surgeon to perform a heart transplant worldwide.",0
"Claim: Donald Trump has officially banned gay marriage in all 50 states in America, a Facebook user claimed. Verdict: False. Even though Donald Trump has won the election, he has yet to be sworn in as president. Until he is sworn in on January 20, 2025, he has no power to make new laws or abrogate old ones. Also, the U.S. Supreme Courts Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, which legalised gay marriage in America, is still in force. A vast number of Americans support same-sex marriage, a survey recently conducted by a U.S.-based organisation shows. This comes almost a decade after the countrys Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that gay marriage is legal nationwide. But there have been reports of the president-elect, Donald Trump , being against the practice of same-sex marriage in the country. Just a few days after he won the U.S. 2024 presidential election, a Facebook page named United Africa posted that Trump has officially banned same-sex marriage in all 50 states in America. Any person caught in the act faces a jail term, the post said. The only genders recognised by the USA Government are male and female. The post attracted 1.1k reactions, 328 comments, and 145 shares as of the time of this report. DUBAWA checked the authenticity of the information published. The claim on United Africa was made on Nov. 19, 2024, a few days after Donald Trump was elected president. Even though he is president-elect, he has not been sworn in and, therefore, does not have the power under US jurisprudence to make new laws or abrogate old ones. He will be officially inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2025, but Joe Biden will remain the president of the United States until then. Also, DUBAWA read the U.S. Supreme Courts Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, which ruled that gay marriage is legal and permitted to be practised throughout America. The court, through a 5 to 4 vote ruling, said that states may not bar same-sex couples from marriage on the same terms as accorded to couples of the opposite sex. Since then, the courts decision has not been overturned. Also, in December 2022, President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act . This law will serve as a shore-up in America if the Supreme Court diminishes the constitutional rights to same-sex marriage in the future. Therefore, the United Africas post that Donald Trump has officially banned gay marriage in all 50 states in America is misleading.",0
"Claim: An X user, @Sebastineogb, shared a video claiming the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) discovered stacks of spoilt naira notes in a container in Abuja. Verdict: Misleading! The recirculated video was a 2022 clip showing condemned bank notes found in Wadata Police Barracks in Benue State. Nigerias economic situation has left many citizens frustrated. Harsh economic conditions, compounded by impulsive policies, have further worsened living standards. Many Nigerians turn to social media daily to express their dissatisfaction with the government. The Central Bank of Nigeria recently announced new ATM charges for both on-site and off-site withdrawals, which translates to higher cash withdrawal charges for Nigerians. Some Nigerians have condemned this move , set to begin on March 1, 2025, criticising the growing tax burden on the working population. Other concerned citizens also decried poor leadership in the country. Joining the conversation, an X user, @Sebastineogb, shared a video claiming the EFCC recently discovered a stash of naira notes in a container in Wadata, Abuja. He captioned the video as Breaking News:- EFCC Discovered money hidden in a container in Wadata, Abuja. This is why our politicians will never make heaven, just look at our money. The election of bad leaders has consequences. Some of his followers believed the video to be recent as they condemned the selfishness of African leaders who otherwise embezzle public funds rather than serve the people the money is intended for. The post was also shared on Facebook, as seen here , here and here . A keyframe analysis of the video showed that it had been online since 2022. Residents had discovered perceived sacks of naira notes close to Wadata Police Barracks in Benue State. The banknotes were said to have been hidden for years. However, at the time, a source from the anti-graft agency told PUNCH that the sack contained condemned notes from the Central Bank of Nigeria. He explained that the owner of the notes bought the condemned notes from EFCC, cut them into pieces, and squeezed them for another purpose. Similarly, the Benue police confirmed that they had invited the shops owner, Mr. Isah Suleiman, for questioning. Isah reportedly tendered a waste management licence issued to him by the CBN. The police explained that the wasted papers from the CBN were usually processed into mosquito repellents. The recirculated video was intended to mislead unsuspecting members of the public. The clip originated from 2022.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user alleged that Liberian President Joseph Boakai announced the arrival of 15 aeroplanes and 15 ships to ease transportation challenges in Liberia. Verdict: False! DUBAWAs checks have no evidence to support the claim that Mr Boakai has announced the arrival of 15 aeroplanes and 15 ships. Liberian roads are known for not being motorable, especially during the rainy season, which hampers the peoples movement in the country. Road rehabilitation has been a key priority of President Joseph Boakais government since he launched the Arrest Agenda to address transportation challenges in the West African country. During his inaugural address , President Boakai told Liberians: The poor stateof our roads has undermined development and reduced citizens quality of life. This is indeed a major contributor to rural neglect in the country. This is why we view the building of good roads as a critical intervention in infrastructure improvement for economic growth and national development. As part of a concerted effort to revamp the transport sector in Liberia, Minister of State without Portfolio Mamaka Bility said that about 285 pieces of earthmoving equipment are expected in Liberia shortly to construct and rehabilitate roads. Those earth-moving equipment will be divided across the 15 counties, each receiving 19 pieces. The government will also reactivate maintenance zones across the country. We are working, and our plan to ensure that no car will be stuck in the mud is gradually being rolled out, and we will increase our work and visibility, Madame Bility said. However, on June 24, 2024, The Daily News alleged on Facebook thatPresident Joseph Boakai had announced the arrival of 15 aeroplanes and ships in the country. The Rescue Government, led by President Joseph Boakai, has made a groundbreaking move to alleviate transportation challenges across Liberia. Today, President Boakai announced the arrival of 15 yellow aeroplanes and 15 yellow ships, a significant addition to easing the nations transportation stress, the platform wrote. Reacting to the claim, another Facebook user, Harris Bravo Korheina, wrote : Can we have pictorial evidence of the pronouncement by the President? For Monger Zarwea Gabriel , If and when the president of Liberia makes such pronouncement, it will be on the Executive Mansion website. DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim as part of its campaign against misinformation and disinformation in Liberia. DUBAWA first contacted The Daily News for evidence of the claim but to no avail. A further search on the Liberian presidents news portal, the Executive Mansion, revealed no publication about President Boakis announcement. We later conducted a Google Keyword search to discover whether any of the countrys prominent and reliable media outlets had published a news article about the presidents purported pronouncement about the arrival of the ships and aeroplanes. However, the search revealed no online data to support the allegation. However, DUBAWA could confirm only the arrival of some earth-moving machines, which Liberias Information Minister Jerolinmek Piah disclosed on June 27, 2024. Mr Piah reportedly said it is terrible that a country has existed for 177 years and still does not have good roads, while the surrounding countries that gained independence in the 1960s have better roads. Also, Madame Bility led various government officials to unveil the first batch of 285 earth-moving machines and dump trucks to the public. DUBAWA also contacted Deputy Information Minister for Press and Public Affairs Daniel Sando via WhatsApp, and the minister described the claim as Fake. Based on DUBAWAs findings, President Boakai did not announce the arrival ofaeroplanes and ships in Liberia as claimed. Through the Ministry of Information, the government has only confirmed the arrival of some earthmoving equipment to help with road rehabilitation. The researcher produced this fact-check under the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Prime FM 105.5 Liberia, to spread accurate and factual information.",1
"CLAIM: Using an image to corroborate his claim, an X user, @DEMAN004 , tweeted that armed thugs recently invaded polling units in Bayelsa, in which they hijacked election materials and threatened voters and INEC officials. FINDING: We analysed the picture with TinEye, a reverse image search engine tool, and discovered that the photo the claimant used to depict the violence is from 2019. VERDICT: Misleading SOURCES: TinEye",1
"Claim: A TikTok user stated that Bola Tinubu, in an APC meeting, told his supporters to snatch ballot boxes during elections, with an attached video. Verdict: FALSE. The video has no mention of ballot boxes or election day. The poster seems to have applied a preconceived meaning to the words of the presidential candidate to mislead the public. Nigerians are a few weeks away from electing the countrys next president. Therefore, candidates supporters have taken the centre stage in campaigns both online and offline. Intending to convince the general populace, supporters share information, gaffes, and activities on opposing candidates. As a result, a TikTok user Mr_Noble Godson (@nobleboss8), shared a supposed leaked video of Tinubu encouraging his supporters to snatch ballot boxes at the elections. The video was also found on Twitter posted by Honyfactory (@Honyfactory) , who also tagged the video as a leaked one. Reacting to the video, @cent3ric noted it is impossible to do that in the elections. He can only do that in Lagos, not Nigeria, him never see craze , he commented. Another Twitter user, O.G.B (@ogbonna_ugwuowo), credited the video as a reason the presidential candidate did not sign the peace accord. Now you see why he refused to sign a peace accord, he tweeted . As of the reporting time, the video has attracted over 4,000 views, 300 retweets, 70 comments, and 200 likes on Twitter, while it has over 900 views on TikTok. This video was also made to WhatsApp as users shared the screenshot on their WhatsApp status. Due to its virality and potential to contribute or lead to electoral violence, DUBAWA chose to fact-check the assertion. DUBAWA listened to the video and could not find the keywords ballot box in Tinubus speech. We also noticed that the video started halfway, meaning an extended version exists. Study the anthropology of it. Where are we? Political power is not going to be served in a restaurant. It is not served a la carte. It is what we are doing. Its being determined to do it at all costs. Fight for it! Grab it! Snatch it and run with it! Those were the words of the All Progressives Congress presidential candidate in the 48-second video. We also found a report by the Gazette in December 2022, pointing at the same video and claiming to be about Tinubus ballot-snatching encouragement. Power must be grabbed, snatched at all cost: Tinubu, the headline reads. According to the Gazette, Tinubu remained in the United Kingdom after attending a Chatham House engagement earlier that week. The man at the end of the video was the one recording the video, and we found his name Mustapha Abdullahi, Deputy Chairman of the British APC, via a Google Reverse Image search. In a report by NNN News Nigeria, he discussed Tinubus Chatham House. A keyword search on YouTube led to different duration of the same video shared by different platforms a month ago, from OmoEluBlogTV to Prime Reporters News, to DIVINEVIBESTV, among many others. We also found that the video was shared a week ago by NIGERIA POLITICS TCGM, noting that the Bishop of the Worldwide Anglican Church in Nigeria, Bishop Seun Adeoye, is calling on security agents to invite and interrogate the APC candidate over alleged comments. These longer versions of the video show Mr Tinubu comparing the democracy and economy of Nigeria to that of India. He noted India has the largest democracy in the world and the richest middle class in the world. they didnt do it. We wont attach everything to destiny; you grab it. We are struggling for it now. What? Power. Power, political, power, electricity. Electricity has been the most important discovery for humanity in the last 1000 years. Go and study anthropology. This was the earlier statement before the one captured in the TikTok video. This reveals his comments had nothing to do with ballot box snatching or election day. Our findings show that the video conversations did not mention ballot boxes on election day. Although the presidential candidate encouraged his supporters to snatch and grab power at all costs, it does not imply that he directed them to snatch ballot boxes on the day of the election. Hence, this claim is false.",0
"Claim: A WhatsApp message claims that a Nigerian court has ordered Mobile Telecommunication Network (MTN) to pay one Emmanuel Anenih N5.5 million for unlawfully deducting N50 from his airtime. The claim is True. In 2020, an FCT High Court ordered MTN to pay Emmanuel Anenih N5 million for disturbing his peace and N500,000 for legal expenses, making it a total sum of N5.5million A WhatsApp message has been circulated on a group chat and privately to individuals that a Nigerian, by the name Emmanuel Anenih, had won a suit against MTN for unlawful deduction of N50 from his airtime for unsolicited caller tunes he did not subscribe to. Armed with the information, some WhatsApp users are claiming that they would sue the telecommunication service provider to claim money in millions, as they also experience such. The WhatsApp message posted reads: So a Nigerian by name Emmanuel Anenih took MTN to Court for unlawfully deducting 50 naira from his airtime in the name of unsolicited caller tunes he never subscribed to? An Abuja High Court found MTN guilty and ordered it to pay Emmanuel 5,000,000 for disturbing his peace and another 500,000 for legal expenses. Where is my phone? Let me check how many messages they have sent, I will also sue MTN by Monday. A WhatsApp user reached out to Dubawa to fact check the claim. The WhatsApp user claimed the message had been posted on another WhatsApp group. A keyword search on Google showed reports referencing a court judgement delivered in February 2020 after Emmanuel Anenih dragged MTN to court in 2014 over unlawful deduction of N50. Further checks revealed a two-minute video of the story published by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). According to the NTA report, Emmanuel Anenih had in October 2014 dragged MTN to court for illegal deduction over unsolicited caller tunes. It stated that the court action came after various correspondences between the plaintiff and the service provider. It also stated that the court had established, in evidence, that MTN in one of its letters to the plaintiff admitted to the deductions as payment for the unsolicited caller tunes, but went ahead to send what it called N700 bonus to the plaintiff for his eight-year patronage after he had complained. According to the NTA report , the then Chief Judge of the FCT, Ishaq in his judgement, said the N700 bonus did not amount to a compensation for the breach of the plaintiffs quiet enjoyment. The judge then ordered MTN to pay N5 million as damages for disrupting the peace of the customer and an additional N500,000 as cost for the case. This fact check concluded that the claim that a Nigerian court ordered MTN to pay one Emmanuel Anenih the sum of N5.5million for unlawfully deducting N50 from his airtime is true.

"Argentines living near Buenos Aires woke up to a horrible stench from the Sarandi Stream on Feb. 7, 2025. Viral online videos also revealed that the stream had turned crimson red like blood. A 5-minute, 42-second video trending on WhatsApp showed different locations where their rivers had turned red. The locations include Iran, Jerusalem, Russia, Peru, India, Siberia, Lebanon, Canada, Israel, the United Kingdom, Jamaica, France, and China. The video also included claims about the Euphrates River drying up and water springing out of nowhere in the desert, where the Arabian nations now reside. This incident sparked widespread concern and speculation, with some claiming it was a sign of the end times. The video referenced biblical prophecies in the Book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 16:3-6 which describes a scenario where rivers and springs turn to blood as part of Gods wrath. This narrative has been interpreted as a harbinger of doom. The video has gone viral on different social media platforms. On Facebook, users have shared it here , here , here , here , and here , while on TikTok, bits of the video was found here , here and here . However, authorities in Argentina have taken a more grounded approach, attributing the colour change to suspected industrial pollution , possibly from textile dyes or chemicals like aniline, commonly used in dye production. Residents nearby also revealed that authorities had ignored their complaints since the 1990s, when the stream started exhibiting unusual colours with oily surfaces, such as grey, violet, blue, and green. The Ministry of the Environment has collected water samples for analysis to determine the exact cause of the discolouration to verify the possibility of industrial waste in the region as the root cause. Despite the apocalyptic interpretations, the reality points to a pressing environmental issue rather than a supernatural event. Though rarely witnessed throughout modern history, rivers turning red have generated different myths of apocalyptic proportions globally. For instance, the Daldykan River near Norilsk, Russia, turned a vivid crimson in 2016, prompting locals to associate the event with biblical imagery. However, investigations linked the discolouration to industrial pollution from a nearby metal plant. One of the worlds most polluted cities , Norilsk, has seen similar incidents due to ore runoff from smelting operations. A similar event occurred in 2012 and 2014 when a stretch of Chinas Yangtze River near Chongqing turned red. These events were attributed to supernatural causes. Scientists, however, pointed to industrial pollution and silt churned up by flooding as likely culprits. Experts ruled out biological phenomena like red algae blooms, which are typically marine-based and unlikely in fast-moving freshwater systems such as rivers. Despite existing facts, conspiracy theorists also attribute the pink-red seasonal colour of the Cusco River in Peru to a spiritual indication of the apocalyptic prophesies. However, this spectacle is scientifically attributed to the erosion of iron oxides and other minerals from nearby red mountains and valleys eroded into the river. This phenomenon frequently happens during the rainy season in the area. Viral claims about the Nile River also evoked biblical references to the plagues of Egypt. However, fact-checkers traced the viral images to Chiles Red Lagoon, where natural sediments and microalgae cause its intense colouration. In other cases, algae bloomscaused by nutrient-rich watershave been responsible for red hues in water bodies worldwide. Algae blooms, another common cause of crimson-red rivers, are a phenomenon in which algae rapidly multiply in aquatic systems, often resulting in a change in water colour. These blooms, not just the commonly associated green or blue-green hues, can manifest in various forms. Depending on the algae type, the hues could be red, yellow, or brown. While they can occur naturally, algae blooms are frequently caused by human activities , mainly by introducing excess nutrients into water bodies. The primary cause of these blooms is nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus accumulating in water, often originating from agricultural runoff and untreated sewage or industrial waste. High temperatures, often associated with global warming, can accelerate the decomposition of nutrients like nitrates and ammonia, making them more readily available for algae growth . This favourable temperature condition is crucial for rapidly multiplying certain algae species. Algae blooms are more likely to occur in slow-moving or stagnant water bodies, as fast-flowing streams and rivers do not allow algae to settle and multiply as quickly. The effects of algae blooms can be both beneficial and harmful. On the positive side, they can serve as a food source for higher trophic levels. However, they often lead to adverse outcomes , such as oxygen depletion and the production of toxins harmful to aquatic life and human health. While red algae blooms are less common in freshwater systems like rivers, certain algae can produce red pigments. However, they are more typically associated with marine environments, such as red tides caused by dinoflagellates. Rivers turning red like Argentinas Sarandi Stream, among others, are often a result of industrial pollution or harmless natural occurrences and are not mysterious, as the viral video claims.",1
"CLAIM: a Twitter user (@SDiaso) shared a picture claiming that an Assistant Commissioner of Police was arrested for kidnapping. The claim that an Assistant Commissioner of Police was arrested for kidnapping is FALSE, as the suspect in the picture was a fake Assistant Commissioner of Police who was arrested by the Nigeria Police in Akwa Ibom State for impersonation in January 2019. On March 12, 2021, a Twitter user, Soludo Diaso ( @SDiaso ) shared a post with a picture purported to be an Assistant Commissioner of Police arrested for kidnapping. It had the caption Assistant Commissioner of @Police NG arrested for kidnapping in Nigeria. As at Tuesday March 16, 2021, the Twitter post had generated 4,954 Retweets, 758 Quote Tweets and 6,520 Likes. To verify this photo, Dubawa initiated a Google reverse image search. Results from the search indicate that the picture had been on the internet since 2019. A report from the results identified the man in the picture as Kinglsey Udoyen, who was arrested by the police in Akwa Ibom State in January 2019, for impersonation. Mr. Udoyen was arrested by the police for defrauding members of the public by pretending to be an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Akwa Ibom State. He was paraded before journalists at the Akwa Ibom State Police Headquarters in Uyo, by the then Commissioner of Police, Musa Kimo. Mr. Kimo said Mr Udoyen, who resides at House 3, Stadium Road, Abak, was arrested on January 2, 2019, for using the fake police rank to threaten and defraud unsuspecting members of the public. A search in his house led to the recovery of one English pistol without magazine and ammunition, portraits of chief superintendent of police and assistant commissioner of police, three pairs of uniform, police belt, fake police ID card, and other documents, the police commissioner said. According to a press statement by Frank Mba, the Force Public Relations Officer, the suspect, Kingsley Udoyen, is a fake Police Officer and not a serving Assistant Commissioner of Police. The suspect is an impersonator who was posing as an Assistant Commissioner of Police to defraud and threaten unsuspecting members of the public before he ran out of luck and was subsequently arrested. He has since been arraigned in a competent court of law and he is currently undergoing criminal prosecution at the Magistrate Court, Abak, Akwa Ibom State, the police spokesperson said. The Twitter post with the picture claiming that a Nigerian Assistant Commissioner of Police had been arrested by the police for kidnapping is false and misleading. As findings have shown, the man in the picture is an impersonator who was arrested and not a police officer involved in kidnappings in Nigeria.

"Claim: An X user claimed that the Nigerian Senate president Godswill Akpabio said they would approve plans to buy a new presidential plane despite hungry Nigerians. Verdict: False! There is no evidence that Mr Akpabio said the Senate would approve plans to buy a new presidential plane. In recent years, Nigerians have battled significant hardships , including poverty, insecurity, and a struggling economy. Against this backdrop, some comments by Nigerias political elites have been met with outrage, with some accusing the government of being insensitive and out of touch with the daily realities of Nigerians. Most recently, in June 2024, a House of Representatives committee urged the federal government to purchase new aircraft for the president and vice president. It said it was in the countrys interest to procure two additional aircraft, considering unforeseen mishaps that may arise due to the operational requirements of the Presidential Air Fleet. Prominent Nigerians and groups have since knocked the move to procure a new aircraft for President Bola Tinubu and his deputy, Kashim Shettima, despite the downturn in the nations economy. As these proposals continue to be debated in the public space, on June 22, 2024, an X user, Franklin Ekechukwu, posted a tweet claiming that the Nigerian Senate president said they would approve plans to buy a private jet for the president. The tweet reads: We know Nigerians are hungry, but that will not stop us from approving a private jet for Mr. President. His life is more important now than ordinary citizens. We have to do that as fast as possible Godswill Akpabio. What an arrogant, voluminous statement! As of June 26, 2024, the post had been viewed over 713,000 times, generating over 4,900 likes, 3,800 retweets, and 2,900 comments on the social media platform X. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed outrage and disbelief. An X user, @addel_cares , wrote: If he truly said that, it shows that all Nigerians deserve this kind of leadership because such a man should not be occupying such an important position. While @mavisikpeme wrote, Knowing how he talks, he definitely said this and more. May God help us. Another user, @emrayiam , expressed disbelief and wrote: Until theres video evidence of him saying this, for now, Ill not accept this is truly coming from him. Having observed the various reactions and engagement generated by the post and its virality among other platform users, DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. DUBAWA contacted Mr Franklin via his X account to request evidence for the claim made in his X post, but no response was received as of this publication. We also conducted a Google search to discover if there is any report on Mr Akpabios alleged statement that the Senate plans to buy a new presidential plane. Still, no credible news media platforms reported it. Instead, we discovered that during an interview with the press on June 24, 2024, Mr Akpabio said the rumours were the work of detractors. I never said that. I was actually in Zanzibar, Tanzania. So this is the handiwork of propagandists and people who never see anything good in what we are doing. Just be rest assured, pray for the government, have patience, and be assured that the combination of Tinubu and Shettima will bring wealth and prosperity to all. Mr Akpabio said. Despite Nigerian economic hardship, no evidence corroborates Mr Akpabios claim that the Senate would approve plans to buy a new presidential plane. Hence, the claim is false.

"Claim: Lawmaker Ado Garba says the law expects an aspiring member of the House of Representatives to have N70 million in hard currency to fund their campaign. Verdict: False! The Electoral Act only explains the limitation to the amount a political candidate may spend during an election period. For a senatorial candidate, it is N100 million; for a House of Representative candidate, it isN70 million. The Act does not indicate that the money must be in hard currency. A member of the House of Representatives and Majority Leader representing Doguwa/Tudun Wada Federal Constituency of Kano State, Ado Garba, has said the law allows a lawmaker access to up to N70 million in physical currency for an election campaign. In a video clip shared on Twitter by onejoblessboy , Garba stated that he is permitted under the law to have access to N70 million in in hard copy to organise his election campaign as an aspiring candidate. The law has permitted me to have N70 million as logistics for my election funding. I need to have this N70 million in hard copy, he said. That is the position of the law. Garba added that the law has provided all we need to oversee our election process and explained that you need to pay your agents in the villages, where you do not have ATMs POS where absolutely you do not have this new naira. The 2022 Electoral Act, Section 88, Sub-section four, clearly provides that campaign expenses for a senatorial or house of representatives candidate should not exceed N100 million and N70 million respectively. The maximum amount of election expenses to be incurred by a candidate in respect of Senatorial and House of Representatives seat shall not exceed N100,000,000 and N70,000,000 respectively, the Act reads. However, the provision does not mention nor discuss the mode in which the capped capital for the election expenses can and should be wielded. DUBAWA interviewed a lawyer and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Afri Forecasts, Eluma Asogwua, who explained that the Act only stipulates the amount of money an aspirant may expend for their campaign. No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a Financial Institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding N5,000,000.00 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or N10, 000,000.00 or its equivalent, in the case of a body corporate, Asogwua added, referring to the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act . Another legal practitioner, a lawyer at Adelante Castle Attorneys, Elizabeth Achile, debunked the claim. Achile said that although the Electoral Act limits the amount that can be expended in an election, the money is not meant to be spent using cash at the polling unit. She clarified that electoral expenses means expenses incurred by a political party within the period from the date notice is given by the commission to conduct an election up to the polling day in respect of the particular election. The naira policy or cashless policy does not, in any way, affect this because it is not saying that [the person] should bring [N70 million] and share to people [rather] it is saying that this is the money you can spend, she added. Achile finally added that the law cautions the amount of money politicians can spend legitimately or even illegitimately because an audited statement of account will be sent to INEC after the elections to show how much has been spent. The claim is false as the electoral act only explains the limitation to the amount a political candidate may spend for an election. It does not suggest that the money should be in hard currency.",1
"Claim: The rise in inflation rate is a global challenge due to COVID-19 and is not peculiar to Nigeria. Verdict: MISLEADING . Report analysis provided by international media reveals that although inflation prevails in most countries worldwide, COVID-19 isnt the major cause. The television news outlet Arise News has reported that the previous administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has defended Nigerias inflation rate. He claims that it stems from the global effect of COVID-19, and its not peculiar to Nigeria alone. The presidential spokesperson of the previous administration, Garba Shehu, asserted in a statement titled, Re: Buhari Leaves Inflation at Highest in 17 Years. This stubbornly high inflation is a worldwide problem, and no nation is immune to it since the global economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, a portion of the statement reads. Before the official reaction, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) had on Saturday, April 15, 2023, released the April 2023 Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation report. The April 2023 report details a 22.22% inflation rate which indicates an increase of 0.18% compared with the March 2023 inflation rate of 22.04%. While reflecting on the inflation rate statistics of other countries and trying to dismiss the notion that Nigeria is the only country experiencing inflation increase, the former president mentioned countries experiencing the same such as France, United Kingdom (UK), Ghana, Turkey, and Pakistan. France, which enjoyed a stable average inflationary regime of 4.1 per cent from 1960 to 2022, is today reporting price increases of up to 1,080.36 per cent, Mr Shehu wrote. He also referenced Ukraine as having to battle scourging inflation due to the war it is currently facing. Due to how sensitive the matter is and the crucial period (transition period) that the nation is in, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. We decided to check the inflation backgrounds of the countries mentioned by the former presidential spokesperson and large economy countries and identify some of the major causes of their inflation. Trading Economics reports that the inflation headline in France rose to 5.7% in April 2023 from 5.7% in March 2023. According to the report, the acceleration of energy prices triggered the upward movement. The report also mentions that the country has remained above the European Central Banks target of 2%. Also, the harmonised CPI, which the European Central Bank critically uses as a criterion, ascended to 0.7% monthly and 6.9% annually. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in the United Kingdom (UK) , bread, cereals, and chocolate prices have increased the inflation rate to an all-time 45-year high in Britain. CPI in the country was at 10.1% in March and a decline from February at 10.4%, as detailed in the BBC UK publication . The report also says that although there was high demand for oil and gas after COVID-19 elapsed, the current war between Russia and Ukraine also meant less quantity was available from Russia . It also reduced grain availability, causing global food prices to skyrocket. In February, the CPI increase was further aggravated by a shortage of salad and vegetables in the UK, causing the country to witness a historical food inflation peak. In Ghana, the inflation rate fell for the fourth month to 41.2% in April 2023 from 45% in March 2023, according to Trading Economics. Significantly, the figure has achieved the lowest mark in six months due to relative stability in the Ghana cedis, influenced by the high expectations that a concluding deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) $3 billion bail-out will soon happen. Turkey also recorded a significant downward movement in inflation in a sixth consecutive month at 43.7% in April 2023 from 50.5% in March 2023, according to Trading Economics . Reuters reports that this is coming ahead of the general elections, with incumbent President Tayyip Erdogan predicted to trail his main opponent Kemal Kilicdaroglu as some polls reveal. The cost of living crisis has engulfed household savings under the regime of President Erdogan, who has ruled Turkey for 20 years. In Pakistan, inflation lingers by a one per cent increase at 36.4% in April 2023, from 35.4% in March, according to Trading Economics . It also relays that the inflation figure is the highest since December 1973 and attributes the unyielding increase to rising commodity and service costs. According to a media outlet, moneycontrol , the Finance Ministry said that inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels owing to market frictions caused by relative demand and supply gap of essential items, exchange rate depreciation and recent upward adjustment of petrol and diesel administered prices. Despite the ravaging war in Ukraine , the countrys annual inflation rate has lowered to 17.9% in April 2023 from 21.3% in March 2023, reaching a one-year low, according to Trading Economics . Intellinews writes that the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) believes that inflation will decline significantly to 14.6% later this year. It hinges on the banks monetary policy and the rapid recovery of Ukraines energy sector, according to the National Bank Governor, Andriy Pyshnyy. On a month-on-month basis, there was a significant decline of 0.2% in April from 1.5% in March. In large economy countries like the United States, monthly inflation slightly dropped to 4.9% in April 2023 from 5% in March 2023, accordin g to Statista. News outlet Consumer News Business Channel (CNBC) reports that the CPI rose to 0.4% in March 2023, attributed to price increases in shelter, gasoline, and used vehicles. However, these were somehow managed by declines in fuel prices, new vehicles, and food at home. According to Trading Economics , China also witnessed a fall in its annual inflation rate to 0.1% in April 2023 from 0.7 in March 2023. The report mentions that the figure is the lowest since its last deflation in February 2021 amid an uneven economic rebound after removing a zero-COVID policy. Trading Economics reports that food inflation dropped to a 13-month low (0.4% against 2.4% in March), attributed to a slowdown in pork prices and a dip in the cost of fresh vegetables. Core consumer prices (excluding volatile food and energy prices) rose to 0.7%, and the consumer price dropped to 0.1% monthly. TheCable reports that the analysis given by the NBS on the factors responsible for the increase in inflation in Nigeria are food and nonalcoholic beverages (11.4 per cent); housing, water, electricity, gas, and fuel (3.69 per cent). Other factors are Clothing and footwear (1.69 per cent), transport (1.43 per cent), furnishings, household equipment and maintenance (1.11 per cent). Education (0.87 per cent); health (0.66 per cent); miscellaneous goods and services (0.37 per cent); restaurants and hotels (0.27 per cent) are also among the category. Alcoholic beverage, tobacco and kola (0.24 per cent); recreation and culture (0.15 per cent) and communication (0.15 per cent) further has significant rise. Buharis claim is misleading. Although inflation prevails in most countries worldwide, factors such as food and energy prices, politics, currencies etc., rather than COVID-19, have influenced inflation rates in these countries. .",0

"Claim: The Minister of Health, Dr Louise Kpoto, in an appearance before the Plenary of the House of Representatives, claimed that Liberia has the lowest rate of HIV/AIDS among African Countries. Verdict: Misleading! Findings from UNAIDS reveal that Liberia has a relatively low HIV/AIDS rate of 0.9%, but it isnt the lowest among African Countries. Algeria and Egypt have 0.1% of HIV/AIDS rates. The Minister of Health, Dr Louise Kpoto, and Liberias Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Thomas Cooper, appeared before the Plenary of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, February 4, to discuss critical issues being experienced in the health sector. The two Health officials were invited to provide reasons for the increased rate of maternal death, the alleged charging of patients to pay certain fees before they can be catered for at public health facilities, and the reassignment of Medical Doctors to the position of County Health Officers. Rep. Isaac Bannie of District #1 Grand Bassa County backed the communication preferred by Rep. Thomas A. Goshua of District #5. Grand Bassa County. Rep. Goshua stressed the use of a single syringe by drug dealers that is causing a high increase in infectious diseases. The Representative made mention of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis as dangerous diseases that have spread amongst the young populace lately. In the Ministers response to their inquiries, she said, unlike hepatitis, Liberia has the lowest HIV/AIDS rate amongst other African Countries. Minister Kpoto, comparing Liberias HIV/AIDS status to Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and other African Countries, said Liberia has the lowest. In Liberia, the HIV rate is low among our African Countries. Its 1.5%, and sometimes it goes to 1.2% comparatively. In the Ivory Coast, comparatively, it is 2.9%. If you go to Nigeria, the percentage is higher than in Liberia, Dr Kpoto said. Upon her statement, lawmakers in session argued that she wasnt providing correct information for their questions. They requested that the hearing be adjourned and that she appear in the Committees room with documentation for her answers. The claim is found on the OKFM Facebook page . It can be found between 33:36 to 34:50 mins. The back and forth on the accuracy of the information led DUBAWA to initiate a fact-check. Verification DUBAWA researched various documents about countries and their HIV/AIDS statuses in Africa. During the process, findings show that Liberia is part of countries with HIV rates below 1%, but it isnt the lowest. Countries like Egypt and Algeria have 0.1% HIV/AIDS rate while Liberia has 0.9%. Statistics from UNAIDS and World Population Review indicate that Liberia stands at 0.9% while Algeria and Egypt stand at 0.1% on HIV/AIDS status. Compared to other countries in the region, Nigeria =1.4%, Guinea=1.4%, Sierra Leone =1.3%, Ghana=1.5%, Ivory Coast =2.2% A screenshot of World population review data on countries and HIV. Screenshot of UNAIDS HIV/AIDS rate in Liberia and countries with the lowest HIV rates. Conclusion From our findings, Liberia is one of the countries with a low HIV/AIDS rate in the region, but it isnt the lowest among African countries. Therefore, the claim is misleading.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claims the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed the first sample of the N5000 note, which features President Tinubus image. Verdict: False! No report indicates the CBN recently introduced N5000 notes. Moreover, an analysis of the note shows that it was AI-generated. On Friday, Feb. 7, 2025, a blog page, 9Njablog , shared a picture of a new N5000 currency denomination featuring President Bola Tinubu and claimed it was recently unveiled by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Alongside the image of the alleged new currency, the Facebook user wrote, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled the first sample of the N5000 note, which will soon be distributed to banks. The note features a portrait of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. According to the CBN Governor, this decision honours Tinubu for his commendable contributions during his presidency. he wrote further. The post has attracted 10 reactions and 10 comments and has been reposted 10 times as of Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Several users on Facebook shared the image with a similar narrative as seen here , here , here , and here . DUBAWAs decision to investigate the claim because of the economic and political implications of the claim for Nigerias territorial integrity. DUBAWA conducted an extensive keyword search to determine whether the CBN has recently unveiled a new currency in Nigeria but found no report to validate the assertion. Investigating further, DUBAWA checked the CBNs official website , but there was no report that it launched any new currency. Furthermore, DUBAWA combed through the CBNs X and Facebook pages but found no post or image corroborating the claimants assertion. So, we tried to find the origin of the image used by the claimant. We subjected the image to an AI detector tool, Hive Moderation, which showed that it contained 94.9 per cent AI material. Using another image verification tool, AI detects content.com ., which reveals that the image has a 61% AI influence. We checked his official X handle since President Tinubu is attached to the claim. Still, we found no post or information about him being featured in any naira note or CBN introducing a new currency. We also did not find any such development reported by credible media outlets. DUBAWA also contacted the bank via its social media handles (Facebook and X). While we received no response from Facebook, its X page was inaccessible. Our investigation reveals that the CBN did not introduce a new currency or initiate any discussion about creating a 5,000 naira note. Additionally, the image shared by the claimant is AI-generated.",0
"The cash crunch that drained Nigerias economy by N20 trillion , according to the Centre for Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), was the last straw for Omotoke* (not real name), who started to consider migrating abroad permanently. She said anywhere would work, so far as its no longer Nigeria because [she] was tired at that stage. As if Facebook read her mind, she said she started seeing sponsored ads about how she could travel to Canada and what to take note of. One of the ads said one could become a Canadian citizen by marriage and get an instant visa. She followed through with the ad and connected with one Facebook name she no longer remembered. Her eyes were already welling up at this stage. I coughed out about $1,750 (N1,298,500 or N742/$ parallel market on April 18, 2023) to this guy for the process. He didnt collect it at a go; it was in batches. We dragged it from January to April 18 when it finally dawned on me that I had become a cash cow for him. He blocked me afterwards. Our conversations were entirely on Facebook because he didnt want to give out his contact. Many Nigerians migrate or Japa a Yoruba term that means Escape- because of the countrys economic hardship and unfavourable state of living. Among the diverse options readily accessible, Canada is the most sought-after. According to the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), 5,755 Nigerians gained Permanent Resident status in 2023s first quarter alone, a 32.5% increase from the previous year at 4,345. About 15,595 Nigerians had moved to Canada in 2021. By the following year, the statistics rose by 41.9% to 22,130. In a 2020 survey carried out by the Africa Polling Institute (API) on 772 respondents who had migrated (120 or 15.5%) or are considering migrating to Canada (652 or 84.7%), 75% chose greener pasture as a core reason for their choice while 55% moved to provide a better future for their children. Indeed, Canada became a canaanland for young immigrants due to the governments Express Entry programme that started in 2015 to reduce the proportion of senior citizens in the North American country. The programme eased access for immigrants to become permanent residents, provided they were skilled enough to earn points for eligibility. According to Worldometer (a data aggregation website), Canada s median age is 40.6 as of Oct. 2023. In contrast, Nigeria s median age is 17.2. To manoeuvre the Facebook algorithm, DUBAWA specifically searched for Canadian visa applications. We found many, like here and here . Meanwhile, such sponsored ads contravene Metas advertising rules under Unacceptable Business Practices . An overview of the policy revealed that Advertisers cant run ads that promote products, services, schemes, or offers that use identified deceptive or misleading practices, including scams to take money from people or access personal information. We do this to protect people from being taken advantage of by advertisers. We read through the comments and found some users who informed the interested persons to send them in boxes on Facebook. Among them were the users named Sam Charles and Barbs Opez Awolowo. DUBAWA proceeded to send messages to the two identified users. Only Barbs Opez Awolowo replied at the time the report was filed. The conversation was relatively straightforward, as he informed DUBAWA that the form to begin the whole process would cost $500 (N575,000, N1150/$ as of Oct 19). He also revealed that an old woman who is interested in the marriage arrangement exists. Typical of fraudulent moves, he attempted to hurry his prey into making the hasty payment, with the assurance that there would be no need for any further payment, even though he had previously said the payment would open the path to the next stage, which is expected to come at a cost. After begging him to consider the economic situation, we negotiated over the estimate of $500 to N500,000, and he compromised. The discussion ended for the day. Barely 48 hours later, DUBAWA contacted him again to inform him that wed raised about $300 or N300,000 for the form. He revealed that the money should be sent to his manager with the account number 8066183676 on Opay mobile bank. When we checked for the bank details, his full name was Opeyemi Peter Babalola. The name agrees with his usernames on Facebook: Opez (Opeyemi) and Barbs (Babalola). Customers using Opay confirmed that their phone number is automatically converted to an account number after the first digit (0) is removed. This implies that his phone number is 08066183676 since his account number is derived from his phone number. We assured him that the balance of the money would be paid the following week. It was the last time we contacted him, though he sent reminders twice. The last, on November 2, was a thumbs-up emoji, like a man who resigned to fate. When DUBAWA looked up the phone number on Truecaller, which was used as an account number on Opay, the name Ope Ope appeared along with the email Opeople381@gmail.com . One notable aspect of this discovery is the consistent appearance of the name Ope in the registered phone number and the associated email address. Ope is generally a shortened form of the full name Opeyemi, which is the name associated with the account number, as mentioned earlier. As DUBAWA followed through with the process, we discovered common traits. The sponsored ads promise a hookup opportunity (a term denoting a physical sexual relationship) for unsuspecting victims. However, the ads do not have a direct means to reach out to interested persons. Instead, we were redirected to websites explaining how an immigrant can legitimately gain citizenship in Canada. Also, the ads are not always accessible, except they are retained as a saved post on Facebook. As a result, the copied link to the ad can only lead to the page itself if shared with external platforms. The ad cannot be accessed by merely clicking the link. Meanwhile, attempts to inbox the pages will be met with automated responses that will spam the conversations till the budding victim becomes frustrated and forfeits the conversation entirely. This leaves victims at bay, with no choice but to signify their interest in the ads comment section, a sea of victims from where the perpetrators fish out their prey. Is marriage of convenience legal? Irrespective of gender, a marriage of contract is struck with an opposing gender that has attained citizenship status in the country, with the sole aim of securing a visa as an immigrant. However, the process is illegal and punishable by Section 292 of the Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46) as it is described as marriage fraud. False representation, fraud, and knowingly concealing material circumstances are reasons the Canadian government also revoked citizenship status a lengthy process kickstarted by the IRCCs minister. An instance was in 2019 when the Canadian government stripped Yan Yang, a Chinese immigrant, of the citizenship status he had already attained since 2010 because he became a citizen through a bogus marriage with Lisa Marie Mills. Biola* finally took the proper route by applying for scholarships to fund her move. But she also fell victim to the long-standing scheme in 2021 because she thought it was the quickest means then. My academic qualification then was worth it, but I thought that the process would guarantee my safety faster compared to taking the permanent residency path, which I felt was a slow process. To date, my dad dare not know I fell victim because I dont know what can happen. Chinonso* was more daring, though. After he fell victim in 2021, he tried again. This time, a close friend helped him out by connecting him with an Indian lady who agreed to the contract. If not because my friend had already arranged for me, I wouldnt have probably taken the risk again. But the money I lost then threw me into huge debts. I had to leave town and forfeit my family mocking me since I lost money and my supposed quick fix. Olufemiloye Ajiboye (Olu of Canada), an immigration policy analyst, urged aspiring immigrants from Nigeria to make personal findings to avoid falling victim to fraudulent schemes. He revealed that citizenship by marriage is legal, but due process must be followed; otherwise, the involved parties will bear the consequences from the law they tried to manipulate. He said, One of the ways Canada fights against marriage fraud is through the strict policies and regulations they introduced. If your spouse or partner depends on you, you must sponsor your partner financially for three years after arrival before he/she becomes a citizen. He also revealed that some consequences provided by the Canadian constitution and administered by the IRCC include a 5-year visa ban and deportation from Canada. To avoid falling into such a scheme, he advised Nigerians to compare the information they obtain with available details on reputable social media platforms that discuss migration through appropriate means. Also, aspiring immigrants should only process their migration through licensed agents and read more about the countrys migration policies on the official website .

"Claim: The Managing Editor of the Inquirer Newspaper claimed that radio was the first before newspapers came about. Verdict: False. A BBC report shows the radio was invented in the 1800s, while other credible reports show the first newspaper was made in the 1600s. The Managing Editor of the Inquirer Newspaper, Christiana Jimmy, appeared as a guest on World Radio Day, on a famous early morning radio show, The OK Morning Rush on OK FM in Monrovia. When quizzed by the host , Madam Jimmy said, As to what extent do you think radio is impacting the world, she responded, Radio is impacting the world at a very significant speed. She added that radio was the first before newspaper came about. Her response which spanned from 1:41:40-1:41:52, attracted lots of responses from the online and offline audience of the show, given that she and the other guests are popular and influential voices within the Liberian media landscape. Ironically, in the interview, Madam Jimmy cautioned journalists and media practitioners to be careful of what they say on the radio because the medium has a wide reach. She also added that the caution is due to how journalists play an instrumental role in information dissemination. Based on the comments made by Madam Jimmy, DUBAWA decided to set the records straight on the history of mass communication to discover which of the inventions came first, the radio or newspapers. The history of mass communication is a common subject of interest to many journalists, fact-checkers, and mass communicators. Several authorities have written for decades about how the various mass communication technologies have evolved and how each has impacted the generation, as seen here , here and here . Hearing Christiana Jimmy say the radio came before the newspaper was curious. DUBAWA contacted Madame Winnie Jimmy, also the Vice President of the Female Journalists Association of Liberia (FeJAL),) to ask for the source of her claim. She referenced UKEasys July 26, 2021 work Radio as a Medium of Mass Communication, from which she sent screenshots of portions of the work via a messenger chat exchange, among which she specifically highlighted a part that reads: Radio was the first truly mass medium of communication, reaching millions. The UKEssays work Madam Jimmy referenced states a disclaimer: Any opinions, findings, conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of UKEssays.com. It is common knowledge that mass communication started with the introduction of the printing press , giving birth to newspapers. Johannes Gutenberg , credited with the printing press and newspapers, served several thousand readers even before radio as a medium of mass communication. Again, Sutori, a popular US-based website, shows that the first newspaper was made in the 1600s. Before the invention of the newspaper, the site furthered the handwritten news sheets circulated widely in Vincennes as early as 1556. Whereas newspapers emerged in the 1600s, the radio was invented in 1800. A report from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) showed that in the early 1860s, the Scottish physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, derived four equations that together describe the behaviour of electricity and magnetism. They predicted the existence of a previously unknown phenomenon: electromagnetic waves. These waves were first observed in the early 1880s, and over the next two decades, a succession of scientists and engineers built increasingly elaborate devices to produce and detect them. Eventually, this gave birth to a new technology: radio. The report further noted that the Italian Guglielmo Marconi is commonly described as the father of radio. According to the National Inventors Hall of Fame , Guglielmo Marconi invented the radio in 1895 and transmitted electrical signals through the air. The experiences were, in effect, the dawn of practical radio. Checks from the BBC and other sources show that the newspaper was invented in the 1600s. In comparison, the radio came about in the 1800s, and the claim from the Inquirer Newspaper Managing Editor that radio was the first before newspaper came about is untrue. The researcher produced this explainer per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claims the federal governments student loan programme did not include tertiary schools in Nigerias Southeast region. Verdict: False. The alleged exclusion of Southeastern tertiary schools is untrue, as DUBAWAs investigation revealed that students from the region were among the schemes beneficiaries. As part of efforts to improve education in Nigeria, President Bola Tinubu passed a bill in May 2023 that allows the provision of loans to students in public tertiary institutions. Earlier this year, the government began granting students access to student loans through the Nigerian Education Loan Fund (NELFUND). On Oct. 1, 2024, a Facebook user, Prince Emmanuel , alleged that students from the Southeastern region were excluded from the ongoing student loans programme. As of Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024, the post has garnered over five comments, 15 likes, and 34 likes. DUBAWA visited the posts comment section and found that some loan applicants believed the narrative to be genuine. A Facebook user, Chris Chukwudi, wrote, Everything that has a beginning has an end. Condemning the issue, Amaka Goodness, another user, commented: It will end one day. We are coming, said Sunday Aunkam. Having noticed the potential conflict such a claim might lead to, DUBAWA decided to verify its authenticity. DUBAWA checked NELFUNDs official X and found a post informing about the disbursement of student loans to an additional 40 tertiary institutions, bringing the total to 59 schools. We carefully reviewed the list and observed that schools from the South East, such as the Federal Polytechnic Nekede, Imo State, Delta State University Abraka, Delta State, Ebonyi State University, Ebonyi State, and the Federal University of Technology Ikot-Abasi, Akwa Ibom State, are included in it. Further, credible news outlets like Leadership and Guardian reported how NELFUND extended the programme to 40 tertiary institutions, including schools in the Southeastern region. Finally, we contacted Zainab Adewale , an education reporter with Premium Times , who described the claim as unfounded. On their website, they stated that the student loan programme is designed to be accessible to all eligible Nigerian students, regardless of location, she told DUBAWA. We also checked NELFUNDs website and found the statement referenced by Ms Adewale. It reads: The Student Loan Initiative is in perfect alignment with the governments vision for education to be accessible to all Nigerians. This claim is false as DUBAWA found Southeastern states listed as beneficiaries of the NELFUND.",0
"The claims DUBAWA encountered last week cut across health, security and politics. Below is a summary of some of them: Herbal Magic, a Facebook page, recently claimed that pineapple leaf could cure stomach ulcers, cough and waist pain. The handler asked users to make a concoction by adding ginger and water. He then instructed them to take it twice daily. Our findings, however, showed that even though studies show that pineapple leaf has inflammation remedy properties, there is no evidence that it heals waist pain. For ulcers, available studies reveal that pineapple juice predisposes people to gastric ulcers because of its acidic nature. Read more here . For a country where violence has remained a source of concern, it was disturbing when former opposition lawmaker Acarous Moses claimed on Facebook that Liberia President Joseph Boakai has issued Executive Order #141, urging civilians to purchase guns and register them within 12 months. We, however, found this claim to be misleading. The Executive Order did not instruct civilians to buy weapons. Instead, it encouraged those already in possession of illicit firearms to register them within 12 months. According to the Presidents directive, the exercise aims to trace individuals with illegal weapons and reduce criminal activity in the country. Read about it here . Like many African countries, waste management is a challenge in Liberia. On Feb. 14, 2025, a blog named SPY Liberia claimed that Monrovia, the capital of Liberia is the dirtiest city in the world. We found this claim to be false. On the contrary, our findings showed that New Delhi is the worlds dirtiest city. Not only that, Monrovia is not among the top dirtiest cities in the world. Read more about this fact-check here . Death hoaxes have become a common misinformation and disinformation tactic being deployed by several social media users. Just recently, Facebook users claimed that Zanzan Karwo, a former head of the National Traditional Council of Chiefs and Elders of Liberia, is dead. In no time, the news went viral. However, DUBAWA contacted Chief Karwos family, who debunked the news as false. Read what the family said here .",1
"Claim: A post made by Dr. Damian Avar ( @therealsabidoctor ) claimed that persons experiencing burning sensation, fever after sex may be allergic to semen. The claim is partially true. Although rare, it is possible to be allergic to semen, specifically to the proteins found in sperm. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect ones everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Recently, a post made by QEDaily claimed that persons experiencing burning sensations, fever after sex may be allergic to semen. The post attributed the claim to a medical doctor and sex consultant, Dr. Damian Avar, also known as Sabi Doctor who said men who develop a fever or feel a bit sick after releasing their semen could also be experiencing semen allergy. The Instagram post as of November 8, 2021, has 34, 957 views. An allergy is an immune system response to a foreign substance thats not typically harmful to a persons body. A substance that causes an allergic reaction is called an allergen. Many allergens are everyday substances that are harmless to most people. Moreover, anything can be an allergen if the immune system has a specific type of adverse reaction to it. Allergy comes with different symptoms that are not new to the body system. Some of the allergic reactions come with inflammation and irritation. And the signs and symptoms depend on the type of allergen that unleashes the attack. It might occur in the gut, skin, sinuses, airways, eyes, and nasal passages. The immune system is part of the body and is composed of cells and their chemicals that work together to keep the body free of injurious agents such as infections. The immune response is not because of the noxious nature of the allergen but because of a misdirected recognition of the substance as harmful. Any substance which is recognized by the immune system is an antigen. In the case of people with allergies, the allergens are picked up by certain cells, called antigen-presenting cells that process them and allow them to be recognized by and to alert the innate immune system to their presence. In addition to other symptoms, dust and pollen allergy could come with blocked nose, itchy eyes and nose, runny nose, swollen and watery eyes, cough and others. Skin reactions include flaking, itching, peeling of skin and rashes, among others, while food allergy is characterised by vomiting, swollen tongue, tingling in the mouth, swelling of the lips, face, and throat, stomach cramps, shortness of breath and rectal bleeding, among others. There is also insect sting, which could also come with wheezing, swelling at the site of the sting, drop in blood pressure, itchy skin, shortness of breath, restlessness, hives, a red and very itchy rash that spreads across the body, dizziness, cough, chest tightness, anxiety and possible anaphylaxis, which usually is the last stage of conditions of allergy. A semen allergy, otherwise known as human seminal plasma hypersensitivity (HSP), is an allergic reaction to the proteins found in most mens sperm. It is said to be a rare allergic reaction to proteins found in a mans semen and it mostly affects women. Studies show that it is possible to be allergic to your own semen. And when this happens, it is known as a post-orgasmic illness syndrome. A reproductive health expert, Dr. Ademola Ayodele, said it is possible to be allergic to semen as parts of the body in contact with the semen will begin to react unfavourably. It is possible to be allergic to semen, but where that burning sensation is might be different from what a layman thinks, the burning sensation will be in the private part; that is where the semen has touched. However, the fact that a woman reacts to semen does not mean she is allergic to all semen, there could just be antibodies raised in a particular individuals semen, and that is why sometimes a woman finds it difficult to get pregnant for a particular person but when she exchanges partner, it is discovered that she is able to get pregnant, he said. He added that although possible, cases of a woman being allergic to semen are very rare. Such cases are very rare and the word allergy is very serious because it simply means that if not treated, it would keep disturbing the woman and she may die from it. The Chief Medical Director of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital UNIMEDTH, Dr. Adesina Akintan, said the claim that experiencing a burning sensation or fever after sex could be a sign of being allergic to semen is false. Being allergic to semen after sex is not true, there is nothing like that; it is not true. If the woman develops some symptoms after sex, it might be due to other factors and not because she is allergic to semen, he added. A gynecologist, Dr. Joel Sola Akande, said there is a distant possibility that the claim is true. He added, If the victim was infected before sex, then it has nothing to do with semen, but semen generally speaking does not cause allergy except in rare cases and under certain circumstances. It is a distant possibility for people to be allergic to semen. According to a study by the International society for sexual medicine (ISSM), sperm allergy is a rare allergic reaction whose symptoms include, redness, swelling, pain, itching, and a burning sensation in the vaginal areas. The symptoms usually start about 10-30 minutes after contact with semen. Although the symptoms may not be confined to the vaginal area, they can occur in any area that has contact with semen, including the skin and mouth. The study further added that for some women, the symptoms are localized; meaning they stay in one major area, and for others, the symptoms can affect their whole body. They may have hives, swelling, trouble breathing, or anaphylaxis- a life-threatening allergic reaction. Another report reveals that systematic reactions are experienced as dyspnea, dysphagia, rhinoconjunctivitis complaints, generalized urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal symptoms, exacerbation of existing atopic eczema, or anaphylactic shock. The report added that it has been reported that semen allergy may present vulvar vestibulitis syndrome or burning semen syndrome. These symptoms may occur during the first sexual intercourse. And some results are indicative of allergens originating from the prostate, prostate-specific antigen being clinically relevant. Although rare, it is possible to be allergic to semen, specifically to the proteins found in sperm. And although the symptoms may not be confined to the vaginal area, they can occur in any area that has contact with semen, including the skin and mouth.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims that former Manchester United player Paul Pogba has signed a two-year deal with the former club. Verdict: False. No credible news outlet has reported such a signing. Moreover, neither Manchester United nor the French international has approached the other for a third spell at the English club. French international and former Juventus and Manchester United star Paul Pogba is now a free agent after exhausting his 18-month doping ban in March 2025. The midfielder had initially received a four-year ban on doping allegations, but his sentence was reduced after a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS). However, the judicial proclamation also meant he would forfeit playing time, thus being without a contract with any club. Amidst his recent return, a Facebook user, FIFA 2022 WORLD CUP QATAR updates , claims that the 32-year-old has signed a two-year contract with his former club and Premier League side, Manchester United. BREAKING NEWS: !! Manchester United took me as their own when others rejected me. Its a great privilege given to me by Ruben Amorim to be here again, Paul Pogbas official message to fans after pending down two-year contract with Man United today As of Friday, March 21, 2026, the claim has earned 8,000 likes, 554 comments, and 52 shares. DUBAWA viewed the reactions of other Facebook users and noticed that some pointed out that there is no official statement about the new development. At the same time, some outrightly tagged it as fake. Any statement that is not official is a false one, Modoulamin Jatta commented. Though not confirmed yet, but not entirely fake, Opakunle Olukunle wrote. Fake news, and we dont need this guy, Tom Sibanda Dawuza dismissed. After comments questioning the posts authenticity, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on Google concerning the midfielders alleged contract status with Manchester United and noticed that no credible news outlet (local or international) reported the development. Manchester Evening News wrote on March 16, 2025, that the French international is on the lookout for a new club and has been linked to several clubs, including a third spell at United, but nothing official has been confirmed yet. Transfer Market indicates that the midfielder has been without a club since Dec. 1, 2024, the same time he terminated his former contract with Serie A side Juventus. Earlier in February, Yahoo! Sports reported that former player Louis Saha had urged Manchester United to sign Pogba, not just because the Premier League giants were afflicted with injuries but also because of how formidable the midfielder is. I would take Paul Pogba back at Manchester United in a heartbeat. Its not only because of the squad that we have now with injuries and all that but also because of all the elements he brings as a player, Saha said. Treble winner Dwight Yorke had also told Manchester United to sign Pogba, stating expressly he would give Pogba a third chance with merit to his fantastic playing style. However, TeamTalk reported that the English side had not moved to sign the French international and their once-beloved player. Moreover, Manchester United has not reported the recent signing of the 32-year-old into the English club. The claim is false. No reports from credible media outlets corroborate the Facebook users claim.",0
"Claim: A picture appeared recently on both WhatsApp and Facebook claiming that American Doctors Association gave out a warning that eating food in plastic causes 52 types of cancer. There is insufficient evidence to substantiate this claim, even though some researchers believe that plastic, especially when heated, may be injurious to human health. Recently, a picture went viral on social media, including on WhatsApp and Facebook, containing claims that eating hot food, drinking tea in plastic cups, and microwaving foodstuff in plastic bags will cause cancer. The image on social media contained a message attributing a claim to the American Doctors Association and linked plastic to 52 types of cancer. It also contained warnings and advised the message be shared to others. Alongside warnings, the message had a list of a few of the causes of cancer by the American Doctors Association. In the first instance, a search by the researcher shows that the image is not a new one, it has merely been re-circulated recently repeatedly. It appeared on Nairaland in 2016, and many other places including Facebook. This researcher combed the internet to confirm whether the image, and its content truly emanated from the source to which it was attributed, the American Doctors association. The Association of American Doctors has a dormant Facebook account. According to information on its Facebook account, it was created on 29 March 2015, it has 581 followers, but its last activity (a self-generated content) is a profile picture posted on December 22, 2016. The search on Google did not yield any organization by the name, giving the hint that it does not exist. Rather, what is available includes Association of American Physicians and Surgeons , and American Medical Association, but no American Doctors Association. In other words, the source or authority to which the cancer claim was attributed is non-existent, and therefore fake. Various studies say there is no single cause of cancer. Many scientists or groups, like Stanford HealthCare , maintain that it is the interaction or aggregation of many factors that produces cancer. In some broad forms, they say that the factors may include genetic, environmental, or constitutional characteristics of the individual. But they list some of the cancer risk factors to include, lifestyle (such as smoking, high-fat diet, working with toxic chemicals); family history (inheritance, genetics); some genetic disorders, exposure to certain viruses and environmental stimuli. They believe also that some forms of exposure to chemotherapy and radiation can predispose to cancer. In 2019, the Cancer Research Institute stated that a number of behavioral factors can lead to genetic mutations and, as a result, lead to the development of cancer. Such behavioral factors include, tobacco, tanning (excessive exposure to ultraviolet light), diet (red and processed meats), alcohol, unsafe sex (leading to viral infection) and inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis or obesity. In addition, the substances referred to as carcinogens have been reported to be implicated in cancer. They include chemical carcinogen exposure, hormonal drugs, immune-suppressing drugs taken by transplant recipients, and radioactive materials. Some studies have found that certain chemicals are released from plastic into our food and beverages, and have been linked to some metabolic disorders including obesity and reduced fertility. When heat is involved, the release of the chemicals can be faster especially when using the microwave, but other experts insist no sufficient research has been carried out to make this claim evident; so far theres no research that answers how much amount actually gets into our body. However, some studies strongly believe that at certain exposure levels, some of the chemicals in plastic beverage containers, some disposable plates, and toiletry bottles, such as bisphenol A (BPA) may cause cancer in people. BPA is a weak synthetic estrogen found in many rigid plastic products, food and formula can linings, dental sealants, and on the shiny side of paper cashier receipts (to stabilize the ink). They insist, however, that if you must use plastic, they must be plastic with recycling symbol 2, 4, and 5 which with recycling symbol 7 are safe, as long as they also have a leaf symbol on them. Researchers conclude that even though some studies have found certain chemicals in plastics can end up in things we eat and drink, the levels are low and within considerable range safe for humans. They insist that there is no good evidence that people can get cancer from using plastics. So, doing things like drinking from plastic bottles or using plastic containers and food bags wont increase your risk of cancer, they insist. No controlled study has been done to show that plastic can cause cancer. But some observational studies have found that it does have harmful chemicals . According to Cancer Research UK , even if a little quantity of chemical enters the food, their probability of being dangerous is very low. And, of a truth, that using plastic in microwaving food causes cancer has basically been enlisted as a rumor circulating about the disease. It is almost a consensus that no research has been able to establish that plastic causes cancer. In fact, this is the submission of Dr Jimoh Mutiu a clinical oncologist, at the University College Hospital, Ibadan , who told this researcher that there is no scientific basis in any part of the world to show that eating food in plastic causes cancer. He said, We work with evidence. The only thing that has been proven is processed food or smoked food that are carcinogens. Even in smoked food, we always advise cancer patients to eat smoked food in moderation. Smoking has been proven to be a risk factor for the majority of cancer, same as alcohol. [But] there is no scientific proof to support eating in plastic. While responding to claims that making moin moin (Nigerian steamed bean pudding) in nylon could cause cancer, he stated that this is also within the realm of speculation. For him , all these things need to be based on evidence. People can just assume anything. If there is no scientific background, science will not agree with it. He concluded that even if any study is carried out, the average result of the study will still be insufficient to generalise that it is universal. While there is evidence that plastic contains a measure of chemicals that scientists say are injurious to human health when used in packaging or processing food and drinks, there is a strong belief that plastic cannot be sufficiently and exclusively linked to cancer. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate this claim that eating hot food, drinking tea in plastic cups, and microwaving food in plastic bags will cause cancer.

"Claim: Bloggers claim that Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State was captured in a viral video berating his commissioner for works, Ifeanyi Okoma, during a recent road inspection. Verdict: MISLEADING. The man being addressed in the video is Paschal Aniegbuna, the state chairman of Ogbaru LGA. On March 10, 2024, a video surfaced on social media platforms, purportedly showing Governor Chukwuma Soludo of Anambra State addressing a government official during a site inspection of a road project. The video, shared by Lindaikejisblog on Instagram and Instablog9ja on Facebook, gained significant traction. The videos caption suggested that Governor Soludo of Anambra State publicly scolded the states Commissioner for Works, Ifeanyi Okoma, for negligence in overseeing the road project, specifically the absence of a walkway along the road. The inspection reportedly took place on Relief Market-Obodo-Ukwu Road in Okpoko, Ogbaru Local Government Area of the state. The caption reads, Youre incomptent, Anambra Gov. Soludo bl@sts his commissioner of works, Ifeanyi Okoma, during a recent road inspection. As of March 13, 2024, Lindaikejisblogs post had accumulated over 7,000 likes, 288 shares, and 1,355 comments, while Instablog9jas Facebook post got over 19,000 views, 500 likes, about 190 comments, and over 30 shares. Also, the video and the claim have been widely shared on various social media platforms by different users, contributing to the dissemination of the purported incident. Meanwhile, the posts comment sections reactions suggest mistaken identity, leading to misinformation and misunderstandings. While many people believed it was the commissioner in the video, a few argued he was not the one being addressed therein. Reacting to Lindaikejis post, C.C. commented: Linda, this your copy and paste no make sense o! That is not the Commissioner for Works. The Commissioner is not even in the picture. Thats the contractor heading the project Still under the same post, an anonymous follower believed it to be the commissioner as they wrote: Looking at the shape of Mr Okomas head, one can tell that he is incompetent. On Instablogs Facebook post, Nazareth Emmanuel commented: Thats not Ifeanyi Okoma thats a member of the commission of works in the state. These discrepancies and assumptions prompted the need to verify the accuracy of the claim, clarify any misrepresentations, and provide the public with reliable information regarding the events in question. We investigated the mans profile being addressed in the video by Governor Soludo. Analysis of the video footage revealed that the man was not Ifeanyi Okoma, the Anambra States Commissioner for Works, as claimed. Upon careful examination through the use of PimEyes, a face search engine tool, cross-referencing, and hints from comment sections, it was established that the man in the video was Paschal Aniegbuna, the chairman of Ogbaru Local Government Area in the state. The discrepancy between the claim and the actual identity of the official addressed by Governor Soludo renders the assertion that the Commissioner for Works was being reprimanded inaccurate. Here is a pictorial illustration differentiating the two individuals: Based on the evidence gathered from the analysis of the video footage and research into the persons involved, it is evident that the claim alleging Governor Soludos public reprimand of the Commissioner for Works, Ifeanyi Okoma, is misleading. The individual addressed by the governor in the video was identified as Paschal Aniegbuna, the chairman of Ogbaru LGA in Anambra State.

"Claim: Some Facebook posts have a claim that Nigerian public universities are set to resume on 15th March. There is a possibility that ASUU resumes after its four-week warning strike. However, the union has not announced its plan to resume on the 15th of March as claimed by social media users. Rather, the union still maintains its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement position. The claim is, therefore, false. As conversations between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Federal Government of Nigeria continue, a breaking news which has a claim that varsities are to resume on 15th March, has been circulating on social media. Aside the need to revitalise public universities, the 2009 agreement between the union and Nigerian government has been a major source of incessant industrial actions, disrupting the education of students in Nigerian public universities. In order to demand the fulfillment of this agreement, ASUU again embarked on its fresh three-week warning strike on 14th of February, 2022. Particularly on Facebook , DUBAWAs finding reveals a breaking news started circulating on Wednesday, 9th of March, 2022. Screenshots of similar posts have been repeatedly forwarded by WhatsApp users in different versions. While stirring controversial comments , some Facebook users have questioned the source of this claim. Despite that, a large number of people believed it to be true. For example, Ismail Abubakar demanded for the source of this claim from one of the posters. Plz stop playing with our emotions , he added to his comment which never got any response. Another user accused a poster of confusing people. He further urged other users to wait for an official announcement. He said: U guyx are saying what u dont knowledge, this not good delete this post, u are confusing people, wait for the anouncement first. Over time, DUBAWA has observed that during significant situations in the country, individuals and blogs dont stop sharing information. Despite that many fail to name their sources, many continue to misinform the public. Going by such an event, has ASUU declared its resumption plan? Information such as this usually makes it to the headlines of national dailies. But on the contrary, DUBAWA could not find any similar news in prominent Nigerian newspapers. News with such anticipated prominence with no actual appearance in any daily signifies a red flag. Furthermore, after careful observations, DUBAWA discovered that the circulating information was written in the same format except with little changes, in a few cases. But while some of them were written with assertions that varsities are resuming, others used the expression expected to resume in their publications. But one thing was common with these different versions, their headlines carry the breaking news or NEW tag. Meanwhile, in a March 7th publication of Premium Times newspaper, ASUU still maintained its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement stance. The union has already assured that it would continue the industrial action until whatever the government wants to do with the agreement is completed and an acceptable implementation commences. This came from the leadership of the union after the minister of education, Adamu Adamu, gave a three-month deadline to the newly inaugurated committee members who are to renegotiate the ASUU-FG 2009 agreement. This further refutes ASUUs resumption plan as claimed. ASUU has not announced its plan to resume on the 15th of March as claimed by social media users. Rather, the union still maintains its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement position.",0
"Claim: An X user posited that Vaseline contains chemicals that cause breast cancer, age skin quickly and disrupt hormones. Verdict: False! Vaseline or petroleum jelly that has been purified does not contain carcinogens or cancer-causing chemicals. Vaseline is a basic skin care product that forms a protective barrier on the skin, helping to lock in moisture and prevent dryness. It is derived from petroleum jelly, acts as a skin protectant, and is effective as an occlusive. Vaseline is used as a skin moisturiser and sometimes for lip care. Its usage is determined by personal preference and specific skin conditions an individual wants to treat. Vaseline is a brand name for petroleum jelly, and the two names are sometimes used interchangeably. Amidst the trending reactions to Manchester Uniteds Andre Onana spotted applying Vaseline on his glove during a football match, an X user made a comparison post between shea butter and Vaseline. The user stated that Vaseline contains chemicals that cause breast cancer, age the skin, and disrupt hormones. On the other hand, the user recommended shea butter as an alternative to Vaseline. Comments under the post reveal varying views from users, with some validating the claim while others opposing it. A user, @Exciting_clips, commented, Tell us exactly the chemicals in Vaseline that cause cancer. Another user, @fisayomiiii, said, Vaseline contains mineral oil/petrolatum, which damages the DNA and is carcinogenic. Ill go with raw, unrefined shea butter. As of this report, the post has garnered 2,800 likes, 862 retweets, 141 comments, and 810 bookmarks. Vaseline is a common skin product used in homes as a moisturiser or lip balm. It is generally considered safe for human use. However, the recent controversy surrounding its use, with concerns that it contains chemicals that can cause cancer, necessitated this article. Available studies show that the aspect of petroleum jelly/Vaseline associated with cancer risk is its crude and unrefined form, which may be contaminated with toxic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), certain types of which have been categorised as carcinogenic. While unrefined versions may harbour harmful ingredients, refined petroleum jelly is generally considered safe. The purity of petroleum jelly varies depending on the quality of its production process. For instance, the Environmental Working Groups Skin Deep scoring system indicates that Vaseline has a low level of exposure to carcinogens and other dangerous ingredients that could lead to cancer. The Skin Deep scoring system conducts hazard ratings on cosmetic products based on their ingredient concerns. The rating system also affirmed that Vaseline does not contain ingredients that expose users to allergies, immunotoxicity, or developmental and reproductive toxicity, making the product safe for human use. Additionally, an explanation of the myths surrounding Vaseline on the Unilever Vaseline website indicates that Vaseline has no known side effects on its users. The explainer answers a question about whether there are side effects from using petroleum jelly or Vaseline. The answer reads, Vaseline Jelly is formulated using a patented triple-purification process. This means the finished product has been purified three times to remove all impurities. Its non-irritating and hypoallergenic. In an article by Good Housekeeping, Dr Marina Peredo, a Fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, commented, There are no clinical studies that demonstrate that the use of petrolatum or petroleum jelly promotes cancer. Todays formulas have been purified and tested and are cleaner and healthier than ever. Scott Rackett, M.D. and Nourage Ambassador, also said, There is no scientific evidence that short-term or long-term use of Vaseline causes cancer or any other health risks. DUBAWA contacted a dermatologist, Dr Ayo Aranmolate, on the concerns that Vaseline contains chemicals that cause breast cancer. He asked, Where do people see this kind of information? Anyway, I am not aware of any specific cancer caused by Vaseline. DUBAWA also contacted the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about whether Vaseline could cause cancer. The FDA is a federal agency responsible for protecting public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of human and veterinary drugs and biological products. In an email to DUBAWA, the FDA noted that the National Toxicology Program (NTP) has a report on carcinogens, and petroleum jelly/petrolatum are not on the list. The NTP report is a cumulative document that consists of 256 listings of substances and chemical, physical, and mixtures that are identified to cause cancer in humans. In its 115th report , released in 2021, petrolatum or petroleum jelly was on the list. Available studies and contributions from experts indicate that Vaseline or other brands of petroleum jelly are safe for use, provided they have a standard refining history.

"Claim: Some social media users claimed the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, usually recommended for girls aged 9 to 14 years, could cause infertility and death in the recipients. Verdict: False! Several studies and experts have confirmed that no scientific evidence supports the belief. Instead, the vaccine helps protect against HPV infection, including cervical cancer. In Oct 2023, the Nigerian government introduced the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine into its routine immunisation drive to reach about seven million girls. The vaccination exercise is mainly targeted at girls aged 9 to 14 years. In Nigeria, the human papillomavirus, a ccording to the UN, is the cause of at least 70% of cases of cervical cancer, the third most common cancer and the second most frequent cause of cancer death in women aged 15 to 44. Muhammad Ali Pate, the Coordinating Minister of Health and Social Welfare, noted that HPV mostly causes cervical cancer, and parents can avoid physical and financial pain by protecting their children with a single dose of the vaccine. He also disclosed that his four daughters had been vaccinated and urged other parents to do the same for their children. The government said a five-day mass vaccination campaign in schools and communities would occur during the inaugural roll-out in 16 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). It added that the vaccine would be incorporated into routine immunisation schedules within health facilities. The second vaccination phase is billed to start in May 2024 in 21 states. The World Health Organization described the human papillomavirus (HPV) as a common sexually transmitted infection that can affect the skin, genital area, and throat. The organization explained that almost all sexually active people would be infected at some point in their lives, though asymptomatic, and the immune system clears HPV from the body. However, persistent infection with high-risk HPV can cause abnormal cells to develop, leading to cancer. Persistent HPV infection of the cervix (the lower part of the uterus or womb, which opens into the vagina also called the birth canal), if left untreated, causes 95% of cervical cancers, the health organization explained. On its part, Cleveland Clinic explained that there are over 100 types of HPV. It, however, said out of these, about 30 HPV strains can affect the genitals, including the vulva, vagina, cervix, penis and scrotum, as well as the rectum and anus. It also noted that while the majority of genital HPV strains are harmless, certain strains of HPV most often types 16 and 18 can cause changes in the cells of the cervix (cervical dysplasia) and, if left untreated, can result in cervical cancer. HPV poses the greatest risk to women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) because high-risk HPV can progress to cervical cancer if its not treated. Pap smears and HPV tests can detect precancerous cell changes early to prevent cancer in your cervix. Harmless forms of HPV can also cause genital warts in women and people AFAB, the clinic explained. While cervical cancer is the most common type of HPV-related cancer, other types of cancer, though rare, that could result from HPV include anal cancer (cancer of the anus); penile cancer (cancer of the penis); throat cancer, vaginal cancer, and vulvar cancer. On the mode of transmission, Medical News Today explained that the human papillomavirus can be transmitted through sexual contact. More worrisome is that transmission can occur regardless of whether symptoms are present. While it is not all HPV infections that can lead to cancer, the risk of cancer increases if the person has other sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia; delivered their first baby at a young age; has given birth to many children; smokes tobacco products and has a weakened immune system. The Centers for Disease Control advised that boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 12 years or as early as nine years should get vaccinated to reduce the risk of getting HPV. Despite government efforts and sensitization around the vaccine, DUBAWA observed growing misinformation around the initiative, discouraging parents and guardians from giving consent. On a private Facebook group, Once A Mum Always A Mum Initiative (OMAM), a user sought other users opinions on the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine. A screenshot of the post on Facebook Within a few hours, some other members of the group replied to her, advising that she should ignore it as it may cause infertility for the daughter in the future or even cause death, as seen in the screenshot below. Another user claimed the vaccine was to reduce the population of the country as it could make young girls sterile. DUBAWA observed that the responses were due to popular misconceptions formed offline, not necessarily what people read on social media. DUBAWA observed that, as a result, several schools struggle to get their female pupils to enrol for the vaccination. In one of the school groups this researcher belongs to, a school administrator posted a circular from the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board titled, Notification of the introduction of the human papillomavirus vaccine into routine immunization (RI) schedule in Nigeria. The circular sensitizes parents and guardians of girls between 9 and 14 to make their wards available for the vaccine. But the school administrator, who does not want her name mentioned for safety reasons, told DUBAWA that the response from the pupils parents was poor. Weve been hearing that the government wants to start immunisation, and parents have already reached out to us that it is lethal injection, that we shouldnt allow their kids to take it. I tried to educate one of them, who insisted it was to kill, and she kept comparing it to the COVID-19 vaccine. I told her this was to prevent cancer, that if I have the opportunity, Id take the vaccine myself, and if my daughter were to be up to the age, Id have registered her for it, she lamented. On efforts she made to make some parent register their children, she said: What we did was to send out a letter, and those who consented were like three (two girls from the same family and one other). We had to call the parents to be sure they were the ones that ticked. Eventually, only four girls took the vaccine. The other girls said their parents didnt consent because they were scared. I met some personally, and they said I wouldnt understand, so I just left them. The school administrator explained that of all the girls over 20 years of age in her school, only four girls were administered the vaccine. She said while three were administered the vaccine in the school, her mother took the fourth girl to the health centre to get the vaccine. Disturbed by the experience, she called on the government to keep educating parents in different indigenous languages on the importance of the vaccine via the media. A research article published in Oct 2022 on HPV prevention by vaccination explained that while the vaccine cannot treat the infection caused by a virus, it can prevent the infection in an individual. The study confirmed various myths and misconceptions about the vaccine in peoples minds and called for effective communication about the effectiveness of vaccines and cancer prevention. According to the study, this will motivate parents to vaccinate their children. The submission of the study is in tandem with a similar research report carried out in Gambella town, Southwest Ethiopia, which emphasised the importance of promoting community health education about HPV infection and vaccines and providing behaviour change education. Another article published on PubMed x-rayed the long-term effects of the HPV vaccination in clinical trials and real-world data. Findings from the study showed that the preventive development of HPV vaccines against anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers has been proven in both clinical trials and real-world data. It, however, suggested that while most girls and boys are inoculated with the HPV vaccine by the time puberty begins, it is crucial to monitor the vaccine effect at least until the sexually active period in their 20s and 30s. To further dispel the misinformation around HPV vaccination, DUBAWA engaged two obstetricians/gynaecologists on the fears expressed by parents and the importance of the vaccine. Dr Nathaniel Adewole, associate professor of obstetrics and gynaecology and chief consultant gynaecologist at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, told DUBAWA that there is no correlation between the vaccine and death or infertility as claimed. Adewole said the HPV vaccine is administered to reduce incidences of cervical cancer the same way the polio vaccine is to reduce the incidence of polio. He added that cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death among women in Nigeria. HPV vaccine has nothing to do with infertility. It has nothing to do with death. If people had died from it, there would have been a public outcry. The earlier they allow the kids to take it, the better. Cervical cancer can bring a multi-millionaire to zero. It shouldnt be taken as a joke; anyone with this opportunity by the government should not let it slide. At least, after a long time, we are seeing the Nigerian government complementing the international organisations in being futuristic about our health and the health of our children, he said. The obstetrician and gynaecologist explained that girls in the targeted age category (9 to 14) must get vaccinated before they become sexually active to prevent them from having cervical cancer and other related infections. He also called on parents to embrace the initiative. This is a huge investment by the government. It is a good initiative. The vaccine is costly for the government to say its now free, and people are saying something else. Remember, it is the same people that developed vaccines to reduce polio, measles, whooping cough, and many other things, he said. Also speaking, Dr Qudus Lawal, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo State, said the HPV vaccine is safe, and there are lots of studies to back up this claim. He said there was no cause for alarm as the program had been on since 2006 in developed countries with over 270 million doses of the vaccine administered without any recorded incidence of infertility or death resulting from the vaccine. Dr Lawal attributed the misinformation around the vaccine in Nigeria to the uniqueness of the vaccination programme, the fact that it targets only females and children outside the normal age you vaccinate, and the fact that the infection has a relationship with sexual intercourse which we often see as a taboo. He also explained that Nigerias extant vaccination campaign is targeted at only girls due to limited resources. In countries like Australia, the UK, and some parts of the world, they vaccinate both male and female, but in resource-limited countries, we vaccinate only the girl child for now, he said. Dr Lawal said the alleged deaths linked to HPV vaccinations were unfounded, adding that in scientific engagement, we have a way of detecting if something is a cause of something. For instance, if a person takes coke now and two minutes later, he goes out and has a road traffic accident and dies in the process, you cant say it is the coke that resulted in his death. So, most of these people try to link up two unrelated events and say it is a vaccine that caused a certain thing. There is no scientific evidence to support that HPV vaccine is associated with all of these, he said. The claim that the HPV vaccine can cause infertility and death in human beings is false. There is no scientific evidence to support it.",0
"Claim: CareerNG on Facebook claims Julius Berger is recruiting. Verdict: False! Details on the flyer show it is a call for applications from BUA Group. The link attached to the post redirected visitors to a visa application site unrelated to Julius Berger or BUA. Online recruitment advertising has become one of the most popular employment methods. However, like all online activities, job hunting carries certain risks that people must be aware of and take precautions against. CareerNG on Facebook posted a flyer of BUA recruiting with the caption, This is your opportunity to work with Julius Berger. Application is Ongoing. Apply Now. Despite the glaring contraction between the caption and the flyer, the comment section was flooded with many inquiries on how they could apply for the Job. The post garnered 9,500 likes, 1,100 comments, and 158 shares since this report was shared on Feb 13, 2024. We noticed the virality of the post and the discrepancy between the flyer and the caption. We also noticed that almost everyone in the comments showed interest, so we decided to verify the post. We observed that although the post said the application was for Julius Berger, the flyer attached showed the application was for BUA Group. We looked into the link attached to the post. When we clicked on the link, we saw that it redirected us to Canada job opportunities with visa sponsorship 2024, which is entirely unrelated to any job recruitment. We also checked the links authenticity using Scam Adviser and saw that the link review had a low trust score. The website appears to be hosted by a bad reputation company. Accessing a website hosted by such a corporation can result in sluggish pages, no dependability because the website can be pulled down at any time, insecurity of any data you provide across such a platform, and so on, Scam Adviser revealed. We visited the BUA website and noticed that the image attached to the post suggested BUA is recruiting. We found a call for applications for different positions available on its website. We also visited Julius Bergers official website to confirm if there is any ongoing recruitment. We noticed that the company has a section dedicated to Job vacancies, but none is running. To ensure the best online experience and the security of your data, we urge that you only interact with websites hosted by reputable companies. The information on the post, flyer, and link do not correspond. Furthermore, there is no evidence that Julius Berger is recruiting.",0
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims nobody is President-elect in the United State until the safe harbour period (between November 3 and December 8) is over. Mostly True. While it is true there is a safe harbour deadline and other timelines before the swearing-in of the president, the use of the term President-elect is not forbidden and has been used for years to refer to a presidential candidate who has won the majority vote. The United State of Americas presidential election which took place last Tuesday, November 3, 2020, has become the centre of discussion as the world continues to pay close attention to events as they unfold. The election between Donald Trump of the Republican Party and Joe Biden of the Democratic Party was a close battle but so far Joe Biden beat incumbent President, Donald Trump, by scoring 273 electoral college votes against Trumps 214 votes. However, a viral WhatsApp message claims no one is president-elect until the harbour period is over. This harbour period has been described as the period between November 3 and and December 8 within which elections are held, result counted, votes certified by states, electoral bodies, electoral colleges, and all court cases are resolved. The message went further to say that after this period, on December 14, the President, the Vice President, and electors from all electoral colleges will be elected. Afterward, on December 23, states must send all verified votes and electoral college votes to the president of the Senate who is the current Vice President. Subsequently, on January 3, a new senate and house of representatives are sworn in, after which the president of the new senate takes the votes to the new senate to recount and presents the results to the house on January 6. According to the message, it is on this day that the president is known, after official swearing in is done on January 20. Anything short of this, the message noted is just entertainment. The United States (U.S) presidential election is a two-step process. The general voters cast their ballots to elect the electors who in turn meet to formally elect the President. In the U.S whose democracy is over 200 years old, there is no central or federal electoral commission that conducts the presidential election. All elections (federal, state, and local) are conducted by each of the 50 states and the capital territory. And this includes choosing the electors in the Electoral College that elects the president. While Americans took to the polls on November 3, 2020 and voted, they have not really selected the next president of the United States. Technically, the president and vice-president are selected by a group of electors, collectively known as the Electoral College. In a nutshell, when voters go to the polls, they are voting for the Electoral College, which then elects the president and vice-president. This means winning the democratic popular vote in the U.S does not determine who is president but winning the Electoral College vote. Although the winner is mostly known once the election is over, members of the Electoral College, however, statutorily meet on December 14 to ratify the election of the winner . The Electoral College is made up of temporarily selected state representatives known as electors. In total, there are 538 members of the Electoral College, representing the 50 states and the nations capital, Washington, District of Columbia (D.C.). The winner of the elections must win at least 270 votes. The constitution of the United States mandates that the number of the electors equals the number of congressional delegations, that is, the total number of senators and house of representatives. A 1961 constitutional amendment further increased the number of electors to include representation from D.C which has no member of congress. The total number of electors is broken down into: 100 Senators, 435 House of Representatives and 3 electors representing Washington D.C. While each state has exactly two senators, the number of House of Representatives depends on the number of congressional districts which can vary. For example, while states like New York and Florida both have 27 representatives, others like Alaska and Delaware each have one. California has the highest number of representatives with 53 members. This year, the Electoral College will meet on December 14, following the general elections, to cast their ballots for the president and vice-president in the individual states and D.C. Usually, the votes of the electoral college is presumed to be based on the outcome of the general elections and the general rules followed by each state. Individual states determine how members of the Electoral College vote. It is worthy of note that the majority of states follow a winner-takes-all approach, that is, whoever gets the majority votes in the general elections in each state automatically wins all Electoral College votes in that state. Forty-eight states follow this rule while Maine and Nebraska, follow an Electoral College voting system that splits the Electoral College votes between congressional district voter outcome and the state-wide outcome According to article II section 1 of the U.S constitution , each state is responsible for appointing electors who shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. They shall subsequently make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number of votes for each. These votes are signed and certified, and transmitted sealed to the seat of the government of the United State, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall then in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed. But if there is more than one who has such a majority and an equal number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately choose by ballot one of them for President. But if eventually, no person has a majority, then from the five highest on the list, the said House shall in like manner choose the President. But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by States, the representation from each state having one vote. A quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. Note that the Congress may determine the time of choosing the electors, and the day on which they shall give their votes. This day shall be the same throughout the United States. Currently, Biden, a former vice president under Barack Obama, passed the 270 electoral vote threshold needed for victory on Saturday November 7, 2020, winning the states of Pennsylvania and Nevada. While Biden has started making plans for office , President Donald Trump is yet to concede defeat on grounds of voting fraud noting he will continue to challenge results in several states. Biden reacting to Trumps refusal to concede defeat said it is embarrassing. Despite this win, there are a few things that must happen before a new term begins. This period is described as the transition phase. This phase is the period between the election result and the start of the new presidential term on 20 January. Within this period, the incoming president is to assemble a group called a transition team which prepares to assume power immediately after inauguration. So far Biden has set up his team already. The new term of office begins January 20, 2021, when a ceremony called the inauguration takes place in the capital, Washington DC. A report by the British Broadcasting Corporation/(BBC) highlighted and explained terms that will be frequently used during this period. First is the term President-elect. A candidate who wins the election but is yet to be sworn in as the new president on January 20, is referred to as President-elect. Also, the term Cabinet will be used for the top team at the highest level of government which will be announced by Joe Biden. This team includes heads of all the key departments and agencies. This will, however, require approval from the Senate. The people picked by Mr Biden are interviewed by Senate committees in a hearing known as the confirmation hearing which is followed by a vote to approve or reject. Another keyword is Celtic. As president-elect, Biden gets increased protection from the Secret Service and his codename is Celtic. These names are chosen by the candidate. For Trump it was Mogul and Kamala Harris has reportedly picked Pioneer. The safe harbor period which was referred to in the viral WhatsApp message has been made reference to in different documents regarding the election as the safe harbor deadline. This deadline is December 8,2020. An explainer article by Bloomberg noted this as a period where states have the opportunity to resolve any dispute around votes cast and certify these votes. The 2020 presidential election timeline by the electoral college also discussed this, noting it is a deadline set for states to resolve anything around vote contestation after which the governor of that state is to send a certificate describing how the determination was made to the Archivist as soon as practicable. The term president-elect is used to refer to a candidate who has met the requirements of winning an election. For decades, this term has been used by the media to describe the presidential candidate with the most electoral votes. A report by Aljazeera described Joe Biden as president-elect having passed the 270 vote electoral college threshold needed to claim victory in the 2020 presidential election. In a similar report Joe Biden was referred to as president-elect. However, this unofficial term is generating controversy in this years election. NBC12 in its report noted it had received complaints about calling Joe Biden President-elect. The Phrase , president-elect appears in the 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933. It is used there to allow the vice president-elect to become president if a President-elect dies before taking the oath of office. According to the Executive Director of UVA Center for Politics, Larry Sabato, the term president-elect is not new. The difference is they liked the result in 2016 and they dont like the result in 2020. In the old days, you didnt have a president-elect until the Electoral College met; thats when the title becomes official Excerpt of Sabatos comment. The Chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, Rich Anderson, said the use of the term is no big deal to him but to be technically precise, nobody has the title of president-elect. Until an Electoral College winner has been determined there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of unknowns, which is what were seeing play out now. Excerpt of Andersons comment. The U.S Constitution only speaks on the availability of the person who has won the presidential election to take the oath of office. There is no indication when that person actually becomes president-elect. The General Services Administration is tasked with formally recognising the president-elect and providing the funds and access to federal agencies that his team needs. It is true there is a safe harbour deadline of December 8 in the U.S. presidential election as noted by the electoral college election timeline and other reports. The term president-elect is, however, an unofficial term used to describe a candidate who has won the majority of electoral votes. Although it is not found in the U.S Constitution, it is in the 20th Amendment, ratified in 1933.",1
"Claim: Several users have shared a document on WhatsApp from the Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL), claiming that it is the disaggregated result of the just concluded general elections. Verdict: Misleading. The document is not the disaggregated result. It is a breakdown of the number of voters distributed by polling centres nationwide. Several people recently shared a document on WhatsApp, claiming that it is the disaggregated result of the just concluded elections. The documents title is Voter Count by Polling Station. The title indicates that it could be the tallied results by the polling station. At a time when there has been a desire for information about the just-ended election, many have been left vulnerable to misinformation. The document has five columns labelled as; number, district, centre name, location and voter count. The viral results on WhatsApp come when the release of the disaggregated results from polling stations have been at the centre of the oppositions call. Among other demands, the All Peoples Congress has repeatedly called for the total result t o be released by polling station. So is this viral data purported to have emanated from the ECSL authentic, and is it the results of the just-ended polls in Sierra Leone? DUBAWA contacted the Director of External Relations at the Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone, Albert Massaquoi, to verify the documents authenticity. He confirmed that the document was from ECSL, but its not the election result, as some claimed. He added that the viral document was released before the election. The column indicating polling centre count expressly put out the number of registrants that registered during the voter registration process between Sept 4 to Oct 3 of 2022. The ECSL later established a policy that determines the number of voters entitled to a polling station. depending on the number of persons registered at that location (centre). Massaqoui said depending on the number, they decided to use 300 as the threshold of voters to set up each polling station. In other words, every 300 voters at a location (centre) determine how many stations are set up within the centre (location). For example, one station is equal to 300 voters. So, two stations are equal to 600 voters and three stations 900 voters equal to three (polling) stations, he clarified. In response to calls to release the data, he said ECSL is under no legal obligation to release the data. Massaquoi said: It is not in law, but it is best practice. Eventually, the commission will do that soon. He added that in the last two elections, 2018 and 2012, it was released months after the general elections. The viral document is not a disaggregated election result. It is a breakdown of voters by polling stations across the country.",0

"Claim: The Chief Spokesperson of the Obi-Datti Organisation, Yunusa Tanko, asserted that there was no single armed robbery case during Peter Obis tenure as governor of Anambra State. Verdict: False! Findings revealed robbery incidents in Anambra when Peter Obi was the state governor. Over the years, insecurity has been a significant threat to Nigerias stability and development. While banditry and terrorism continue to wreak havoc across the Northern parts of the country, other areas in the South battle with sit-at-home orders by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) . During a conversation about the general situation in the nation, Yunusa Tanko, the official spokesperson of the Obi-Datti Organisation, claimed that Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections, did not record any case of armed robbery when he was the Governor of Anambra State. There was no single armed robbery in Anambra State when Peter Obi was the governor [of the state], he stated between 43rd and 54th seconds of the video. Mr Tanko said this in a heated argument with Kassim Afegbua, a chieftain and 2024 governorship aspirant of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Edo State. Mr Tanko and Mr Afegbua were guests on Mic on Podcast , a political programme held every Saturday to discuss political issues hosted by Seun Okinbaloye , a broadcast journalist with Channels Television. As of this report, the interactive show has been viewed by 14,000 users and has about 150 likes on YouTube, where it was originally live-streamed on June 1, 2024. DUBAWAs investigation shows that the video has been featured on other platforms, including here and here . The sensitive nature of the claim prompted DUBAWA to investigate its veracity. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on the security situation in Anambra State and found a Daily Trust report published in 2015. It analysed the number of reported cases of armed robbery in Nigeria, showing that Lagos, Anambra, and Abia States were the top robbery spots in Nigeria between 2007 and 2011. It is noteworthy that Mr Obi served twice as the governor of Anambra State, from 2006 to 2010, and was re-elected for a second term that ended in 2014. Lagos recorded the highest number of cases within the period, totalling 742, while Anambra and Abia trailed behind Lagos with 549 and 544 cases, respectively. According to the Daily Trust report, the reported armed robbery cases in these three states were more than the total number recorded in the six North-central or Northeast states. Further research through the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that 549 armed robbery cases were recorded in Anambra State during Mr Obis tenure as governor. After carefully examining the document, a breakdown of the reported robbery incidents shows 96 confirmed cases in 2007, 69 in 2008, 240 in 2009, 94 in 2010, and 50 in 2011. In summary, 549 armed robbery cases are the total number recorded from Anambra State during Mr Obis tenure. See Table 192 on Page 197. Additionally, various credible media outlets published different robbery reports in Anambra State during Peter Obis governorship here , here , and here . Mr Tankos assertion that Anambra did not have a record of armed robbery during Peter Obis tenure as governor is false. Findings show there were 549 cases of armed robbery attacks between 2007 and 2011 alone.",0
"Claim: A Facebook page shares that UBA is offering business loans. Verdict: Misleading! There is no link to the verified UBA page. The official website does not show such information, and red flags were discovered from talking with the agents. Financial institutions, like the United Bank For Africa (UBA), give out loans to their customers to help them. In this regard, scammers also are always on the lookout for unsuspecting customers to rip them off their hard-earned money.

In the comment section, different people kept indicating interest in the loan application. The Facebook page had different loan posts and other pages , so we decided to verify the posts authenticity. We contacted the page to talk to them about getting a loan and noticed some red flags during the conversation. The user asked that we share our account number and phone number, the last four digits of the atm card, the debit card pin, the expiry card date, and the one-time password(OTP) that will be sent to the phone number. So, we spoke to a UBA bank staff member, Seyi, who mentioned that getting a loan from a bank should not require giving out sensitive information like card details and OTP. No staff will ever ask you for your card details. It is personal information. If someone asks, know that they are out to scam you. Confirm from your account officer first before trusting someone on the internet, no matter the name they use. During our discussion with the agent, we noticed the unprofessional writing style, for example, repetition of words and grammatical errors. We ran a Google Advance Search on the name of the Facebook page. We saw variants of the different pages like accounts Uba Easy Loan Foundation Services Nigeria, Uba Easy Loan Foundation Services, Uba Easy Loan Foundation Services Nigeria, Uba Loan, and Uba Easy Loan Foundation Services Nigeria. This makes it fake. The original site for requesting a loan is on the banks website . The official page for getting verified information, UBA Group , did not call for collecting loans on their page, making the original post fake. Scammers are always out to get people, especially during festive seasons. People should talk to their account officers about sensitive issues. Based on our investigation, we saw that the page is fake and fraudulent.",1
"Claim: A news media institution claimed that Matenokay Tingban had been declared a candidate in an ensuing Nimba by-election Verdict: Misleading! NEC says it has not declared any candidates for the Nimba elections. The county of Nimba, in Liberia, is set to go to a senatorial bye-election on April 22 this year. This follows the death of Senator Prince Johnson, who many regarded as the political god-father of the county. As defined by Liberias election authority, the National Elections Commission (NEC), a by-election is any election called to fill vacancies created by an unexpired term in an elective position other than the president and vice president. In the wake of activities leading to election day, a news media institution, Hott FM, published on Facebook that a former Nimba lawmaker, Matenokay Tingban, had been declared a candidate in an ensuing election. DUBAWA verified the news as part of efforts to promote truth during elections. Verification DUBAWA read through the by-election key dates as published by the NEC. Picture of the key dates from the NEC. The candidate nomination period began on March 3 and ended on March 14, 2025. The provisional list of candidates was made public on March 17, 2025. The election commission sets March 31, 2025, as the date for the publication of the final list of candidates. DUBAWA also contacted the NEC through its Communications Director, Prince Dunbar , to verify the information coming from Hott FM further. Dunbar said the NEC has not declared any candidates for the upcoming election. We have no candidates, he said. NEC has not declared anybody as a candidate yet. He said publishing the provisional list does not mean a person is a candidate in the election. The provisional list means that we have received the documents of some people, and we are scrutinising the documents, Dunbar said. On the 31st of March, the final list of candidates will be published. Hott FMs post that Matenokay Tingban has been declared a candidate in the Nimba by-election is misleading.",1
"Claim: Photo showing the statue of Victor Osimhen in Napoli. Verdict: The image was sourced from the internet, doctored and used to push a false narrative. On April 13, 2024, Emeka Yankee , a Facebook user, posted the photograph of a monument said to be the statue of Victor Osimhen in Napoli. Describing the picture, he wrote: Status of Victor Osimehn in Napoli. No, forget to follow Emeka Yankee. Mr Osimhen, 25, is a professional footballer from Nigeria. He plays as a striker for the Nigerian national team and Serie A club in Napoli, a city in Southern Italy. The footballer is famous for his record-breaking transfer to Napoli in 2020 at about 70 million, making him the most expensive African player in history at the time. In June 2023, Angu Lesley , an X user, made a similar claim . He attached the same image to his post: VICTOR OSIMHENs STATUE has erected in NAPOLI to honour him for bringing them back their pride. What a historic gesture!!! Considering the subjects prominence and the recurring nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to carry out this fact check. Upon close inspection of the image, we noticed several odd aspects. Although artisans can craft lifelike sculptures, the image appears like a photograph. So, we conducted a keyword search on Google. This revealed multiple blog posts supporting the same claim under examination. We then conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the photo. This led us to a replica of the image. However, it was a typical statue and not of the football star. The alleged statue of Mr Osimhen. Photo Source: Grandenapoli. In the images above, item number one shows the photo of Mr Osimehn and the statue of Dante Alighieri, an Italian poet and philosopher. The Dante Alighieri statue , found in Napoli, Italy, was inaugurated on July 13, 1871. The monument was created by two sculptorsTito Angelini and Tommaso Solari juniorand placed on a base designed by Gherardo Rega. As it can be perceived, Mr Alighieris statue was removed from the base and replaced with the footballers photograph, perhaps through Photoshop. Item two on the images is identical. It depicts a woman sitting while a man wearing a black t-shirt and a baseball cap stands before her. The scene becomes clearer in the second image, where additional people stand beside them. This suggests that the original image was cropped. Two noticeable details in item three: individuals seated next to a parked bicycle and two white canopies across the square. Furthermore, we analysed the viral image using Invid , an image verification tool. The result flagged the entire area where Mr Osimhens photo appeared, confirming that this image had been doctored. We also pinpointed the exact location of the piece of art through Google Maps. A street view image from April 2023 confirmed that it remains in place. Our findings proved that the image used to depict Mr Osimhens statue in Napoli was doctored. The claim is false.",0

"Claim: Facebook users Heritage Blog and The Great Africa claim that the Confederation of African Footballs (CAF) disciplinary committee has issued four sanctions on Libya for their treatment of the Super Eagles. Verdict: DUBAWAs findings reveal that all four claims are FALSE. On Oct 15, 2024, social media was flooded with reports that Nigerias senior mens national team, the Super Eagles, had been held at Al Abraq Airport in Libya by local authorities upon their arrival for the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying Group D match against the Mediterranean Knights. In viral videos, players and officials, along with their luggage, were stranded at the airport. Reports, here , here and here indicated that the Nigerian team were left without food or water for over 20 hours, completely cut off from communication. Some Super Eagles players, including Troost-Ekong and Victor Boniface , expressed their frustration about the poor treatment on social media. Following the incident, CAF, via its official X (formerly Twitter) account, announced that it would set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the situation. Amid the ongoing discussions, Facebook users Heritage Blog and The Great Africa , on Oct 24, 2024, posted several claims regarding CAFs actions against Libya: 1. The Disciplinary Committee of the Confederationn of African Football (CAF) has bann Libya from hosting Home matches and finedd them $100,000, following maliciousss treatmentt against Nigeriaa Senior Team Super Eagles Nigeria 2. The match will be replayed in Nigeria as part of their punishmentt 3. Nigeria is next to host AFCON Cup tournament. Finally if Libya can afford to pay their fine in 2 days from now the match will be replayed in Morocco! Are these claims true? DUBAWA looked into them. DUBAWA investigated these claims and noted several spelling errors in the post, such as Confederationn, maliciousss, and bann, which raised questions about the informations credibility. Claim 1 : The CAF Disciplinary Committee has banned Libya from hosting home matches and fined them $100,000 for their treatment of the Super Eagles. Verdict: FALSE DUBAWAs findings reveal that, on Oct. 26, 2024, the Disciplinary Committee of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) ordered the Libyan Football Federation to pay a $50,000 fine, which must be settled within 60 days of the notification of this decision. Claim 2 : The match will be replayed in Nigeria as part of Libyas punishment but if Libya pays the fine within two days, the match will be replayed in Morocco. Verdict: FALSE Contrary to this claim, CAF did not mandate a replay of the match in Nigeria. Instead, CAF awarded the Super Eagles of Nigeria three points and three goals for the abandoned matchday 4 fixture of the 2025 AFCON qualifier against Libya. Also, CAFs ruling did not stipulate that a match replay will occur in Morocco if Libya pays the fine within two days. Instead, the ruling requires Libya to pay the USD 50,000 fine within 60 days. Claim 3 : Nigeria is next to host the AFCON tournament Verdict: FALSE According to CAFs official website , Morocco, not Nigeria, has been selected to host the upcoming AFCON tournament. The CAF Disciplinary Board met to deliberate on the Total Energies CAF AFCON Morocco 2025 Qualifier that was scheduled between Libya and Nigeria. The Disciplinary Board decided as follows: 1. Libya Football Federation was found to have breached Article 31 of the Total Energies CAF Africa Cup of Nations Regulations as well as Articles 82 and 151 of the CAF Disciplinary Code. 2. The match No.87 Libya v. Nigeria of the TotalEnergies CAF African Cup of Nations Qualifiers 2025 (scheduled to be played on 15 October 2024 in Benghazi) is declared lost by forfeit by Libya (by a score of 3-0). 3. The Libya Football Federation is ordered to pay a fine of USD 50,000. The fine is to be paid within 60 days of notification of the present decision. 4. All other and further motions or prayers for relief are dismissed. The findings from DUBAWA show that each claim regarding CAFs decisions was found to be false. The official CAF ruling penalized the Libyan Football Federation with a fine of USD 50,000 but did not include any provisions for a match replay, either in Nigeria or Morocco. Additionally, Morocco is confirmed as the host of the next AFCON, not Nigeria.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims WhatsApp has altered its privacy policy to offer government exclusive access to users privacy. The viral WhatsApp message that claims WhatsApp has altered its privacy policy to offer government exclusive access to users privacy is false. WhatsApp has discredited the message and the message has also failed to offer sufficient proof to support its claims. A viral WhatsApp message claims that WhatsApp has changed its privacy policy to offer the government full access to users day-to-day privacy. The message warns users of this change as follows: Be mindful of your chats I WsAs s s 1. = ss s. 2. = ss . 3. T = ss . T = T ss. 5. T = s . 6. O = s . 7. T = T s s s s ss s.

Other users who appeared to consent to the users comment reinforced the view. While the origin of the message could not be traced to anyone in particular, its wide reach has captured the WhatsApp indicator for viral messages: Forwarded multiple times. Social media is already a controversial topic in Nigeria, and its censorship, much to the dismay of the populace, has been pushed by the government as a viable policy. Recently, a total of N4.8 (4,870,350,000) billion naira was allocated to the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) to monitor WhatsApp messages, phone calls, text messages, among others. Perhaps its this turn of events that triggered the multiple shares of the acclaimed WhatsApp message in question. After an advance search of the content of the message on the internet, results show that multiple fact checks have been conducted on the same claim. In fact, the same message has circulated across different countries. In India, the message went viral attracting fact-checks from IndiaToday and Times of India among others. It was widely found to be false and misleading. WhatsApp has also made its stance on the message, debunking it with an official statement on its website .

"By Steve Dede Claim: Nigerias Information Minister Lai Mohammed denied that he once announced a N5 million fine on hate speech in Nigeria. Contrary to Lai Mohammeds denial, he did announce the increment of fine on hate speech from N500, 000 to N5 million as evident in the available video clip. After the report that the Federal Government imposed a N5m fine on hate speech on broadcast stations in Nigeria, Lagos based radio station Nigeria Info 99.3FM was one of the first broadcast stations to be hit with the fine. This development prompted a human rights lawyer, Inibehe Efiong, to challenge the imposition of the fine in court. Mr Effiong also challenged the threat by the National Broadcasting Commission to punish other broadcast stations in the country over alleged hate speech. In a counter-affidavit in response to a motion filed by the human right lawyer, Lai Mohammed denied ever announcing the increment of the fine from N500, 000 to N5, 000,000. Paragraph 19 is denied. The 2nd defendant (Mohammed) did not announce an increment in any fine for hate speech from N500,000 to N5,000,000 or any other because there is a governmental body or institution mandated to regulate and enforce the Nigerian Broadcasting Code, Punch quoted from the affidavit. Contrary to his denial, Mr Mohammed did announce the increment of the fine. On Tuesday, August 4, 2020, Nigerias Minister of Information Lai Mohammed announced that the Federal Government had increased the fine for hate speech from N500, 000 to N5m. Although there have been earlier reports that the Federal Government was planning to increase the fine from N500, 000 to N5 million, Mr Mohammed on that day confirmed the speculation. During the unveiling of the Reviewed Broadcasting code, the Minister said a presidential directive necessitated the amendments in the wake of the 2019 general elections. While announcing the amendment of the Broadcasting Code, the minister said; Another highlight of the amendment is the provision that has raised the fine for hate speeches from half a million Naira to N5m. This will serve as a deterrent to those who want to use our broadcast stations to sow the seed of discord. A detailed search on this finds Lai Mohammeds announcement of the increase in the fine for hate speech between 10:48- 11:22 minute mark of a video on Channels TV Youtube page. A search on the subject on Google also brings several results from credible and popular media platforms like Premium Times , Punch, Naira Metrics and Pulse who reported Lai Mohammeds announcement. Lai Mohammed did announce the Federal Governments increment of the hate speech fine from N500, 000 to N5 million. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Pulse.ng to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim : On Oct. 26, 2023, Independent Probe Newspaper published that representative Yekeh Kolubah, a staunch supporter of the opposition Unity Party, endorsed the re-election of President George Weah in the run-off elections. Verdict : Cannot be proven. The lawmaker, via a WhatsApp call with DUBAWA, denied endorsing President Weah in the run-off. The Editor of the Probe Newspaper also said that he could not provide evidence for the assertion because the papers conversation with Mr Kolubah was not recorded. Representative Yekeh Kolubah of District#10 in Montserrado County has, over the years, been a critic of the George Weah-led government. The lawmaker has always repeated the need to remove the administration of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) from power due to what he believes to be widespread corruption, injustice, poor economy, amongst others. However, on Oct. 26, 2023, the Independent Probe Newspaper (IPNEWS) published on its website an article about the lawmaker pledging his support to the Presidential bid of the CDC in the run-off elections scheduled for Nov. 14. The run-off is between President George Weah of the CDC and Amb. Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party. Breaking News: Rep. Yekeh Kolubah Endorses President George Weahs Reelection, Independent Probe quoted. According to the media outlet, Kolubah, in a live phone interview, told them that the CDC is not a bad party. The website quoted Yekeh as saying, The opposition Unity Party is unable to deliver Liberia from current circumstances. In a live phone-in with IPNEWS, Representative Kolubah stated that the CDC is not a bad party, so whats wrong with me endorsing President Weah? The website was published. The story featured a photo of the lawmaker wearing a white cap with figure two on it a paraphernalia of the governing CDC government which appeared to have given credence to the report. The newspaper also quoted Rep. Kolubah as saying, The JNB team cant deliver Liberia from its current condition, given the fact that criminals surround him. The report has sparked speculation and confusion amongst supporters of the two major political parties ahead of the run-off. The news has circulated on social media , blogs, and other platforms. This led DUBAWA to fact-check the assertion. DUBAWA contacted the lawmaker Yekeh Kolubah via a WhatsApp call. However, he denied ever endorsing Mr Weah. Representative Kolubah stated that if he is to endorse anybody, it wont be done in a closed-door meeting but publicly. According to him, the article is only meant to spread false news to the public. Is that how to endorse someone? Im a well-known man, and if I decide to endorse anybody, I will openly endorse them, Rep. Kolubah said. Also, DUBAWA contacted Mr Chester Smith, Editor of the Independent Probe Newspaper, for evidence of his publication. However, the Editor couldnt provide any substantial evidence to back up the claim. He stated that he did not record the interview with Mr Kolubah. Screenshot below On Sunday, Oct. 29, 2023, the Lawmaker hosted a press conference at his office in Old Road and clarified that he didnt endorse President George Weah but only wore the party campaign material for fun in the office of Speaker Bhofal Chambers. I can never support George Weah. For the past six years, Ive been speaking on negative things done by this government, so what will I say to the Liberian people if I endorse George Weah? I respect my family name and will not sell my integrity for little or nothing. I wore the CDC campaign material for fun. It is not my first time wearing their materials, Representative Kolubah said. There is no evidence supporting the claim Independent Probe Newspaper attributed to the lawmaker. DUBAWA has gathered that Mr Kolubah didnt endorse President George Weah in the run-off elections.",1
"Claim: WhatsApp message claims that a bottled water brand called DEW, which has caused the deaths of 180 people in Tanzania, has now been shipped to Nigeria. Verdict: False. There is no credible evidence to support this claim. We discovered that it is a recurring allegation, and NAFDAC debunked it in 2011. Health-related misinformation spreads quickly, causing panic and fear. Claims about contaminated products can make people avoid safe items out of fear. With social media amplifying such messages, it becomes hard to know the truth. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message warning people against consuming a bottled water brand called DEW has been widely shared on social media platforms such as Facebook . The message claims that the product was imported from Tanzania and has allegedly caused 180 deaths due to poisoning. It further states that Nigerian Customs has warned against drinking the water, urging people to share the information to save lives. We knew the post had gone viral after seeing WhatsApps forwarded many times tag . Urgent; please pass this to any loved onesI just got this information now. Please dont buy or drink any bottled water called DEW. Customs said it was shipped into Nigeria from Tanzania, where it has killed 180 people. It is said to contain a poisonous chemical. Please pass this on and save millions. If you dont believe it, check Google for DEW bottled water. Save lives, as I just saved yours. Forwarded as received, the text reads. A screenshot of the viral message circulating. Because this claim can raise public concern, especially as Nigeria has faced past food and beverage contamination incidents, making people more susceptible to such warnings, DUBAWA decided to investigate. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on the Dew bottled water and could not find anything online. We then saw that the claim had surfaced online in 2011 when the National Agency for Food Administration and Control (NAFDAC) debunked it. In the statement, the Agency explained that no poisonous dew water was circulating in the country. Investigations by NAFDAC in several hospitals across the nation showed no hospitalisation or death arising from the consumption of the said Dew water or any other brand of water. Seeing the information was credited to Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), we scanned its website for any information related to Dew water. According to the NCS, bottled water is on the import prohibition list, which means it could not have been imported to Nigeria. This further explains why the claim is false. Furthermore, our web search did not reveal the existence of this Dew bottled water or any reported deaths in Tanzania or elsewhere attributed to such a brand. This claim is a recurring one from 2011. According to the import prohibition list, bottled water can not be imported to Nigeria. We also saw that no death was recorded in Tanzania.",1
"Claim : A viral video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp claims that the Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria. The video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp, with the claim that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria is false as verification has revealed the bodies were from an accident that happened in Tanzania in 2019. Recently, a 29-seconds video was shared multiple times on WhatsApp purporting that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria. The video showed numerous burnt corpses, burnt out wreckages of motorcycles piled together, voices in the background were heard speaking in an unrecognized language, and a huge burning fire and what appeared to be paid workers moving around. The video which looks like a tanker explosion scene was accompanied with the caption that reads: Corpses of Fulani bandits as they were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in the North. God is responding to the prayers of the church. Its gory pls. Dont bother to open pls it if you are sensitive to gory images First of all, this reporter observed that the same video has been used to depict the Nigerian military onslaught on terrorists in Zamfara recently, which Dubawa tagged to be false. So this researcher went on to take screenshots of the video to capture relevant frames and subjected it to reverse image searches. Using reverse image tools Tineye and INVID on the image yielded zero result. Further verifications on Yandex reverse image search revealed that the video has been making the rounds since 2019, as it has appeared in several publications and Facebook pages, one of which was a post by Random FB videos on 5 September 2019, with the caption This is provocative enough to cause war South Africa, indicating that it happened in South Africa. Another publication by norskk square space on 18 September 2021, with the title South Africa a Failed State, claimed that utter chaos and unfathomable violence and savagery is so common in African states, showcasing pictures it claims were images of the common genocides in Africa and that some of the frames were taken from this video. A keyword search revealed that the video was first shot in 2019 when an oil tanker explosion killed at least 60 people and wounded scores more in Tanzania. The tanker was heading from Dar es Salaam, Tanzanias largest city to the countrys capital and overturned in the town of Morogoro, according to an Aljazeera report. The report explained that the residents of the community besieged the area in an attempt to scoop fuel when the fuel tanker exploded and more than 60 lives were lost. The video showing several burnt bodies on WhatsApp and claiming that Fulani bandits were struck, burnt and roasted by lightning from heaven while on their way to attack a Christian community in Northern Nigeria is false as verification has revealed that the accident happened in Tanzania and the video was shot in 2019 when an oil tanker exploded in Morogoro.

"Claim: Multiple reports claim that Guinness is leaving Nigeria due to the countrys economic havoc. Verdict: False! The manufacturing company is not leaving the country. Tolaram Group only bought 58.02% of Diageos shares in the business. Guinness Nigeria Plc is the foremost total beverage alcohol company in Nigeria and a subsidiary of Diageo Plc. in the United Kingdom . The company was incorporated in Nigeria in 1963. Diageo Plc produces alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks such as Harp, Guinness, Johnnie Walker, Baileys, Smirnoff, Gordons Dry Gin, Satzenbrau, Dubic Malt, Malta Guinness, Orijin Non-alcoholic Zero, Orijin, and MrDowells. On June 11, the Internet was awash with reports that Guinness was leaving Nigeria. Several blogs and social media accounts cited the Peoples Gazette report, which headlined, Guinness to leave Nigeria after 75 years as Tinubus inflation wreaks economic havoc. The news channel also claimed that Guinness will join a long list of multinationals, like GlaxoSmithKline and Microsoft, that have left Nigeria, citing the harsh economic climate as making business unprofitable. The report reads: After operating in Nigeria since 1950 and enduring a torrid economic climate on the back of President Bola Tinubus administration, Guinness has announced it will exit the Nigerian market and sell off its controlling shares to Singaporean conglomerate Tolaram Group on Tuesday. Peoples Gazette Nigeria added that the brands loss between 2023 and 2024 may have forced Guinness parent company, Diageo, to sell its 58.02 per cent to a Singaporean group, Tolaram. Peoples Gazette reports that: The brewery brand recorded a staggering N61.9 billion loss after tax between July 2023 and March 2024, just a few months after Mr Tinubu floated the naira to unify the currencys value on the official and parallel foreign exchange markets. But the move backfired and caused many multinational companies to suffer huge financial setbacks, including Guinness Nigeria, whose N61.7 billion loss after tax in Q3 was a 1,000 per cent decrease from the N5.9 billion profit generated in the same period last year. The loss exacerbated by the nairas continued downward trend may have informed Diageo, Guinness parent company, to sell its 58.02 per cent majority stake to the Singaporean group. Peoples Gazette claimed that Guinness said the firm would leave Nigeria next year and hand over to a third-party venture. Several blogs and social media accounts, such as Gossipmilltv , Linda Ikeji Blog , and Nairaland , have similar narratives. Others can be found here , here , and here . The news that Guinness was leaving Nigeria has also been circulated on WhatsApp. DUBAWA visited Guinness Nigerias website and retrieved a press release dated June 11, 2024, with the headline Tolaram to acquire Diageos shareholding in Guinness Nigeria PLC. The statement did not indicate that Guinness is leaving Nigeria. Still, it stated that Tolaram was set to acquire 58.02% of Dieageos shareholding in Guinness, Nigeria, to continue producing the brand and its locally manufactured Diageo ready-to-drink and mainstream spirits brands. The statement reads in part: Under the terms of an agreement signed today, 11 June 2024, Tolaram will acquire Diageos 58.02% shareholding in Guinness Nigeria and enter into long-term license and royalty agreements for the continued production of the Guinness brand and its locally manufactured Diageo ready-to-drink and mainstream spirits brands. The transaction is expected to be completed during Fiscal 2025, subject to obtaining the requisite regulatory approvals in Nigeria. Diageo remains deeply committed to Nigeria and will retain ownership of the Guinness brand, which will be licensed to Guinness Nigeria for the long-term, enabling the next phase of growth and development of Guinness Nigeria under the stewardship of Tolaram. In partnership with Guinness Nigeria and Tolaram, Diageo will continue to drive the brand and marketing strategy for Guinness in Nigeria to ensure Diageos exceptional capabilities in brand building and innovation continue to drive long-term growth for Guinness in Nigeria. In a statement through Bayo Onanuga, President Bola Tinubus Special Adviser on Information and Strategy, the President praised the Tolaram Group for its confidence in Nigerias economy and assured that his government is committed to creating a conducive and transparent operating environment. The statement states , Tolaram will also enter into long-term license and royalty agreements for the continued production of the Guinness products and its locally manufactured Diageo ready-to-drink and mainstream brands. The statements from Guinness Nigeria and Bayo Onanuga confirmed that Guinness is not leaving the country, but Tolaram Group only bought 58.02% of Diageos shares in the business. Against the claim that the company is leaving Nigeria due to the harsh economic environment, its websites April 25 press release shows that its revenue surged by 28% in its unaudited financial results for the nine months ending March 31, 2024. The statement states, In a year marked by unprecedented challenges, Guinness Nigeria delivered a commendable 28% year-on-year revenue growth, reaching 220.3 billion compared to 172.47 billion in the same period last year. This notable surge was particularly pronounced in Q3, with a remarkable 44% acceleration, signifying a strategic pivot amidst evolving market dynamics. Despite grappling with soaring inflation rates, currency devaluation, and escalating food insecurity, Guinness Nigeria demonstrated remarkable resilience, leveraging proactive pricing strategies and optimised product offerings, focusing on premium categories to sustain growth momentum. The claim that Guinness is leaving Nigeria due to a harsh economy is false. Tolaram Group only bought 58.02% of Diageos shares in Guinness Nigeria.

"CLAIM: A supposed front page of a popular newspaper in Sierra Leone, AYV Newspaper, has gone viral with a banner headline Inter-Religious Council congratulates President-Elect Dr. Samura M Kamara. The headline story is part of the June 26 edition of the Africa Young Voices Newspaper (AYV-News). DUBAWAs check on the viral content shows that the viral front page newspaper had been doctored, as seen in the newspapers original copy below. Also, the Head of Programs at the Africa Young Voices Media Empire Mr Samuel Wise-Bangura , in the AYVs popular Good Morning Salone show on Monday, 26 June 2023 , vehemently dissociated their institution from the doctored newspaper. Additionally, the management of the Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone (IRCSL) has on Monday, June 26, 2023, equally published a statement signed and stamped by the Councils Secretary General and President, Rev.

"Claim: A Twitter user quoted presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, as saying he will rather everyone starve than to borrow for consumption Our findings show presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, said he would rather everyone starve than borrow for consumption. Peter Obi, a former governor, is seeking to become Nigerias president under the flagship of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He was the vice presidential candidate of the party in the 2019 general elections. Recently, a Twitter user, Jack (@Jack_ng01), shared a post with the claim that Peter Obi said he would rather people starve than borrow for consumption. Under my watch not a Kobo will be borrowed for consumption, instead we all starve, he was quoted as saying. The user attached to his post a screenshot of a video on Arise News where this claim was said to have been made by the aspirant. Other users took to the comment to share their opinion. A user named Comcombility (@ A_zhed ) noted that no country exists without borrowing. He has also said no country exists without borrowing and in fact, Nigeria can still borrow more. However, what is most important is what borrowed funds are used for, he tweeted. Another user Austyno (@ AustynoUsh ) noted that the quote extracted didnt do justice to the point the aspirant made. You make it look like he would starve people but he was actually coming from somewhere, @AustynoUsh commented. Francis Eze (@ francisneze ) questioning the rationale of borrowing to eat said the aspirant is not against borrowing but borrowing for consumption. Hes not against borrowing. But hes against borrowing for consumption. Do you borrow money from people to just eat? How do you pay them back after using it to eat? Did Peter Obi actually say this or was he taken out of context as suggested by some in the comments section? We searched and found the original video shared on Arise News. This video with the caption we need someone to get us out of this (APC) Peter Obi had 110,000 views as of Tuesday, April, 19, 2022. Watching the 38 minutes 15 seconds video, we observed that around 13 minutes to 16 minutes into the video, Mr Obi spoke on borrowing for consumption when asked if everything was okay with Nigerias debt status. Let us be specific about what we are borrowing; he asked me a question, what will you do? I will do it differently. Nigerians will know the reasons for borrowing and it must be borrowed for production. Nobody will spend a kobo or a dollar of borrowed money for consumption, instead we will all starve. That is why I told everybody there is nothing to share again, we must rebuild this country for the future of our children. Our findings show the claim that presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, said he would rather everyone starve than borrow for consumption is true. The aspirant made this comment to emphasise his opposition against borrowing for consumption, which he believes is not good for the economy.",1
"Claim: No country in the world has birthright citizenship, an Instagram user asserts. Verdict: False. Findings show Mexico and many other countries around the world have birthright citizenship. Following his January 20 inauguration as the 47th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump issued many executive orders. One of them is seeking to overturn birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship, also called jus soli, is a governmental policy under which any child born within a countrys borders or territory is automatically granted citizenship in that countryeven if their parents are not citizens. Like others, this order has been met without sharp criticism from Americans and non-Americans. Just a day after the Presidents order, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that 18 states in the U.S. sued the Trump administration over the executive order seeking to overturn citizenship by birth. Reacting to the news agencys Instagram publication, Raymond020954 , an Instagram user urged people to stop the criticism because no country in the world has birthright citizenship. A screenshot of Raymonds comment. The CBS publication received 8,578k reactions and 772 comments, while Raymonds comment received 108 reactions as of this report. Given the different reactions that Raymonds comment sparked, DUBAWA verified the truthfulness of the claim. DUBAWA searched The World Facts-book, a U.S. government publication, and found that Brazil, Cuba, The Gambia, Jamaica, Mexico, Mauritius, and Pakistan are countries with birthright citizenship, apart from the United States of America. For example, h ere and here list countries that have birthright citizenship. The Instagram users claim that no country has birthright citizenship is false.",1
"Claim: X user shared a picture of a royal family in Uba-Agwa in Oguta Local Government Area, arrested for robbery and kidnapping. Verdict: Misleading! Multiple news platforms reported the original incident in August 2020, using the same photograph in the recent post. Tribalism remains a deeply rooted issue in Nigeria, influencing social interactions, political decisions, and resource access. With over 250 ethnic groups, the countrys rich diversity, which is a source of cultural pride, has also given rise to prejudices and stereotypes, which continue to stoke divisions and tension. An X user, Pst Okezie (@Onsugbo), shared a picture of the arrest of an Igbo monarch from Uba-Agwa in Oguta LGA, along with his wife, cousin, pastor, and 30 others on charges of robbery and kidnapping. The picture shared shows the monarch sitting on the floor alongside other people during a parade by the police. The picture, posted on Oct. 14, 2024, has attracted significant attention, amassing 52,200 views. It has also sparked considerable engagement, with 129 comments, 207 reposts, 412 likes, and 40 bookmarks. The post can also be found on Facebook here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Given the posts virality, public interest, and the involvement of notable personalities, DUBAWA decided to verify. A keyword search revealed that the news dates back to 2020. An article by PM NewsNigeria dated Aug. 3, 2020, with the same picture, had the headline Imo chief Eze Okuegbunuwa, dad & two sons arrested for kidnapping. The news report noted that the monarchs gang had kidnapped Louis Obodo at Mgbala Agwa in Oguta LGA on Jul. 19, 2020, after the police gave them a hot chase. The 59-year-old ruler of Obor Community was paraded along with 30 other suspects who allegedly committed various crimes ranging from robbery, kidnapping and rape. We found other reports of the same development with the same date in The Nation , The Street Journal, and The View Point . TinEye , a widely used image verification tool known for tracking the origins and circulation of images across the Internet, indicates that the photograph in question first appeared online in 2020. This discovery establishes that the post is not new but recirculated recently to mislead the public. The claim about the arrest of an Igbo monarch with his family and others for robbery and kidnapping is misleading. Our investigation confirms that the image and accompanying story are not recent but date back to 2020.",0
"Claim: Nigerias Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, recently claimed that the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo spent between 300 million and 400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, and alleged that the equipment purchased is nowhere to be found. There is insufficient data to validate this claim by the Minister. On Thursday the 10th of June 2021, Nigeria officially launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, also known as the Deep Blue Project. The project displays some of the $195 million of equipment with the primary objective of securing Nigerian waters along the Gulf of Guinea and the countrys oil infrastructure with a coordinated combination of land, sea, and air forces. According to a statement by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Nigerias Maritime Security Unit (MSU) of the Deep Blue Project, comprised personnel from the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police, and Department of State Services, and their goal was to demonstrate their preparedness for full deployment to fight the ongoing menace of piracy, mostly emerging from the Nigerias Niger Delta region. It was during the official inauguration of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure in Nigeria (also called the Deep Blue Project) at the ENL Terminal, Apapa Port, Lagos, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, alleged that President Olusegun Obasanjo administration spent between 300 million and 400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, but that the equipment so allegedly purchased disappeared. He said: This war, under President Obasanjo; they spent between 300 million and 400 million to buy the same equipment we have bought and they have disappeared. The Deep Blue Project (DBP) was first initiated in 2017 by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. One of the first steps involved the Nigerian Government approving a maritime security contract with Israeli firm HLSI Security Systems and Technologies Limited for asset procurement and leasing. In 2020, Amaechi requested further funds to hire fast intercept vessels for one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19. In total, Nigeria has allocated a tenth of its defence budget to the DBP and is expected to deploy an increased range of assets to tackle maritime insecurity including two Special Mission Vessels, seventeen Fast Interceptor Boats, two Special Mission Aircraft, three helicopters, four unmanned aerial vehicles and sixteen armoured vehicles. Furthermore, to bolster intelligence gathering and sharing efforts, a command, control, computer communication and information centre (C4i) has also been set up in Kirikiri, Lagos. In a March 29 2021 article, Swim together or sink alone: African states unite to confront pirate threat writer Shola Lawal reported that Nigerias Deep Blue Project (DBP), launched this year, is cautiously inspiring hope. The ambitious $195 million project aims to purchase assets like fast-intervention vessels, build interagency command centers for the countrys naval and port authorities, and train security forces. Chijioke Alozie reports in his seminal paper, Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy in Nigeria, the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea that the first serious effort in this area by any administration in Nigeria was when then President Yar Adua (2007-2010) appointed a Federal Minister of Niger Delta region to provide oversight into projects and peoples complaints, and above all, to be the Federal Governments presence in the region. Successive governments have followed the historic pace set by YarAdua, by the appointment of a Federal Minister of Niger Delta. There is no record of purchase of any security hardware but efforts were essentially directed at pacifying the militants at the time. But in an attempt to fight maritime piracy, the government, in August 2014, appointed a one-time Niger-Delta warlord from Bayelsa State, General Boyloaf, as leader of a maritime security outfit in his home state of Bayelsa. It is worth remembering that Boyloaf once led an aggressive attack on a Shell oil platform 120 km (74 miles) offshore. In 2014 Boyloaf was quoted to have said, the government was having serious security challenges in the creeks. They chose me to deal with it as the creeks are my terrain. I was born in the creeks, I fought against the government in the creeks, and I will now use that knowledge to hunt the pirates. In all our investigation into the claim made by Mr Rotimi Amaechi, the Transportation Minister, there was no available record or document to indicate that the Obasanjo administration purchased security or military equipment to combat piracy on the Gulf of Guinea other than the October 2005 setting up of a Naval Base in Bonny. In all our findings, there was no budgetary allocation for the specific purpose of purchasing equipment, let alone a mention of spending of between 300 million and 400. Attempts were made to get Mr Amaechi to substantiate his claim with evidence. Text message sent to his phone number was not replied and repeated calls to the line were not answered. This writer also sent an email to the minister but got no response. There is no sufficient record to back the claim by Minister Rotimi Amaechi that the Obasanjo administration spent between 300 million and 400 million to buy equipment for safeguarding the maritime sector.

"Claim: An X user, ( @PO_GrassRootM ) Peter Obi Grassroots Mobilization claimed that a dozen presidential guards were arrested in Burkina Faso due to an attempted assassination on its president, Captain Ibrahim Traore. Verdict: False. A check on the official website of the Burkinabe government did not contain any information on presidential guards arrested about any recent assassination. Also, a Google keyword search did not reveal any media report on the arrest of presidential guards in May. Over the years, the West African region has witnessed a surge in coups to topple elected governments. While some have been successive, others have failed. Most coups on the continent are caused by corruption, insecurity, and suffering of the masses . The new military leaders often find it hard to rein in the effect of their ascension to power. Burkina Faso has been prone to coup detat. Its current leader, Captain Ibrahim Traore, ascended to power through a coup, while his predecessor also took the same route . Since the coup that brought Traore to power on Sep 30, 2022, his government has announced a series of unsuccessful coup attempts, the latest being in January 2024, according to media reports. However, an X user, @PO_GrassRootM , claimed there was another assassination attempt in May, which led to the arrest of dozens of presidential guards. The tweet reads, JUST IN: More than a dozen presidential guards have been arrested in connection with an assassination attempt on the President of Burkina Faso, Captain Ibrahim Traore. It was posted on May 20, 2024, and has garnered 128,700 Views with 177 comments, 632 retweets, and 2,200 likes. The tweet did not state when the incident occurred, but a Google search brought up a tweet by @Dachronica (Les Misrables), which stated that the incident happened on the evening of May 19, 2024. The account also claimed that the incident was the ninth assassination attempt on the president, which he has survived. The X post further linked Traore to the reincarnation of Burkina Fasos Revolutionary leader, Thomas Sankara; thus, the coloniser of the country (France) is agonising over finding another Blaise Compaore to remind us that history revolves around crimes. it said. With the rise in coordinated misinformation portraying Captain Traore as the new African revolutionary, Thomas Sankara, DUBAWA, decided to investigate this claim. We conducted a Google word search using the statement presidential guard arrested for an attempted coup in Burkina Faso . The results were mostly from media reports of a failed coup in September 2023, in which the government said four people were arrested after it thwarted a coup attempt. One of the reports by Al Jazeera quoted a spokesperson for the ruling military, Rimtalba Jean Emmanuel Ouedraogo, saying some officers were caught in an attempt to destabilise the country, while some were sought as they planned to seize power and plunged the country into chaos. A further check on the governments website, Information Service of the Government of Burkina Faso , where information on previous coup attempts was posted , did not contain any press release or document that mentioned the arrest of presidential guards on May 19, 2024. Similarly, Radio Tlvision du Burkina, the countrys national broadcaster, does not mention such an incident. The claim that a dozen presidential guards were arrested in Burkina Faso for planning to assassinate Burkina Fasos president is false. This report is produced for the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame Karikari Fact-Checking Fellowship in partnership with Daily Trust Newspaper to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in Nigeria.",0
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp voice note making the rounds had announced the death of the national leader of the All Progressives Congress, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Bola Tinubu is not dead. He was only out of the country and had already returned on Tuesday night. On Tuesday, June 15, 2021, a WhatsApp voice note started circulating. In the short clip, a voice could be heard saying Tinubu has died. According to the audio clip, Tinubu died at a hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. The speaker, who appeared to be one of those agitating for secession, was also heard congratulating his listeners that one of their enemies had died. He also mentioned other prominent Nigerian leaders that could possibly die in a few months to come. The unidentified speaker said in Yoruba, Good morning everyone, I am happy to announce to you that our enemies are gradually dying. God has taken the life of one of the people disturbing Yoruba land. Tinubu is dead, he died in Dubai, thats the news I got just now. We are overcoming our enemies, the curses are working, Tinubu just died in Dubai now. We will surely overcome all our enemies. We will get to the promised land, they will die one after the other, those left are Obasanjo and those kings. The audio has sparked wide speculations on social media over the rumoured death of the politician who just celebrated his 69th birthday barely three months ago on March 28. Social media users on Facebook and Twitter have also shared reports of Tinubus death as the information keeps spreading like wildfire. It was observed that handlers of social media accounts with the tag Biafra rejoiced at the news. Another Facebook user converted the audio clip obtained that initially propagated the news and converted it into audio. Dubawa placed a call across to Tunde Rahman, the media aide to Tinubu, who confirmed that his boss just arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday night with pictures attached. He, however, did not state which country Tinubu arrived from and the reason for his travel. Also, credible national media organisations debunked the news stating that Tinubu was expected back to Lagos by Tuesday. The viral claim that Bola Tinubu is dead is false as he just returned from France on Tuesday evening. He only travelled out of the country for a while.

"Claim: Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Lahai Leema beaten up by an OSD guard because of his girlfriend. From the analysis done on the images using the Google Reverse Image tool and its glaring explanation of the origin of the photos plus video evidence of the fighting claim clearly states that incidents are not connected to Sierra Leone and the Internal Affairs Minister. It is therefore a false and misguided claim. An image circulating on Facebook claims Sierra Leones Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Lahai Lawrence Leema was beaten up by an OSD Police officer over a woman. The claim has two other images attached with one depicting a disfigured face of someone that has been severely beaten and punched with one of the eyes completely closed as a result of punches and the other attached photo shows two unrecognizable men fighting on a street and believed to be the incident between the OSD and the Minister. The statement added to the post in Krio translates in English as Leema you know very well your legs are not strong, now look at the damage that has been caused to your face by the OSD guard. As three images purports to be the minister of Internal Affairs in Sierra Leone- with one having the original photo of the Minister and others supporting the claim of an altercation and its outcome, Dubawa decided to have a verification done on the said claims to ascertain its veracity. The reverse image search was used and it identified the image with the punched face with that of Joshua Robinson . Joshua Robinson was an African American that was brutally manhandled by the US Police and severely beaten for allegedly breaking traffic rules in 2013. The image of his brutalized face after the assault in 2013 flooded the internet as it was a case of police brutality and Google Reverse was able to keep hold of it. This is the image that was attached to the post claiming it is that of Sierra Leones Deputy Internal Affairs Minister. The third image that shows two grown men fighting on a street according to Reverse Search happened somewhere in Nigeria as you can hear Yoruba from the background and Yoruba is not one of our local dialects in Sierra Leone; clearly stating that the photo was not taken here and the video of the fight from which the image was screenshot clearly exposes the face of the two men of which none is our Deputy Internal Affairs Minister of Sierra Leone. From the analysis done on the images using the Google Reverse Image tool and its glaring explanation of the origin of the photos plus video evidence of the fighting claim clearly states that incidents are not connected to Sierra Leone and the Internal Affairs Minister. It is therefore a false and misguided claim.",0
"The information ecosystem has never been free from manipulation or distortion by various actors, be they individual, state, or organisation actors. Dis/misinformation actors use different strategies to influence people and stir them to action to achieve their aims. One popular strategy is using the names of prominent people with a reputation, like political leaders, religious leaders, and scholars, to convince the public. Presidents of different countries have found their names in such content and will continue to do so as long these actors try to give their agenda credibility. Here are some notable times that the name of Nigerias president, Bola Tinubu, was found in mis/disinforming content to convince the public. Ahead of President Bola Tinubus ceremony in May 2023, a WhatsApp message went viral claiming the president was dolling out N20,000 to Nigerians to thank them for voting for him. We found this to be false because the link attached to the message for redeeming the price led to a website showing different characteristics likened to that of Ponzi schemes or fraudulent websites. The presidency also distanced itself from the said fund. Months after President Tinubus inauguration, the screenshot of a news report claiming that he had reduced the monthly allowance received by corp members in the country from N33,000 during the previous administration in 2020 to N25,000 went viral. We discovered that the viral image had the watermark breakyourownnews.com, which indicates a website where users can alter a news article for mischievous purposes. Also, a close look at the presidents inaugural speech showed no mention or reference to allowance reduction for corp members. In the follow-up of the general election, which President Bola Tinubu won , the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, expressed dissatisfaction with the electoral process and contested the verdict of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). While this case was with the election tribunal pending judgment, the Facebook page of an online magazine, Igbotimesmagazine, shared an article alleging that President Bola Tinubu had ordered the suspension of all courts in charge of the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) over fear of his disqualification. However, our findings revealed this was false as no credible news outlet reported it. The online magazine had also been notorious for sharing false and misleading reports around elections . In Sept. 2023, a video showing Arise TV reporter Oji Okpe announcing that Mr Tinubu had abolished the use of the Naira and adopted the use of dollars emerged. The 25-second video showed President Tinubu saying, We are planning to abolish the usage of Naira and start using dollars. Our investigation revealed the video had been manipulated, and the original version was from a press conference in 2022, where Mr Tinubu announced his intention to run for the presidency. A disclaimer by Arise News also debunked the video.",1
"Claim: An Instagram user posted that eating cucumber, onions, and tomatoes prevents and treats prostate cancer and diabetes. Verdict: While cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes are nutritious and can be part of a healthy diet, relying solely on them to prevent prostate cancer or diabetes is misleading. Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland, a walnut-sized organ in men that produces semen. While many prostate cancers grow slowly and may not cause harm, others are aggressive and can spread rapidly. Early detection through regular screenings is crucial for successful treatment. Diabetes , on the other hand, is a chronic condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. This happens because your body either doesnt produce enough insulin, a hormone that helps glucose (sugar) get into your cells, or cant effectively use the insulin it does produce. There are two main types of diabetes ie Type 1 and type 2. Both prostate cancer and diabetes can lead to serious health problems , and over the years, there have been controversies about remedies for preventing cancer and diabetes. On July 6, 2024, an Instagram user, @ nwokoronetwork, claimed in a video post that eating cucumber, onions, and tomatoes prevents and treats prostate cancer and diabetes Excerpts from the video reads: If you are a man, and your father suffered from prostate cancer, or you are coming from a family of diabetic persons or high blood pressure, you need these things Im chewing now. He then goes on to eat the cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes, demonstrating that they are to be eaten raw. He further emphasises that they can be blended before consumption, although he recommends chewing them raw to keep the fibre content as whole as possible. He further said: If you are able to eat this, even if its three times a week, you wont talk of the prostate in your life, no matter the type of prostate, because the tomato alone will cure you. Even if you dont have them, why not use them to prevent it? I have used these (Tomatoes, Onion, and Cucumber) to cure someone, As of August 14, 2024, the post had generated over 12,800 likes, over 560 comments, and over 480 shares on Instagram. It has also generated other conversations and reactions from the platform users, who expressed support, disbelief, and scepticism at the post. An Instagram user, @haywood.gerst, wrote, Wow!!! This looks interesting. Im going to start this immediately Another user, @albert.justin.1422, wrote, Thank you. What amount should be used? How many onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers? E xpressing scepticism, @steveuyi posted, Everyone is a doctor these days. Having observed the controversial reactions and engagement generated by the post, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claims made. There is no conclusive evidence that cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes prevent and treat prostate cancer and diabetes. While these foods are undoubtedly beneficial for overall health, the claim that they can prevent prostate cancer and diabetes is a bit oversimplified. Tomatoes: Healthline opines that tomatoes are rich in lycopene , an antioxidant linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer. Cooked tomatoes, like in tomato sauce, actually increase lycopene absorption. Tomatoes are all good sources of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These nutrients can help protect your cells from damage and may help reduce your risk of certain chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. However, no scientific evidence suggests that these vegetables can prevent prostate cancer or diabetes. While some studies suggest a potential link between tomato consumption and reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, more research is needed. Onions Onions contain antioxidants that may contribute to overall health, including heart health. According to a study carried out to determine the potential effect of onion extract on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and acid phosphatase (AP) in Wistar rats, the relevance of onions in prostate cancer is very scarce in literature as well as the mechanism in which it works. While some studies hint at a possible connection between onion consumption and lower diabetes risk, evidence is still inconclusive. Hence, theres limited research specifically linking onions to prostate cancer prevention. Cucumbers Cucumbers are low in calories and water content, making them a healthy choice. Populations that consume high amounts of allium vegetables have been reported to have a lower rate of overall cancer.6-9. A study by the University of San Francisco states that More research is necessary for a formal recommendation regarding their effects on the risk of prostate cancer. Still, evidence suggests regular consumption of these vegetables benefits overall health. Corroborating the aforementioned studies and also discrediting the one-size-fits-all approach, Dr Abdulrasheed Tijani, a consultant public health physician, said: Prostate disease isnt treated by all that he said. However, eating fruits and vegetables is encouraged and helps the body, but it doesnt mean it is a cure for prostate cancer. The effect of dietary antioxidants on prostate cancer remains undefined and inconclusive, with different antioxidants affecting prostate cancer risk differentially. Further studies are needed and ongoing to clarify the relationship between antioxidants found in some foods and vegetables and how they relate to prostate cancer risk and delineate the underlying mechanisms. Dr Ahmed Olalekan, a trained doctor with Highland Hospital Ibadan, said: Chewing or eating cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes is not curative of prostate cancers. It also has no curative effect on diabetes please. This video is unfounded and should be ignored, as there are no conclusive studies to that effect. Further discouraging the postulations in the video, Dr Azariah Lawal, a trained US medical practitioner who works in the healthcare field, said: These claims are misleading and dangerous. If someone sees it and doesnt take it at entertainment value, then it becomes a problem. In some cases, you cant just eat raw onions; what if there are toxins in the tomatoes or onions? You dont just come out and make claims about diseases or the human body because the human body is an amazing machine. For some people, there are drawbacks to eating onions, such as heartburn. Eating raw onions may cause or worsen pain and irritation in the stomach. Onions can aggravate irritable bowel syndrome symptoms, including bloating, passing gas, and stomach pains in others. This is especially true when you eat onions raw. Some people may be allergic to onions and experience common symptoms like itchiness, runny nose, red eyes, nasal congestion, or a rash when eating onions. So theres no one-size-fits-all approach to this. While cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes are nutritious and can be part of a healthy diet, relying solely on them to prevent prostate cancer or diabetes is misleading. These conditions are complex and influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and overall diet. Its essential to consult a healthcare professional for personalised advice on preventing prostate cancer and diabetes.

"Claim : OPay agents protest over missing funds. Verdict : The circulated protest video featuring OPay agents is from 2021. OPay asserts that the allegations have been addressed, rendering the claim misleading. In the early days of Oct. 2023, a protest video of OPay agents began to go viral on the internet. After some money suddenly disappeared from their accounts on a Sunday night, the group complained. The complaint footage has been extensively shared on Facebook and WhatsApp, accompanied by cautions to customers to exercise vigilance by transferring their funds to alternative banks. OPay is a mobile platform catering to needs such as payments, transfers, loans, savings, and essential services for individuals. At present, OPay boasts over 35 million registered app users and a network of 500,000 agents in Nigeria. The viral video had different captions, including Scam alert, beware and another OPAY, please listen to this, for those using Opay account. Due to the delicate nature of the assertion and the public unrest it could cause, DUBAWA opted to investigate it. DUBAWA observed that the video had emanated from TVC News. Therefore, we conducted some keyword searches and found an Aug. 23, 2021, video on TVCs YouTube channel titled OPAY Agents Protest Unauthorised Fund Withdrawal, Demand Urgent Intervention. According to the protesters, they woke up to their accounts emptied by unknown fraudsters. Although they had filed complaints with the company, nothing seemed to have been done about the missing monies, hence the protest. Furthermore, we checked the official Facebook page of OPay. We found a disclaimer where the bank debunked the recent claim and clarified that the missing funds allegations were a 2021 occurrence and have been resolved in collaboration with relevant stakeholders. It further reassured customers of the safety of their funds in the statement. The protest video featuring OPay agents in circulation dates back to 2021. According to OPay, the allegations have been resolved. The claim is misleading.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user, Esli Holder, posted an image to a private group claiming a 23-year-old Morris Watson impregnated his sister, Ha nnah Watson, in Rivercess County. Verdict : False. Our findings reveal the duo are a couple not siblings. A renowned Liberian Journalist in Rivercess, Eric Doue, informed DUBAWA that no such incident occurred in the area. Esli Holder, a content creator, posted in a private group (Discussing Liberia) that a 23-year-old boy in Rivercess County impregnated his biological sister. According to the poster, 17-year-old Hannah Watson had just given birth to her brother, Morris Watson. 23-year-old Morris Watson impregnated his 17-year-old biological sister Hannah Watson in Rivercess County, the poster said. Screenshot of the Facebook post. The post generated 40 reactions and 90 comments at the time of this writing. Screenshot of the comment section. In the comments, users shared mixed reactions to the situation. Some expressed utter disapproval of the alleged action by the 23-year-old. Others sympathised with the teenage girl. The mixed responses led DUBAWA to initiate a fact-check. DUBAWA contacted a renowned journalist in Rivercess, Eric Doue, to determine whether such an incident occurred. Mr Doue told the researcher that the allegation was false and no such incident had been reported recently in the area. Also, DUBAWA contacted the claimant via messenger to provide further evidence of his claim but didnt get a response.We then conducted a Google Reverse Image Search to identify the source of the image. Our search found that the image was first posted by a content creator, Ekuma Leonard, on Facebook, congratulating the alleged couple without further explanation. The image was uploaded on August 26, 2024, by Ekuma.The photo was also posted by Somvik Music Vibes and Ekenes blog on Instagram with no suggestion that the couple were siblings. Again , the researcher found that the picture had been posted on multiple platforms, as captured by Google Lens, with no suggestion that the couple are siblings. According to DUBAWAs findings, such an incident didnt occur in Rivercess. Esli Holders claim is false.",1
"Several posts on Facebook claim that OPay is giving away N150,000 grants to its customers in Nigeria. OPay is a Nigeria-based mobile bank. One post, dated 28 July 2024, reads : 150,000 grant by OPay. Offer is ending this week. It also encourages users to apply via the link attached. The same claim has been posted here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But is this true? We checked. Engagement bait scam Africa Check searched for news of the company giving away N150,000 grants, but came up empty. This is a red flag, as such a claim would have made headlines if true. The link in the posts took us to a blog post about U.S Visa Sponsorship Opportunities. We found it suspicious that the link didn't take users to the OPay website where they could apply for the grant. This is another indication that the grant doesn't exist. Such posts are a classic example of engagement bait . They encourage users to like, comment or share, boosting the post's reach without offering any reward. They also drive traffic to the website about visas, potentially increasing advertising revenue. We scoured OPays social media pages, including Facebook and X , and found that it had never offered grants to its customers. OPay has also warned its customers not to click on suspicious links , share their one-time passwords or answer any calls, emails or text messages asking for personal information. They also asked their customers to report fraudulent or suspicious activities. To protect yourself, read our guide on how to spot scams on Facebook.

"Claim: A mermaid was spotted celebrating its birthday at a beach in Akwa Ibom. Verdict: FALSE. The mermaid images are from a Facebook users birthday photoshoot in 2020. In Nigeria, mermaids, otherwise known as Mami Wata, are renowned for their seductive beauty and mysterious existence. They are also identified as marine spirits and goddesses of fertility. A Facebook channel, Igbere TV IGTV , posted images of a mermaid allegedly spotted celebrating its birthday at a beach in Akwa Ibom. Beautiful Mermaid Spotted Celebrating Birthday at the Beach in Awka Ibom, the posts caption reads. As of Friday, September 8, 2023, the post has had 618 reactions, 319 comments and 37 shares. While many users dismissed the posts genuineness, a few accepted it as real. Wow! (B)eautiful, Israel Nwosu commented . I was there (live) and have the video, attested Jeremiah Chijioke. Mermaids are considered mysterious. However, some people believing the post was real necessitated our fact-check. We first observed the wrong spelling of Akwa Ibom as Awka Ibom, so we decided to do a keyword search and found that Nairaland had posted a similar story. The popular news blog site announced that a lady identified as Happiness Enekak was causing a stir online for identifying as a mermaid. Nairaland further detailed that the lady had posted the photos in an Akwa Ibom state-based Facebook group called Ibom Crush. We then looked up the ladys handle on Facebook and discovered that she had posted a similar photo on her platform. She made the post on November 28, 2020 . Announcing her birthday, she called herself Jane Bond, a character whom she labels as a mermaid and whose mind swims at a depth most would (drown) in We noticed she acknowledged the studio she had hired to take the photographs as Dove Studio. Additionally, we discovered that it wasnt the first time the lady had visited the location for a photoshoot . The claim is false. The photos arent images of a mermaid but a birthday photoshoot of a lady, taken in 2020.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user shared an image claiming it depicts Nigerian hackers recently arrested as part of a major police operation involving 113 foreign nationals suspected of cyber fraud in Nigeria. Verdict: Misleading. The image does not show suspects from the recent operation in Nigeria. DUBAWA traced the image to a 2022 report detailing the arrest of a Nigerian scammer in India, not Nigeria. Nigeria continues to battle cyber fraud, as many youths turn to get-rich-quick schemes involving online theft. In response, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has actively been on the lookout, arresting those identifying as Yahoo boys. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ( NDLEA ) has also apprehended suspected fraudsters during their operations. This issue has extended internationally, affecting Nigerias reputation. Recurrent cyber fraud cases involving foreign nationals have created a negative perception of Nigeria abroad. Unfortunately, this image has impacted Nigerians, complicating international relations and travel. On Nov. 3, 2024, the Nigeria Police Force executed a major operation leading to the arrest of 130 individuals suspected of cyber fraud and hacking. Among those detained were 113 foreign nationals, predominantly Chinese and Malaysian, and 17 Nigerians. This operation took place in a building in Abuja. Following this, on Nov. 11, 2024, a Facebook user, @FunmiStella , posted a summary of the recent arrest of foreigners in Nigeria on charges of cyber fraud. Alongside the post, the user shared an image showing ten men with packaged phones in front of them, captioned Nigerian Hacker arrested. While the post hadnt attracted much engagement when reviewed, the image stood out due to discrepancies. It showed fewer individuals than the 130 arrested, and the men did not appear to match the profiles of the predominantly Chinese and Malaysian suspects involved in the operation. These inconsistencies prompted DUBAWA to make additional investigations, anticipating that the post could gain traction and potentially mislead viewers. Starting with media platforms that had reported the arrests, DUBAWA checked these outlets but could not find any image that matched the one used in the Facebook users post. See detailed reports here , here , and here . We then analysed the image using Google Lens, which traced the image back to an article published on The 420 platform on April 1, 2022. This report detailed the arrest of a Nigerian national, Paul Churchill, by cybercrime police in Uttar Pradesh, India. Churchill was apprehended for defrauding women on popular matrimony websites such as Shaadi.com and Jeevansaathi.com. Posing as a successful bachelor named Yogendra Jain, he used fake profiles to deceive individuals searching for marital partners. In one instance from February 2022, a woman from Noida reported being scammed after Churchill claimed hed visit India to meet her family but was detained at the airport with unaccounted cash. An accomplice, pretending to be an airport official, pressured her to transfer Rs 1.07 lakh to facilitate his release. Police tracked Paul Churchills activities through digital records, ultimately locating him in Delhi. Investigators found that he used fake SIM cards and forged documents to create multiple accounts, complicating detection. Churchill reportedly acquired his hacking skills from online tutorials and books and is believed to have amassed over Rs 57 lakh through various fraud schemes. His arrest has prompted Noida police to investigate potential accomplices and explore connections to a broader network of Nigerian gangs involved in cyber scams across India. The image shared on Facebook with reports of the recent arrest of 113 foreign cyber fraudsters is unrelated to the incident. DUBAWA traced it back to a 2022 report about a Nigerian scammer arrested in India.",0
"Claim: The bacteria in yoghurt is the same as the one in the vagina. Verdict: FALSE. Although the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina may have some similarities, they are different. Yoghurt, the creamy and tangy dairy delight, has been a staple in cuisines worldwide for centuries. Whether its enjoyed on its own, as a savoury dip, or as a refreshing topping for your favourite fruits and granola, yoghurt is a versatile and nutritious food that has something for everyone. Yoghurt is made by fermenting milk with live cultures of bacteria packed with probiotics that promote healthy digestion and boost the immune system. Its also a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential vitamins and minerals. People often wonder about two common types of bacteria found in yoghurt and those in the vagina. While both types of bacteria are important, are they the same? Recently on Twitter, in a post , temmie (@me_lanin_pie) asserted that the bacteria found in the vagina is the same in Yoghurt. The tweet reads, The bacteria found in yoghurt is the same bacteria found in the vagina. As of the time of filing this report, the tweet had a combination of retweets, likes, comments and views of over 742,000 engagements. DUBAWA thought it important to verify this because of the conflicting views about the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina, its virality and the sensitive nature of the issue concerning public health. According to an Oxford University Press on National Library publication , the word yoghourt is believed to have come from the Turkish word yourmak, which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. During references to the health-promoting properties of yoghurt date back to 6000 BC in Indian Ayurvedic scripts, it was not until the 20th century that Stamen Grigorov, a Bulgarian medical student, attributed the benefits to lactic acid bacteria. Bacteria play an essential role in our bodies, and we encounter different types of bacteria in various parts of our bodies. Medical News Today defines bacteria as microscopic, single-celled organisms that exist in their millions, in every environment, both inside and outside other organisms. Some bacteria are harmful, but most serve a useful purpose. They support many forms of life, both plant and animal and are used in industrial and medicinal processes. Yoghurt is a fermented milk product made by adding specific strains of bacteria to milk. It is made when heated milk is combined with bacteria and left to sit at a warm temperature for several hours. According to Simon Pedersen, a Food Scientist at Arla Foods, When we add bacteria to milk products, we refer to them as cultures and use those with a good reputation. They are called lactic acid bacteria or lactic acid cultures. These bacteria convert the lactose in milk into lactic acid, which causes the milk to thicken and develop its characteristic tangy taste. The two most common species of lactic acid bacteria used in yoghurt production are Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilous. On the other hand, the vagina contains a complex microbiome of different types of bacteria. The most dominant type of bacteria in a healthy vagina is the Lactobacillus species. These bacteria help maintain the vaginal pH, preventing the overgrowth of harmful bacteria that can lead to infections. The specific species of Lactobacillus present in the vagina include Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus gasseri, among others. In 2015 , Cecilia Westbrook, an MD/PhD student at the University of Wisconsin, made yoghurt using her vaginal bacteria. Rosanne Hertzberger, a Dutch microbiologist who studies vaginal bacteria at Washington University School of Medicine in the US, told ScienceAlert this was apparently not a good idea because our vaginas contain many of bad, as well as good, bacteria. The dominant bacteria in the vagina is Lactobacillus, similar to the bacteria used to make yoghurt. However, not all Lactobacillus strains can create yoghurt, and the yoghurt we buy at supermarkets is made from a combination of different bacterial strains. Ms Hertzberger replicated an experiment to make yoghurt using different Lactobacillus strains, but only one was remotely successful, producing sour milk with precipitated milk protein. Gregor Reid, a professor of microbiology at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, also disagrees with the experiment by Ms Westbrook. According to Mr Reid, it is improbable that the experiment conducted by the woman resulted in any health benefits. He said, if she was eating it to get the benefits of the lactobacillus, she already has plenty in her vagina, so that makes no sense. The bacteria used in yoghurt production are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture. According to a publication on Science Direct , the bacteria in the vagina are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining the vaginal environment. One of the most significant differences between the bacteria in yoghurt and the vagina is their location. Yoghurt bacteria are primarily found in the digestive system, whereas vaginal bacteria are found in the reproductive system. Additionally, yoghurt bacteria are not a natural body part, whereas vaginal bacteria are. Another important difference is the role they play in the body. While yoghurt bacteria can help promote digestive health, vaginal bacteria are essential for reproductive health. A health expert, Omale Ogbe, in an interview with DUBAWA, stated that the bacterias are not the same based on the taxonomy . They may be of the same genus, but they are not the same specie as can be seen here for bacteria found in the vagina (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus. jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasser) and here for yoghurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Mr Ogbe explained. While the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina may have some similarities, they are not the same. Yoghurt bacteria are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture, while vaginal bacteria are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining reproductive health.

"Claim: A photo making the rounds on the social media shows an organ trafficking alert purportedly issued by the Office on Drugs and Crime department of the United Organisations (UNODC) urging readers to beware of agents/companies offering them jobs abroad. No, this alert didnt originate from the UNODC; its only a mimicry of another publication on the departments website. Organ trafficking, under the broader spectrum of human trafficking and migrant smuggling, has remained a huge problem the United Nations, other international bodies and governments of various countries seek to tackle. The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, provides the sole internationally accepted definition of trafficking in persons. Article 3 (a) of the protocol stipulates that Trafficking in Persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of human organs. It has been identified that migrants seeking greener pastures in other countries but do not have the option to migrate legally form the majority of those who fall victim to these organ harvesters. Some victims are tricked or coerced into having their organs removed, UNODC says. Several programmes have been organised to curb the spread of this menace by educating the people on the need for a legal migration process. These programmes are handled by organizations such as the International Organization for Migration among others. Trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is not a new phenomenon. Over the years, the crime has received significant attention from media, NGOs, academia and also from international and regional actors. These include the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Being and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Also, in 2013, the UN Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions that inter alia request UNODC to collect and analyse information on trafficking in persons for organ removal and encourage Member States to provide to UNODC evidence-based data on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, including for the purpose of the removal of organs respectively. It has, however, remained a persistent problem, hence the focus. The international (transplant) community has developed standards and guidelines to govern transplantation, to regulate care for donors and thereby prevent organ-related crimes, including trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. Of particular relevance are the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation, as well as the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism. Particularly in Nigeria, the establishment of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on 14 July 2013 shows a concerted effort to put a stop to trafficking and consequently organ trafficking. The photo (pictured below) has been circulated on social media as an organ trafficking alert from the UNODC establishing the fact that there is a black market for human body parts. The alert highlighted the most valuable organs and listed the cost of each one in dollars. According to the alert, a kidney is said to cost $262,000 (N107, 813, 000); a heart goes for $119,000 (N48, 968, 500) and a liver $157,000 (N64, 605, 500). It reads, The black market for parts of the human body is booming in the Middle East. A kidney now costs 262,000 dollars (131 million CFA francs); the heart costs 119,000 dollars (60 million CFA francs) and the liver costs 157,000 dollars (79 million CFA francs). Beware of fake foreign agencies promising to make you work abroad. They process your papers, pay your plane ticket and just take you abroad pretending they want to find you a job, but instead, they kill their victims, recover all the precious parts of their bodies. Many people have been offered jobs in the Middle East and so far their families have been unable to locate them. Share to save lives. This has been shared on some websites and across social media platforms such as Nairaland , a blog and on Facebook . According to a global report from 2020, while still detected in small numbers, trafficking for the purpose of organ removal was reported in North Africa, South and South-East Asia, Central America and Europe during the reporting period. It indicated that in 2017, about 25 victims were reported, and in 2018, this number had risen to more than 40. Meanwhile, females comprised most of the victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and two-thirds of the victims were trafficked for forced labour. Most of the men were trafficked for organ removal. A link on the alert was entered and it brought out an error result. It is, however, observed that it is a mimicry of an archived link from UNODC. While the comments on the photo highlighted the prices of human organs in the black market noting that it is on the rise in the Middle East, the archived link from the UNODC states that desperate situations of recipients and donors of human organs create an avenue for exploitation by international organ trafficking syndicated. It also stated that victims of these crimes could be vulnerable by virtue of poverty. Dubawa also observed that the alert has previously been flagged by the AFP fact-check which stated that UNODC Pakistan had confirmed that the purported alert is fake. AFP quoted the regional branch of the UNODC as saying that the message does not originate from UNODC and contains out-of-date information that is not related to current UNODC activities. The photo had not originated from the United Nations as the body is yet to give a warning about a black market for human organs in the Middle East. Although there are efforts to curb the menace of organ trafficking by the organization, the Middle East was not one of the continents highlighted in past reports regarding this. Also, the UNODC is yet to give a cost for each vital human part.

"By: Elbie Sebleh & Jackson C. Clay, Jr. Claim: Martin K.N. Kollie said on Facebook, This is the largest centre in Grand Gedeh County, Zwedru Multilateral High School. It is still poor in terms of turnout up to now. Verdict: Misleading! The school shown in the photo shared by Marin Kollie is Diana E. Davies, located in District #17, Montserrado County. The head of research and rapid response of the Unity Party (UP), Martin K. N. Kollie , made a Facebook post suggesting poor turnout at one of the election precincts, Zwedru Multilateral High School in Grand Gedeh County. The post had over 190 comments, 40 shares, and 300 emojis. Grand Gedeh County is one of the fifteen counties of Liberia, and it is found in the southeastern part of Liberia, a place believed to be the stronghold of incumbent president George Weah. If this is anything to go by, a poor turnout in that county would mean the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) would drop in numbers. Our findings from a Facebook search revealed other posts suggesting different locations with the same pictures as seen here . However, we came across other posts that counter Mr Kollies post, which suggested that the place is not in Grand Geded or Nimba counties but in Montserrado County, as seen here and here . To authenticate the actual location, our researcher contacted a resident in Brewerville, Jessey Destiny Sayon, who lives near the school. The resident, Sayon, confirmed that the school is Diana E. Davies, located in Brewerville, District #17, Montserrado County. Furthermore, our search through the official Facebook page of the school showed the actual name and location are not Zwedru Multilateral High School, Grand Gedeh County, but Diana E. Davies, Brewervill City, Montserrado County. Furthermore, zooming in on the picture shared by Mr Kollie shows the initial D. E. D. for Diana E. Davies instead of Z. M. H. S. for Zwedru Multilateral High School. Also, our fact-checker, Elbie Sebleh, confirmed t a huge voter turnout at the Diana E. Davies High School. At Zwedru Multilateral High School in Grand Gedeh County, our contact, Justice Clarke, said that the voting process was a bit slow and had a semi-low turnout from the start but became huge as time passed.",1
"Claim: Social media messages suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine can transmit COVID-19 and may be responsible for hike in COVID-19 Cases in Liberia Although there has been a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia, there is no evidence that the administration of the AstraZeneca Vaccine is responsible for this. The suggestion that the vaccine can cause COVID-19 is FALSE. A new COVID-19 variant has emerged in Liberia as the country records a new peak in infections. While virus mutations are not unusual, those that are more infectious are worrisome, making people respond in different ways across various social media platforms. Speculations have emerged in street corners that the wave of increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia can be attributed to the Astrazeneca vaccine being administered across the country. On Saturday June 19, 2021, a Facebook user shared a post questioning whether or not it was the vaccine causing an increase in infection. In the post which has since been deleted, the user asked his Facebook following: have we noticed since the introduction of the vaccines, the cases have hiked? Roll-out of the AstraZeneca Vaccine The World Health Organization (WHO) early this year listed AstraZeneca and Oxford Universitys COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, widening access to the relatively inexpensive shot in the developing world. AWHOstatement said it had approved the vaccine as produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India. According to a study by the US Center for Disease Control , AstraZeneca committed to a partnership with Oxford University to ensure broad and equitable vaccine access globally during the pandemic. Liberia received 96,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, through the COVAX facility on April 1, 2021, joining many countries to officially launch the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The Minister of Health, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah, launched the vaccine at the Ministerial Complex in the presence of the UN Head of Agencies, the United Kingdom and European Union Ambassadors, representatives of other development partners, Cabinet Ministers, chairs of the health committees at the legislature, senior government officials and the media. The vaccines were later deployed to eight sites in Montserrado and Margibi counties including; the Number 14 Military hospital, JFK memorial hospital, Catholic hospital, Redemption and SOS Hospitals. Dr Wilhemina Jallah, Liberias Minister of Health in a phone call with his reporter on Wednesday June 23, 2021 dismissed this claim. Dr Jallah said the Ministry of Health was in possession of no reports or evidence that suggest that the vaccine is capable of infecting people with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , the AstraZeneca vaccines were tested in state-of-the-art laboratories, tried in thousands of renowned clinics and approved by WHO. The same vaccines are being administered all over the world, including countries in Africa, like Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali and Morocco. Dubawa found no evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine can get people infected with COVID-19 in any of these countries. According to a recent study by the UK based Public Health England , a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine reduced household transmission by up to half. It finds no evidence that AstraZeneca vaccine, which is also administered in Liberia, can also cause COVID infection. The Australian Governments Department of Health s patient information fact-sheet on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) also finds no evidence that the vaccine can infect people with COVID-19 once taken. The US Center for Disease Control says after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccinated person cannot test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test a test which is used to determine if an individual has a current infection. The CDC further states that none of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause a person to test positive on viral tests , which are used to see if one has a current infection. Neither can any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States. Cases of fully vaccinated individuals contracting coronavirus are rare, but not impossible. The CDC says a small percentage of fully vaccinated individuals will still get the infection but may make sickness less severe in such people. Given the scientific evidence available, the suggestion that AstraZeneca could be responsible for hundreds of new COVID-19 cases in Liberia is FALSE and Misleading.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims that popular Hollywood actor Jean-Claude Van Damme has passed after battling a stroke. Verdict: FALSE! The image used to portray the sick Mr Damme was doctored, and there is no news from the family confirming his death. Popular Hollywood actor known professionally as Jean-Claude Van Damme is a martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and fight choreographer. Mr Damme became a popular action film star with Cyborg in 1989. A Facebook user Ike Precious on June 2, 2023, posted a picture of a Hollywood actor with the caption, It just happened, Hollywood actor Jean-Claude Van Damme passed away at his home after a stroke. Ms Precious posted a picture of the actor with another picture of him supposedly on a hospital bed. In 2010, Mr Damme reportedly suffered a minor heart attack while shooting his latest film, Warrior, a day after his 50th birthday but fully recovered later. After the attack, Mr Damme has been in other movies and TV shows. The post had gotten different reactions, from people believing it was fake and others believing it to be true. Adeleke Bolanle used the exclamation symbol with R.I.P. Another user Onika Straker expressed his displeasure saying, It is a lie. Stop it. DUBAWA decided to investigate this claim because of the personality involved, the virality of the post, and the effect it has had on fans. To verify this claim, we ran an advanced keyword search and discovered that the post was also in circulation on YouTube, but it did not state an actual source for the claim. We then used TinEye reverse image search, which redirected us to Alamy, a site with stock photos and 360 panoramic images. We found out that the image used to portray the Hollywood actor was doctored, and the original one was a stock picture with an old man receiving treatment with the caption Unrecognizable doctor caring of a sick patient in resuscitation at nighttime, saving the life of a senior man lying on bed. We then used Google Lens and discovered that the original one had been doctored a few times with pictures of other celebrities that were hoaxed to be dead. A YouTube page known as deceased celebrities TV was found to be dedicated to this act. The page also used the picture to portray the death of Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell, amongst others. A link was also attached to the post on Facebook, but it links to betting sites, porn sites and VPN sites, which suggests the post was used as clickbait. We also compared the image posted on the claim with Mr Van Dammes picture and found out that while the one used had a tattoo on his left arm, his original picture posted on his Instagram page had no tattoo. In June 2019, it was also rumoured that the actor had died, but he himself posted a video debunking the claim, confirming he is alive and well. We went through the Instagram and Facebook pages of the Actor (@Jean-Caude Van Dames) and found nothing. There is no news about his death on any credible media outlet, and his family and friends have not made similar announcements. The actor also posted a picture on Facebook on June 21, 2023, several days after the rumour was shared. Hollywood actor Van Damme is not dead. The false news was used to gain traction on other websites. The families and management of Mr Damme have also not come out to share any news about his death.",0

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp video claims that soldiers are attacking residents of a community in Anambra State. The shreds of evidence gathered point to the fact that the video was not shot in Anambra State, but somewhere in Enugu State. While both the Army and some dailies point to Agwu LGA in Enugu, no open evidence points to anywhere in Anambra State. Its days before the Anambra gubernatorial elections and the headlines are already buzzing with the rumors and occurrences of violence across the state. Expecting the soaring chaos around the elections, the federal government has deployed over 34, 000 police officers to boost the security situation in the state. Anambra State has registered poor voter turnout in past gubernatorial elections and this has been largely linked to insecurity and electoral violence.The southeast has also been ridden with the activities of the Independent Peoples of Biafra (IPOB). The group has been imposing a stay-at-home in the region and is frequently reported to have clashed with the army. Even more, now that Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of IPOB, is being incarcerated by the federal government, the group has threatened to disrupt the upcoming gubernatorial elections and deter people from voting if Mr Kanu is not released. It is amidst this reality that a viral video surfaced, depicting some men, outfitted in Army uniform sporadically shooting and setting some buildings ablaze in an environment the attached narrative claims to be a village in Anambra State. The 23 seconds footage was widely shared on WhatsApp, arousing mostly fear amongst users who have come across it. The government should just postpone this Anambra Elections. People will just die for nothing. Insinuated a user on one WhatsApp group. Yet it didnt stop there, the same video reappeared on Twitter, this time with a slightly different caption: Nigerian soldiers shooting and burning villages. It garnered over 180,000 views close to 2000 retweets and close to 3000 reactions. While many users who commented on the post inquired where the video actually took place, the user, Knightsnkardinals (@ThisisKandK) offered no explanations. Already, there is a lingering fear among voters in Anambra, and a good number of the comments on the video points to that. An apparent theme from the comments inclines the potential of the video to not only dissuade people from going out to vote, but also to anticipate violence on the election day. An analysis carried out on the video showed it was not doctored nor altered. The video frame of the footage suggests it was covered using a mobile phone. Though we could not trace where it first appeared or who shared it first. Analysis of the keyframes on InVid video verifier showed the video appeared recently online. Open source tools used to pinpoint the actual location yielded no detailed results. Since the location was apparently a village, there were no major landmarks to determine the location. However, other reports made by major Nigerian dailies, such as Punch Newspaper, Thisday , and the Sahara reporters alleged that soldiers of the Nigerian Army had on Monday, November 1st, invaded Isingwu, a hamlet in Imama Village, Mgbowo in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State. While none of the reports mentioned Anambra State. Dubawa reached out to Major Abubakar Abdullahi, the acting Deputy Director Public Relations of the 82 Division Nigerian Army, via a text message and followed up with phone calls to clarify the claim that the video was shot in Anambra State, but no response from him was registered. However, in a press release made by the Nigerian army on Facebook, they alleged that soldiers had earlier carried out a raid in Mgbowo, Awgu Local Government Area that same day, 1st November. Troops of Joint Security Team have raided a suspected Indigenous People of Biafra/Eastern Security Network (IPOB/ESN) hideout located in Mgbowo, Awgu Local Government Area on 1 November 2021. During the night operation, two ring leaders of IPOB/ ESN were arrested. The suspects are currently undergoing interrogation by a security agency. In the statement, the army neither denied nor accepted that the men outfitted in the Nigerian military uniform are soldiers. It should be noted that, contrary to IPOB/ESN propaganda video, there was no incident of indiscriminate firing or unprovoked burning of houses during the raid. The joint operation in Agwu was conducted in the night and there was no destruction of any private property involved. And the second paragraph reads: Investigation into the video is ongoing to ascertain when and where it was shot and those involved. Any personnel found culpable would be sanctioned accordingly. Updates will be communicated when the investigation is completed, adding that any act of unprofessional conduct among troops will not be tolerated. While there is no sufficient evidence to prove where it actually happened, the claim that it has taken place in Anambra is baseless. The claimant did not mention where in Anambra state or even when. While different sources suggest that there was an army raid in Mgbowo, Agwu LGA, Enugu State, there is no single claim from open sources that backs the occurrence of the shooting in the footage in Anambra. Solomon Ifeanyi, a resident of Akwa, Anambra State, said via a phone call that we heard that the army had clashed with IPOB members in Enugu, Tuesday morning (November 2nd) but I dont think it was anywhere in Anambra. There is insufficient evidence to back up the claim that the incident in the video happened in Anambra state. However, evidence gathered suggests the event took place in Enugu, though we could not ascertain where exactly in Enugu.",1
"Claim : Nigeria is the only OPEC country, apart from Venezuela, that could not meet its oil quota. Verdict : False! While Nigeria could not meet up with its oil quota, there are other countries that are also unable to meet the OPEC benchmark. The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, and his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed, on January 8 appeared on Channels Television Town Hall meeting to discuss their action plan for Nigerians if elected. During the session, the LP flag-bearers were given the opportunity to answer questions from many Nigerians across the country. Mr Obi spoke on different aspects of the economy that need improvement and what his government will do differently. He also spoke on the issue of security, power and other sectors. While addressing the issue of oil theft in Nigeria, Obi said the country had not been able to meet the oil production quota set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Nigeria is said to have lost about N1.3 trillion to oil theft between January and August 2022, according to the ad-hoc committee set up by the Senate to investigate oil theft. Meanwhile, there have been a lot of clampdowns on oil thieves and vandals in recent times. Oil, which ordinarily is your (Nigerias) main source of foreign exchange income, is now being stolen. You (Nigeria) are the only OPEC country apart from Venezuela that could not meet your quota because people in government are stealing the oil, Obi had said while answering a question on measures to be adopted to help the country with a stable exchange rate. But is this true? Nigeria became a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1971 and has been described as the most populous country within OPEC. The oil quota for Nigeria set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 1.8 million barrels per day (BPD) from November 2022 to December 2023. However, the country could not meet its oil production quota for November 2022, according to data by OPEC. The countrys oil quota for the month stood at 1.18 million (OPEC crude oil production based on direct communication, tb/d million BPD). The figures were contained in the organisations Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) released in December 2022. Meanwhile, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) noted that Nigerias crude oil production increased to 1.23 million BPD in December 2022, according to its crude oil and condensate production data for the month. In its January 2023 MOMR , OPEC also confirmed that the country experienced 50 month-to-month change from 1.18 million BPD in November 2022 to 1.23 million BPD in December 2022. Despite the increase, Nigeria still falls short of its 1.8 million BPD quota set by OPEC. Further checks, however, showed that Nigeria is not the only OPEC country that could not meet its daily oil quota in the listed period. The figures revealed that Angola, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran, among others, also fell short of their required oil quota. OPEC data show that Ang ola produced 1.08 million BPD against the set quota of 1.5 million BPD; Saudi Arabia fell short of its 11.4 million BPD target to produce only 10.4 million BPD in the same month, while the UAE produced 3.043 million BPD against the set 3.17 million BPD. Similarly, Iraq produced 4.4 million BPD against the set 4.6 million BPD. Findings show the organisation had no oil quota for Venezuela in its 2022 MOMR. It only noted that the country produced 693,000 BPD in November 2022 and 669,000 BPD in December 2022. Despite its large oi l reserves, Venezuela has failed to meet the OPEC oil quota, partly due to its political and economic crisis. The claim that Nigeria and Venezuela are the only countries that could not meet their oil production quota set by OPEC is false. There are other countries that could not meet their targets.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the government of Dubai is giving out $110 as a Ramadan relief fund. Verdict: FALSE. Our research shows that the Dubai government is not distributing funds for Ramadan relief, and the message was spread maliciously. Worldwide, Muslims start their annual fast period in the month of Ramadan. During this period, information continues to flood the internet. Amid their fast, Muslims are bound to have a special need to buy foodstuffs and carry out their faith in good health which requires funds. Amid this, a message that the government of Dubai is sharing $110 as Ramadan Relief Funds, and every individual of all nationalities can apply. DUBAWA chose to verify this claim due to its virality and requests for verification. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the Dubai Ramadan relief fund mentioned in the message but did not find any. Our findings, however, showed different organisations and charities are giving out food to people during Ramadan. According to the Arab News, Dubais ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, started a program to sustainably provide hundreds of millions of meals to those in need during Ramadan. We subjected the link to Whois.com to verify the websites source, and we found that the website was created in Oyo state, Nigeria, not in Dubai. Another red flag is that people who visit the website can bypass the form on the page without filling out the application form, suggesting it is a malicious act. Another glaring red flag was the presence of fake testimonial statements. This is a common technique online con artists employ to entice prey into their cave. Despite not being clickable, the links to the alleged remarks still serve as a trickery tool for users. After clicking submit without inputting my details on the landing page, we came across messages that revealed the number of applicants is limited to 50,000. After submission, the website requests additional information from visitors before granting entry to the grant, as seen in the screenshot below; a trick commonly used by con artists to get people to visit their websites. Part of this additional information which is the request to share with groups and friends, explains why the message went viral on WhatsApp. Our findings show that the Dubai government is not giving out Ramadan relief funds, and the message was shared with ill intent. Hence the claim is false.",0
"Claim: A Twitter user claims the Retweet button on Twitter has been changed from blue to green in solidarity with Nigeria There is no new change to Twitters Retweet button as it has always been green. Amid the June 12 protest which is being promoted largely on Twitter, a Twitter user (@ ChibuzorUkwu ) claims Twitters Retweet button has been changed from blue to green in solidarity with Nigeria. Twitter has changed the retweet button colour from blue to green in solidarity with Nigerians on #June12thProtest. Excerpt of Twitter post caption. While some users in the comment section say the Retweet button has always been green, others say theirs is still blue. Dubawa conducted a Keyword search which led to a 2016 report by Independent announcing that the Twitter Retweet button had been changed from forest green to a much brighter, minty green shade. This search also led to a Twitter post in 2016 by Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) noting this change just as the Independent reported. There is no new change to Twitters Retweet button as it has always been green. Even when it was changed in 2016, it was from one shade of green to another and the change was in no way connected to Nigeria. This makes the claim false.",1
"Claim: A WhatsApp broadcast message claims that poisoned fruits from northern Nigeria cause an unnamed disease. Verdict: False. The viral image used to portray the unnamed disease, previously identified as mpox, was witnessed in Nigeria in the 1970s and between 2017 and 2022. However, no credible news outlet or reputable source has reported a recent outbreak in Nigeria. Despite being an end-to-end encryption messaging application, Metas WhatsApp users still largely use its broadcast message feature to reach out to wider recipients. As such, users have also rapidly exploited this feature to manifest unverified news content. Recently, a viral WhatsApp broadcast circulated on the messaging app, informing Nigerian users to be wary of certain fruits from northern Nigeria because they have been contaminated. The message also mentions that the Oba of Lagos (also known as the Eleko of Eko), Rilwan Akiolu, is the announcer of the viral message. Just got this from the Oba of Lagos palace now. Please dont eat carrots, apples, watermelons, and other fruits coming from the north, the broadcast message contained. We got a report that Boko Haram has sent over 54,000 apples to the southwest for sale, been poison with chemicals it further expressed. A screenshot of the viral WhatsApp broadcast message A screenshot of the viral WhatsApp broadcast message A similar post has also been shared on Facebook . Due to the virality of the post and its sensitivity, DUBAWA decided to verify it. We conducted a Google reverse image search and discovered a similar image to the one on the viral WhatsApp broadcast message on X . The photos, which were posted by X user ( @Jatiti_Of_Lagos ), were found to be linked with mpox. DUBAWA then did a brief Google search on a recent outbreak of mpox in Nigeria. A National Library of Medicine publication published on Jul. 7, 2023, highlights the period that Nigeria witnessed the disease, including between 1970 and 1980, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. The research paper provides statistics on the recent disease occurrence in Nigeria between Sept. 2017 and Feb. 2022. A scientific report in Nature also references similar dates when mpox was last witnessed in Nigeria, indicating 2022 as the year it last occurred. Besides, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has diagnosed that mpox is caused by the mpox virus (MPXV), a double-stranded virus of the Orthopoxvirus genus from the Poxviridae family. This virus has variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. Hindustan Times mentions that it is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans through close contact with an infected person or animal or with contaminated material. According to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) , infection occurs via contact with an infected animals (monkeys, rodents, and squirrels) blood, body fluids, skin, or mucosal lesions. This can happen through a bite, scratch, handling, or half-cooked infected meat. The disease control agency also mentions that limited human-to-human transmission can occur through prolonged face-to-face contact via respiratory droplets, body fluids of an infected person, and even contaminated objects, such as clothing and bedding. Nothing suggests that the disease can be contracted via poisoned fruits. Moreover, the Oba of Lagos, also known as the Eleko of Eko, has not issued a public statement warning people to be wary of poisoned fruits from northern Nigeria. Besides, no credible news outlet has reported a recent mpox outbreak in the country. The claim is false, as reliable reports inform that mpox was last recorded in Nigeria in 2022. Moreover, neither the Oba of Lagos nor credible media outlets have said or reported anything related to the outbreak of mpox. Editors Note: The word Monkeypox was reviewed to mpox, following the WHO guideline.",0
"Claim: The Obafemi Awolowo University will be embarking on an enforced break as it is to host the West African University Games (WAUG) this year. Verdict: FALSE! Interviews with school officials reveal that the school did not declare a break in academic activities. On Monday, Dec. 4, 2023, multiple social media posts circulating on WhatsApp platforms claimed that there would be a New Year holiday break at Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) from Dec. 15, 2023, to Jan. 8, 2024. The broadcast message stated that after a senate board meeting held on Friday, Dec. 1, 2023, the management of the University agreed that the break will commence from Dec. 15th, 2023, until Jan. 8th, 2024. An immediate holiday is scheduled due to an upcoming campus event from December 15th to 23rd that requires the use of the Hall of Residence by participants, the message reads, referring to the West African University Games (WAUG), which is to be hosted by the University this year . We thought to verify this because the rumours have put the university students in a frenzy, giving them the impression that they are bound to embark on holidays alongside the Dec. break. This fact-checker contacted the Universitys Dean for Student Affairs (DSA), John Odediran, who stated that the news is false, as it does not represent the views of the University management. We also spoke to the Universitys Dean of The Faculty of Technology, Professor Olufemi Adebola Koya, a Universitys senate committee member, who also confirmed it as false. He noted that the school is not going on break until Dec. 23, 2023, because WAUG is part of the schools life, so lectures will run concurrently. He explained that the number of participants for WAUG was not enough to displace the hosts. Usually, whether WAUG holds here or elsewhere, the participating sports teams are given exeat. Otherwise, all participating schools should shut down. Again, the number of representatives from other schools is not large enough to displace the host. The host should not vacate for guests to stay alone in the empty accommodation, he said. Prof Koya also revealed that the information had been circulating days before their senate meeting. The fake news has been circulating days before the senate meeting last Friday, which centred on only results. Omisore Elijah, the Students Union Public Relations Officer, also confirmed to DUBAWA that there is no break scheduled for the said period, as he had confirmed the news himself from the Universitys management. The information that there would be a break from Dec. 15, 2023, to Jan. 8, 2024, due to the WAUG games is false. The school authorities debunked the assertion.",0
"Breaking news: Tinubu planning to buy Labour Party and combine the partys vote to APC. According to details, he is pricing Labour Party 70B Naira, negotiation is still going on , reads a Facebook post published on 2 September 2022. Bola Tinubu is a former governor of Lagos state and lives in an affluent part of the city . He is the presidential candidate for the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The Labour Party , formerly known as the Party for Social Democracy (PSD), is one of the parties registered by the Independent National Electoral Commission . It is led by Peter Obi , who is also running for president in the February 2023 elections and has a huge following on social media . The APC and Labour Party are among the four frontrunners in the countrys 2023 general elections . The other two are the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). But is it true that Tinubu plans to buy the Labour Party? We checked. The Facebook post credits the information to Insidenews. But we could find no news outlet in Nigeria with this name. We did come across the Nigerian Insiders News (TNIN) , a website that reports extensively on Nigerian politics, but could not find any article claiming Tinubu wanted to buy the competing party. The original Facebook post doesnt give any concrete details about when or where Tinubu was meant to have made any statement like this or where the negotiations were taking place. This lack of detail is often a red flag that a quote circulating on social media is fabricated. There have also been no reports in the mainstream media of Tinubu making such a move . Such news would have made headlines, if it were true.",0
"Those that are seeking for job, most especially, our Youths should go and get this form from the Oyo State Hospital Management Board, begins a post on Facebook. Oyo state is located in the southwest of Nigeria, bordering Kwara state to the north and Ogun state to the south. The 11 January 2024 post also explains the application process in four steps: It claims that the state government is recruiting doctors, nurses and other workers. The unemployment rate in Nigeria rose to 4.2% in the second quarter of 2023. So posts about job opportunities, especially government jobs, will be of interest to many Nigerians. The same directions can be found on Facebook here , here , here , here , here and here . But is the Oyo state government hiring and is a N2,500 application fee required? We checked. Africa Check searched the internet for official confirmation of the claim and found none. According to the Leadership news site, the Oyo state administration has denied claims that it is recruiting medical personnel. The state commissioner for information and orientation, Prince Dotun Oyelade, told the media: It has come to the attention of the state government that some unscrupulous elements are peddling false information on purported sales of application forms for employment of Medical Personnel into the State service. The Oyo State Government hereby wishes to categorically state that there are currently no sales of such forms as the process for eventual recruitment is still ongoing. The state government also took to X (formerly Twitter) to debunk the claim. Posts that directly ask for an application fee are a sure red flag .

"By: Kennedy Twumasi and Jeffery Nyabor Claim: A Twitter user has published a picture purported to be of Nigerian chef Hilda Baci holding a certificate from the Guinness World Record. Verdict: Doctored. The image purported to be Nigerian chef Hilda Baci holding a certificate from the Guinness World Record is false. Using Tineye image search, DUBAWA traced the original photo to Rawpixel, a website for publishing stock photos. A Twitter user @HerStoryUG has shared a picture purporting to be Nigerian chef Hilda Baci with a certificate from the Guinness World Record for breaking a record of 100 hours of uninterrupted cooking. The current record holder is Lata Tondon, an Indian chef who achieved the feat in 2019 with 87 hours and 45 minutes. According to reports, she broke the record for cooking for over 96 hours. Already, Hilda Baci has received massive support for her attempt to break the current Guinness World Record. However, the Twitter caption of the photo by @HerStoryUG on May 16, 2023, says, Nigerian chef Hilda Bassey has won the Guinness world record for completing 100 hours of cooking by an individual. Congratulations, Hilda. The post has already received over 53,000 views and over 500 views. Even though reports have been widespread that Ms Baci has broken the Guinness World Record, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the image to discover if she has officially received her certificate from Guinness World Record. Investigation using Fotoforensics suggests that the image has had some edits done to it. The JPEG% in the Fotoforensics tool also shows a mass repetition of numbers. This is a red flag. This suggests that the image has, possibly, been edited multiple times. DUBAWA also ran a Tineye image search and was directed to Rawp ixel, a website dedicated to publishing stock photos. DUBAWA saw the original photo captioned, Cheerful black woman showing a vv sign with a blank speech bubble on the website. Original Fake Source: Twitter & Rawpixel In the photo above, it is evident that the face of the Nigerian chef Ms Baci has been edited into the original photo. The certificate allegedly from the Guinness World Record is also doctored. Meanwhile, a reply via the official Twitter handle of Guinness World Records indicated that the organisation knows Hildas fantastic record. Still, there will be a need to review all the evidence before officially confirming her record. Hilda began cooking on Thursday and continued through to Monday, reportedly whipping up 55 recipes and more than 100 meals in a whopping 100-hour stint, the May 16, 2023 publication reads. Officials on our records team look forward to reviewing the evidence and hope to be able to verify Hildas efforts as a new record very soon, the publication continued. A statement released by Hildas team confirmed that they were yet to be recognized by the Guinness World Record. We would like you to know we havent received the award yet, and were currently working on uploading our evidence, a statement issued on Tuesday, May 16, 2023, read. In view of this, Ms Baci is not yet certified by Guinness World Records. If Guinness World Record confirms her, she will overtake the current world record holder, Lata Tondon. The photo of Nigerian chef Hilda Baci allegedly holding a certificate from the Guinness World Records is doctored.",1
"In 2023, we verified different misinformation about financial institutions in Nigeria. Below are five times Nigerians misinformed the public about several financial institutions. Nigerian banks received a circular from the Nigeria Interbank Settlement System Plc (NIBSS) instructing them to remove non-deposit-taking financial institutions, such as switching companies, payment solution providers, and super agents, from their NIP fund transfer channels. Twitter (X) user Molaramills shared a picture on her page that reads, Opay, Palmpay, other non-deposit financial institutions to be taken down from fund transfer. She captioned it: Nigerian governments are only good at gagging and inflicting pain on their citizens. Opay, Kuda, PiggyVest, and the rest have been through everything for Nigerians, especially during that money crisis when our regular commercial banks are now their problem. They dont just like it when we are too comfortable with things. Our verification showed that Opay, Piggyvest, and Palmpay are not part of the institution listed by NIBSS to be removed from fund forward transfer. The policy enforcement aims to remove Fintechs without banking licenses from banks fund transfer channels. A Nigerian Journalist, Kemi Olunloyo, posted on her Facebook page that OPay was allegedly about to collapse and that people should start withdrawing their money from the scheme. This is a result of footage circulating on WhatsApp. The rumour carried by Ms Olunloyos on Opay crashing was false . We analysed the video circulating on WhatsApp as evidence and discovered it was an old video by TVC News on Aug. 23, 2021. The Bank also debunked the allegation via its social media account. A viral tweet by Olamide (@DymanFocus) suggests that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, ordered the shutdown of Nigerias OPay, Kuda, and Palmpay offices immediately. Our finding shows the post is false, as no press release or news story corroborates it. The Twitter user subsequently deleted the tweet. The official Twitter page for Palmpay Nigeria @palmpay Nigeria also debunked the rumour, assuring Nigerians that they are still in operation and reliable. A message circulating on WhatsApp claimed that Ecobank was granting a subsidy worth $8000 to clients with the Ecobank National Government. Participants of the scheme must provide their knowledge about the bank and answer a few questions about themselves to be considered winners of the financial scheme. When DUBAWA checked , we discovered that the scheme was a hoax. The fact-checker scanned the site on Scamdoc, a web tool that evaluates digital identities, and the analysis showed that the site has a terrible trust index and the owner of the sites domain name is hidden. Ecobank also announced via their official page that it was a scam. A broadcast message circulating in WhatsApp groups claims that network providers, bank transfers, and all relevant ICT units would be halted during the 2023 presidential and governorship election. To verify the authenticity of the WhatsApp message, DUBAWA contacted the corporate communications department of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). According to the spokesperson, Osita Nwasinobi, the message is untrue. Findings confirmed that the purported message telling Nigerians to withdraw their monies from banks until after the election was false.",1
"Claim: An X user shared an image showing President Tinubu and Peter Obi shaking hands, suggesting a partnership. Verdict: Misleading! The image used to represent the duo was initially taken in the State House when Indias Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, visited Nigeria for strategic partnership performance on Nov. 16 17, 2024. Meanwhile, no reputable news outlet reported the presence of former presidential candidate and Labour Partys 2023 party flagbearer Peter Obi at the State House visit. President Bola Tinubu and Peter Obi were major contenders for the top political seat in the country in the 2023 general election. However, Mr Tinubu, an All Progressives Congress stalwart, polled 37 per cent of the total votes cast to emerge Nigerias 16th president, ahead of Labour Partys Obi, who had garnered only 25 per cent. However, since the elections outcome, supporters of the two-time former state governors have pitted themselves against each other and tried to portray the rival candidates political incompetence. An X user, @adabanpegede , on Tuesday, Nov. 19, 2024, shared a picture showing President Tinubu and Mr Obi shaking hands over a certificate the latter is holding. Attached to the shared images was the Yoruba phrase Akinyeye na fe joye, ni ile yi ko ni ile biyafraud ni, meaning, A worthless person wants to become a leader. Not in this land. Its only possible where in Biyafraud. As of Monday, Dec. 23, 2024, the post has attracted about 207 views, 10 likes and three comments. Due to the opposing political relationship between the two politicians and to curb disinformation, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA subjected the picture to a Google Reverse Image Search. The result linked us to Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modis diplomatic visit to Abuja in November 2024. During the visit, Mr Modi met with President Tinubu , who shook hands with the septuagenarian and wore him a cloth sash before he was later awarded the Grand Commander of the Order of Niger (GCON). Premium Times also reported a similar development. Furthermore, we came across a photo publication by the Indian High Commission, Abuja. However, we noticed that the images taken of President Tinubu and his Indian guest resemble those shared by the claimant in which President Tinubu and Mr Obi are engaged in a handshake. We also checked President Tinubus official X handle, where we discovered a post shared on Nov. 17, 2024, with similar pictures featuring Mr Modi. DUBAWA discovered via a Punch report that the two leaders meeting was to discuss and sign several bilateral agreements to strengthen ties between Nigeria and India. We conducted keyword searches to know if Mr Obi was attending the meeting but saw no relevant results to the inquiry. Moreover, we checked Mr Obis X handle and saw no post linked to the meeting. DUBAWAs findings reveal that the images showing President Tinubu with Mr Obi have been digitally altered to create a false narrative.",0
"Claim: A Facebook post claims the WHO is recruiting. The claim that the WHO is recruiting is false as the WHO has distanced itself from the website that made the claim and any recruitment activity. A Facebook post by Recruitment Trust claims the World Health Organisation is recruiting with a link to access what it described as the WHO Recruitment 2020 Form and Portal Registration. The post, made on November 6, 2020, has been recirculated on Facebook. The post by Recruitment Trust has so far generated over 7,000 reactions, 478 comments and 472 shares. World Health Organization (WHO) job recruitment Apply Now https://bit.ly.2XnJq1H Excerpt of the Facebook message. Dubawa first observed that the link provided did not contain the organisations names like all its official websites do. Dubawa, however, went ahead to follow the link which led to another page with a pop-up message saying, Hi! Hey! Were Hiring Now! Are you looking for a job? This message also gives two options to answer Yes or No. After closing the pop-up message, different jobs were listed at different points from August 19, 2020, to January 8. Positions listed include: National consultant, programme management officer, external relations/resources mobilization (EXR) officer, etc. When Dubawa visited the page again using the same link, an error message was displayed, saying it was a bad gateway. This also questions the credibility of the site. Dubawa also reached out to its partners at the WHO who denied having anything to do with such recruitment or the website. We have no relation with this website, the organisation said. The claim that the WHO is recruiting is false and misleading as the organisation has denied any recruitment activity and distanced itself from the website that made the claim.",0
"Claim: The family of Justice Gloria Musu-Scott, in a recent statement, quotes the ruling party Chairman Mulbah Morlu as saying, their daughter Charloe Musu was killed for ritualistic purposes. Verdict: False. Online research on the particular Press Conference revealed that Morlu did not mention such a statement. The ruling party chairman also openly clarified the allegation to the media. The murder and armed robbery attacks on the home of Liberias former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu-Scott, have been greeted with several accusations, one of which is coming from the family of Justice Scott. Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was murdered on the morning of Thursday, February 23, 2023, at Justice Scotts residence in Brewville on the outskirt of the city. Other members of the household suffered injuries in the attack. It is not yet clear the motive for the murder and the attack but the news of the murder has since gone viral. The police have since begun an investigation into the matter. While citizens look forward to a speedy investigation and the arrest of the culprits, there have been some allegations and counter-allegations. One such is from the family of the former Chief Justice. On March 6, 2023, the family issued a statement accusing the ruling party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, of making statements against the family. The statement partly reads, On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change CDC, Mulbah Morlu, had a Press Conference at the CDC headquarters in Sinkor. It was held immediately after the Liberian Women Sit-in Action in protest at the Legislature on Capitol Hill seat against the murder and assault against the Musu family. The family statement accused Mr Morlu of saying Charloe was killed for ritualistic purposes. The murder of Charloe has triggered widespread, vehement public condemnation in the country. The institutions and groups that have expressed disdain over the attacks include the Liberia National Bar Association , former Vice President and Standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party, Joseph Nyuma Boakai . The gravity of the situation involving former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and her daughters death and the accusation against the party chairman form the basis for this fact-check. Given the sensitive nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to contact the family for evidence of its claim against the party chairman. But the family of the former Chief Justice, when contacted for a response, declined to verify the claim as indicated in their Press statement. The Family spokesperson Julius Musu in a telephone conversation with this researcher, said the family would not respond to the inquiry seeking answers over an allegation raised in their most recent release. All I can tell you is that the matter is before the police, and the family is cooperating, and that is all for now, Julius Musu said on the phone. The researcher scrutinised the video of March 2, 2023, press conference, which formed the basis of the ritual murder accusation attributed to Mr Morlu. From the scrutiny, it is clear there was no such accusation in the video. Though the family statement alleged that Chairman Morlu of President Weahs ruling Coalition said their daughter was used for ritual, he debunked the claim via telephone interview with OK FM on March 6, 2023 . His rebuttal, which can be heard between the 2:04:05sec on the show, among other things, rejected the claim, that is not true, I never said that. Several credible media institutions covered my press conference. The videos are out there. The claim by the former chief justice, Gloria Musu Scotts family, which accuses Mr Weahs three-party government chairman Mulbah Morlu of saying that Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was killed for ritual purposes, is false. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"INEC to destroy over 6 million uncollected PVC, reads the headline of a message circulating on Facebook in Nigeria. The permanent voters card (PVC) enables registered voters to vote. The card contains biometric data that can only be read by an electronic card reader. Nigerias Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) registers voters, issues permanent voter cards and conducts elections. The message reads, in part : The PVCs to be destroyed are ones that have remained unclaimed for ten years. The proposal is one of 208 recommendations resulting from the commissions review of the 2023 general elections. It continues: The policy is aimed at addressing the longstanding issue of unclaimed PVCs, with over six million cards left uncollected as of the 2023 elections, including many issued as far back as 2015. The claim can also be found here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Uncollected PVCs have caused concern in both governorship and presidential elections. Inec has urged Nigerians to collect their PVCs. But did the elections agency threaten to destroy uncollected cards? We checked. Incorrect story, says Inec There would be several problems with destroying uncollected cards. These include disenfranchisement, loss of confidence in Inec, waste of resources, risk of litigation and the potential for manipulation or fraud. Nigerians can be assured that Inec has no plans to destroy uncollected PVCs. On 5 January, Inec posted a message on its official Facebook page, asking the public to discountenance the story. Our attention has been drawn to a newspaper report that the Commission is contemplating the destruction of over six million uncollected Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) going back to the 2015 voter registration. The report is incorrect. At no time did the Commission contemplate the destruction of uncollected PVCs, the message reads.

"Claim: The NEC workers at St. Paul Lutheran campus in Kakata, with Center Code 24113, tell voters they forgot about The FRR. So, they should write down their names and vote. A staunch member of the main opposition Unity Party, Martian K. N. Kollie, made the claim. Verdict: True. A local journalist present at the centre confirmed it. The chairperson of research and rapid response of the main opposition Unity Party (UP), Martian K. N. Kollie, posted on his official Facebook page claiming that NEC temporary workers at St. Paul Lutheran school in Kakata, Margibi County with the Centre Code 24113, told voters that they forgot about The Final Registration Roll (FRR), urging the voters to write down their names on a sheet of paper and vote. The Final Registration Roll (FRR) is the official booklet containing the names, pictures, and some personal details of eligible registered voters. It is the FRR that determines whether or not a person is allowed to vote during an election. To verify the claim made by Martin Kollie, DUBAWA contacted a local journalist within the area, Emmanuel Tophic Degleh , a station manager of Classic FM in Kakata City Margibi County, who was present at the polling centre told DUBAWA that yes, it was true. Still, the polling staff resolved the situation by making available at least two Final Registration Roll (FRR) booklets to kick-start voting in the area. Journalist Degleh told our fact-checker that NEC temporary workers informed journalists that they forgot about the RFF booklets at their lodging place. However, they started the voting process while their colleagues were on the way with the booklets.",1

"Claim: Several accounts on TikTok and Facebook shared a video suggesting that the Vice President of Ghana was on stage singing a Chinese song. Verdict: The claim that Mahamudu Bawumia was singing a Chinese song is false. Our findings show the clip is a deepfake. In the democratic sphere, tarnishing individuals reputations through disinformation is a recurring issue, especially during elections. With Ghanas Dec. 7, 2024, election fast approaching, the countrys information ecosystem is increasingly vulnerable to misleading narratives, often aimed at discrediting political parties or figures. Mahamudu Bawumia (born on Oct. 7, 1963) is a Ghanaian politician and former central banker who serves as the 5th Vice President of Ghana in the 14th Ghanaian Republic. He assumed office on Jan. 7, 2017, as Vice President of Ghana and is the New Patriotic Party nominee for president in the 2024 general elections. Recently, some social media accounts shared a video suggesting that he was singing a Chinese song in front of a crowd. We first discovered the video on TikTok, shared by @onediamondug . The man identified as the Vice President of Ghana is heard saying, There is this Chinese song that I like, it goes this way. He then sings the song, followed by the artists original video. The post gained traction with 497,000 likes, 17,061 comments, 39,400 bookmarks, and 27,300 shares. In the comments, users like @Chocolateprince replied, Do they even know the meaning of the song? while @Ikraanfarxaan636 commented, Even if we dont know the meaning, we still love the song. @novasixcomedy added, Im sure he doesnt know the artist; he just knows the song. @Ejacstommy also said, Its even better than the original. Most people who commented believed Mahamudu Bawumia was the one in the footage. The same post was traced to different Facebook posts with the same narrative. See links here , here , here , and here . Given the virality of the post in the election season, DUBAWA decided to verify the claims authenticity. DUBAWA examined the video and observed several elements that doubt its authenticity. For instance, the lip-sync appeared misaligned, and when compared to another video of Bawumia speaking, the voice sounded noticeably different. Additionally, the audio quality seemed unusual, lacking the clarity typically found in other recordings. To verify further, DUBAWA attempted to analyse the video with Deepware.ai to determine its originality. However, due to the files corrupt natureoften a result of repeated alterationsan accurate analysis was not possible. DUBAWA went further to extract a screenshot from the video and used the forensic toolkit on InVid to detect signs of manipulation. An error analysis enhancer flagged the image as fabricated, confirming the suspicions about the videos authenticity. The original video was traced to a clip shared by Joy News on YouTube. The 38-second recording which was altered showed the Vice President in a humorous moment, gagging and laughing all through. All with no mention of a Chinese song. See the video here . After using various tools to assess the video, DUBAWA concluded that the content in question is a deepfake. The original footage was altered, with new elements superimposed to create a fabricated narrative.",0
"Claim: News report claims the president sacked the Central Bank governor. Our findings show President Muhammadu Buhari did not sack the Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele. Since information that Godwin Emefiele intends to run for president came into the public space, there have been calls for him to resign. Recently, President Muhammadu Buhari asked all appointed officers seeking political offices to resign . Although the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor first denied his intention to run , he went ahead to ask a court to declare him eligible for the presidential ticket of any political party while serving as the governor. This was, however. recently withdrawn . Following this, a screenshot went viral on WhatsApp with the claim that the president had sacked the CBN governor. This was shared on a WhatsApp users WhatsApp status with the caption if this is true, then buhari did a very good job. The said screenshot has the headline BREAKING NEWS; Buhari sacks CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele. The screenshot has the byline Opinion Nigeria and it was shared on Wednesday May 25,2022. We first carried out a keyword search on the byline in the screenshot to find if the said report actually exists or the image was created. We found the website opinionnigeria.com and the news story on the governors sack was shared 12 hours ago. The story which linked this sack to the presidents order that appointed officers should resign noted that the president cannot unilaterally sack the governor. We however noticed that the story did not quote anybody or platform as its source. This is suspicious because an ideal news story always has and quotes a source.. Having found that this screenshot was from an actual report, we needed to establish if the president actually sacked Mr Emefiele, so we conducted a keyword search on google. This led to fact-checks by Daily Trust, and BBC , and news reports by Punch , ripples Nigeria etc . debunking this. We also found out that the Central Bank chief of Algeria, Rostom Fadli, was recently removed . This may have fueled the rumour in Nigeria. A keyword search on Twitter led to a news report by The Nation , which debunked this claim quoting the CBNs spokesman Osita Nwanisobi. A look at the CBNs website showed there was so far no release on the rumoured sack. The latest release on the website is on Tuesday, May 24, 2022 on a fire incident at its Makurdi branch. Seeing that the banks spokesperson was quoted by the news reports debunking the claim, DUBAWA went ahead to send an enquiry email to the bank because it was too late to put a phone call across. Also, a look at the Twitter handle of the presidents spokesperson, Garba Shehu , showed nothing of that nature. No press release or announcement about the governors rumoured sack. The state house website which publishes news on the presidencys recent activities also did not have any news of the rumoured sack. Our findings and news reports show that the claim that president Muhammadu Buhari sacked the CBN governor is false.",1
"Claim: Social media users claim that the Lagos State Environment and Water Resources Ministry has re-introduced monthly sanitation exercises. Verdict: MISLEADING. Though the state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, flagged off a sanitation project, it is not a monthly exercise that requires an environmental shutdown. Also, the ministry debunked the claim, stating that the governors statement revealed the states plan to start a weekly community-based sensitisation and awareness exercise involving all residents. Choleras recent outbreak in Nigeria threatens residents health and well-being, subjecting victims to physical agony and financial expenses amidst the countrys economic crisis. The situation is worse in Lagos State , which is considered the nations economic capital. As of June 23, 2024, Lagos State accounts for over 34% of the 1,579 cases of cholera recorded in 32 states, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The state has earmarked strategic measures to alleviate the situation, including adopting an inter-agency collaboration . Different Facebook accounts have recently shared that the state will commence the monthly environmental sanitation exercise that may restrict human movement and activities by the end of July 2024. A report published by Daily Trust said that the state re-introduced the exercise about seven years after the Akinwumi Ambode-led administration cancelled the practice in November 2016. As of July 18, 2024, the post has gained 273 reactions, 11 comments, and 22 reshares on the newspapers verified Facebook page . It was also found here , here , and here . Most comments indicated criticism of the alleged directives, as the initial ground for the exercises suspension in 2016 was to avoid impeding the megacitys economic activities. The reactions we observed in the comments prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. We found the footage of the monthly environmental sanitation exercise flag-off on the state governments Facebook page. The footage, lasting for 50.51 minutes, recorded the speeches of Mr Sanwo-Olu and the commissioner heading the Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Tokunbo Wahab. As of 12.11 minutes, the ceremonial head welcomed attendants to the event, saying, I welcome you all to the flag-off of the monthly environmental sanitation exercise awareness programme. However, neither the commissioner nor the governor mentioned when the exercise would begin. DUBAWA discovered that the event was an awareness programme without a commencement date. Mr Wahab also released a statement last Saturday allaying fears of restriction in July, stating that the viral information is the work of mischief makers. The statement on his X account revealed that the governor simply announced his intention to be actively involved in community-based sensitisation every week. DUBAWA confirmed this information after watching the video. The state has yet to commence the environmental sanitation exercise, and residents will not be restricted from moving about their daily activities. The claim is misleading.",0
"By: Cole Praise and Lademi Aborisade Metas Third Party Fact-checking Program has been credited as the global funder for Fact-checking organisations. This was contained in the 2022 State of the Fact-checkers report by theInternational Fact-checking Network (IFCN). The report, which reflected an upward shift in the budget of fact-checking organisations worldwide, revealed that Metas third-party fact-checking program retains its position in 2021 as the highest funder. According to the 2022 report, Metas Third Party Fact-Checking program remains ahead of other funding sources for fact-checking platforms worldwide. It has so far not been overtaken because the program turns over 45.2% of its total income towards financing fact-checking organisations. Metas Third Party Fact-Checking program is still the leading funding source for fact-checking organisations, contributing 45.2% of their total income, the report reads. Metas funding is informed about how misinformation is a recurring problem and its interest in partnering with independent fact-checking platforms to mitigate its spread on social media. Meta, through original reporting, depends on fact-checkers to review the authenticity of stories posted on its social media app. The program has created the largest global fact-checking network and contributed over $100 million to programs that facilitate its fact-checking interests. In 2020, Meta partnered with fact-checking platforms to tackle COVID-19 mis- and disinformation peddled during the period. Together with IFCN, it floated a $1 million emergency grant program to that cause. Metas report on its investment in Fact-checking revealed it launched a health fellowship program with ten fact-checking organisations that will allow them to expand and combat health misinformation. The organisations operate in countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. In addition to combating health information, Meta partnered with global technology nonprofit Digital Health Lab at Meedan to fight online misinformation. In collaboration with the firm, several virtual training sessions were held between its medical staff and Metas third-party fact-checking partners. Other IFCN-partnership programs that Meta has funded include Climate Misinformation Grant, Global Fact-checking Mentorship Program , and Fact-Checking Innovation Initiative . Meta also funded a year-long fact-checking fellowship with the National Association of Black Journalists , creating an avenue for fact-checking platforms to hire potential journalists. It also floated an Accelerator Challenge program that pooled various fact-checking organisations to share ideas and create new strategies to enable people to access the right information. During election periods, Meta, formerly Facebook , has always thrown its weight behind fact-checking organisations worldwide to propagate truth and debunk false information.",1
"Claim: A TikTok user claimed that Gambian sensational singer Jizzle had met Nigerian Afrobeat superstar Davido. Verdict: False. The claim that Gambian singer Jizzle has met Nigerian Afrobeats superstar Davido is false. A TinEye Reverse Image Search shows the picture was manipulated. A TikTok user posted a photo of Gambian sensational singer Jerreh Jallow, whose stage name is Jizzle, with Nigerian superstar David Adeleke, whose stage name is Davido. Jizzle is one of Gambias most popular Gambian singers with numerous hit songs. As of July 25, 2024, the post, shared on TikTok, had gathered over 8,489 likes, 153 comments, 1,456 favourites, and 38 shares. In the comments section, people shared diverse opinions, with some suggesting it was an edit while others believed it was real. The photo has since generated mixed reactions. A user @TIO said : Seems Photoshop because their colour corrections are not the same. @Abdosevan5 also commented on the post, saying, So Jizzle dont care to put his shoe on Davido my friend, this na edit. @Lamin commented: Who told you guys this is an editing? It is a real-life thing. Against this backdrop, DUBAWA ran a fact-check to determine the posts authenticity. A Tin Eye Reverse Image Search revealed that the picture of Jizzle and Davido has been manipulated several times; see here and here . DUBAWA sighted the original picture of Davido that was posted on March 14, 2020 . The post said Davido had postponed his concerts in America. Nigerias top singer, David Adedeji Adeleke [Davido], has cancelled his concerts in the United States of America due to the coronavirus pandemic, the post said. An examination of the image of Jizzle shows that the picture has been superimposed on the photograph of Nigerian Superstar Davido. Also, Jizzle is currently outside the country on a European Tour and frequently updates his activities on his official Facebook page, Jizzle, which has over 237k followers. When DUBAWA checked Jizzles social media handles, including Facebook, he did not post the alleged photo with Davido. We also checked major news media and online platforms in The Gambia; there were no reports of Jizzle meeting Davido. DUBAWA also contacted Jizzles management, who described the post as false. This is fake and edited. Jizzle has not met David, said Jalika, a member of Jizzles management. The claim that Gambian singer Jizzle has met Nigerian Afrobeats Superstar Davido is fake.",1
"Claim: A TikTok user shared a video clip spotlighting Liverpool boss Arne Slot, slamming umpire Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby. Verdict: False. The TikTok video clip is a digitally altered version of an Australian-owned sports channel, Optus Sports, interview with Slot, in which he expressed pleasure in his sides triumph over Ipswich Town. Current Premier League leaders Liverpools 2-1 lead over derby rivals Everton was cut short when James Tarkowski scored a 98th-minute equaliser. Both sides squared up equal points after the game at Goodison Park. But the equaliser became a domino effect that sparked chaos when the final whistle blew. Liverpools Curtis Jones charged at Abdoulaye Doucoure, who had moved to the visitors stand to taunt them in celebration. Both players were punished with red cards but were not the only recipients on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. Michael Oliver also handed Liverpools head coach, Arne Slot, and assistant Sipke Hulshoff, red cards. This was just as the Dutchman had gripped Oliver in his direction in what was supposed to be a handshake and Slots seeming disapproval at the events of the last minutes. In the aftermath of the derby bedlam, a TikTok user, @veryscaryai , claimed via a video clip that Slot criticised Oliver, accusing the football umpire of receiving money from Evertons president and loathing Liverpool. I told Michael Oliver tonight to give me some of the money he made from the Everton president, and he showed me a red card. I dont know why he took offence to that, but we all know its true this dude hates Liverpool Slot was allegedly heard saying. The Dutchman further alleged Oliver was complacent about unprofessionalism. Yes, he is an awful ref. Everyone knows that. I saw him doing a knee slide when Everton tied the game at the end. It was shocking to see, the Reds coach allegedly said. As of Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025, the post has earned over 64,800 likes, 1,705 comments, 5020 bookmarks, and 11,400 shares. DUBAWA noticed a divide in the opinions expressed towards the post by other TikTok users. While some shared the same sentiments in the managers comments, others pointed out that the video clip had been digitally manipulated. FIFA should come out about Michael Oliver. He added (five) minutes and Liverpool (conceded) in (seven) minutes, Lubowa John757 expressed. No way this man (Slot) says this. This must be AI or something. RAJI viewed. Due to the divergent opinions and the sensitivity of the claim, DUBAWA decided to verify the videos authenticity. DUBAWA noticed both the Premier League and Liverpool logos on the background wallpaper in the area where Slot allegedly berates umpire Oliver. Apparently, it is set in Anfield Liverpools sports arena while the derby clash on Wednesday was played at Goodison Park (Evertons home). We conducted keyword searches on Google for post-match interviews that occurred at Anfield. We found some interview sessions with a background similar to that shared in the TikTok video clip. After scrutiny, DUBAWA found the interview setting showed the Liverpool manager answering questions in a context different from what was portrayed in the claimants post. In the original interview shared by Optus Sports, an Australian-based football streaming platform, on YouTube , Slot praised his teams side for being ruthless in their comfortable 4-1 victory against Premier League counterparts Ipswich Town on Jan 25, 2025. He further hoped his father was more enthralled at the game than when they had defeated Ligue 1 side Lille at the Champions League group stage three days before. I think he would. To be clear, he thought the little game wasnt as exciting as the other ones we played a week before. Because a week before, we had 37 shots on target, which was a record for an away team in the Premier League, Slot could be heard saying. And to be fair, Ipswich had a similar playing style to Lille. So it is not always easy to be exciting for us. But with us scoring four goals, I assume he finds it more exciting than the little game, the Dutchman said of his father about his games. Another prominent feature in both videos is the Liverpool managers active gesticulations, as his body language portrays the emotions in his words. But more importantly, these gesticulations are similar in the interview by Optus Sports and the TikTok video clip a bemused smile plastered on his face, the relaxed raising of eyelids, shrugging of shoulders, and a confident nodding of the head. However, Optus Sport posted the interview session on Jan 25, 2025, three weeks before the TikTok user shared the video clip. Besides, when Oliver disciplined Slot with a red card, it cost the latter the privilege of sharing his side of the incident with the press because Premier League rules instruct that any player, coach, or manager sanctioned with a red card would be debarred from participating in the post-match interview. Consequently, there was no way the Liverpool manager would have indulged in interview sessions after the match. When he talked to the press the next morning , he was somewhat remorseful about the incident, mentioning that emotions got the better of me. We subjected the video to deepwareai , but it detected no deepfake material. Careful analysis of the video clip shows it has been digitally altered from its original version.",0
"Claim:The Kano State Government, through the Commissioner for Information, has denied stories widely reported across media platforms that Kanos powerful First Lady, Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, popularly known as Goggo had anointed the State Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo, aka Commander as successor to her husband claiming she was quoted out of context and had only commended his performance A content analysis of the video footage where the Kano state first lady, Hajiya Hafsat Ganduje made the statement including a careful observation of her disposition, length of time she took in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government. The state governments claim therefore is MISLEADING. The Kano state government has refuted reports attributed to the First Lady, Prof. Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in which she is reported to have endorsed Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023. In a statement issued by the state commissioner for information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the State government explained that the governors wife was quoted out of contest in the trending video clip on the social media platform. In the video, the statement added, the First Lady was only thrilled by Garos performance whom she fondly called Commander and for his support for the policies and programmes of Governor Ganduje and his administration in the state. Recently, media reports were rife that the First lady popularly known as Goggo has at a function in Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano State on Saturday while addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme, said Murtala Garo is the ideal person to succeed their government as he posses all the needed attributes. Recall that in the 2019 gubernatorial election, Mr. Garo allegedly disrupted the process by tearing result sheets at Nasarawa Polling Unit of the State which led to the declaration of the election inconclusive. Garo was arrested by police officers alongside chairman of the Nasarawa LGA Lamin Sani and the state Deputy Governor Nasiru Gawuna for allegedly storming the collation centre and destroying election results sheets. The commissioner, who was almost stripped naked in the fracas, was reportedly beaten to pulp together with his accomplices before being arrested. They were detained at the state police command headquarters in Bompai area and interrogated before they were released on bail. The police command under then CP Mohammed Wakili, nicknamed Singham, vowed to prosecute Garo and Sani but his tenure did not last longer. A content analysis of the video footage where the first lady, Professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje popularly known as Goggo made the statement reveals that she was addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme at Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano state and she had spoken at length in praise of the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo who was nicknamed Commander after the election disruption debacle. In her own words, the first lady had said, what the governor wants is educated, agile, and hardworking young men to steer the affairs of our Local Governments. He also wants hardworking youths to succeed him. I remember, while on a short trip. At all times He is here listening to me, in every battle, there has to be a Commander (Mr. Garos nickname) had spent sleepless nights. I swear to God, he didnt sleep because he was working hard to discharge his responsibility as a commissioner. I hope you chairmen are listening to me? You are hearing this from Goggos mouth. Therefore, these are the people that His Excellency said they would succeed him , Mrs Ganduje said. A careful observation of her disposition, length of time taken in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government. Commenting on the matter, Musa Sani Alyu, a broadcast Journalist with Jalla radio 98.1FM Kano said, What happened was that Goggo spilled the beans. What is on the mind is what is on the face. What the first lady said at the event was very clear and it is directly proportional to the state governments intention. We all know she is one of the most influential people in the government, that is the reason they opened an office for her, the office of the wife of Kano State governor, which did not happen in Kano prior to now. What Goggo said, the inclination has shown thats whats on her mind and she wants him to be the candidate because he is her puppet. Everyone knows the depth of his loyalty to the first lady. So she was clear enough and they tried as much to retract the anointment but the damage had already been done. As a broadcast journalist in Kano, i carefully follow all the news and i am much interested in the affairs of Kano state government and i know the first lady meant what she said. Lets wait till 2023 you will see unexpected things happening especially on gubernatorial candidates . Also commenting, Nura Yusuf, a Kano based public affairs commentator said, Goggo could not hide her emotions anytime it comes to Sule Garo because If he hadnt played the role he played at the Nassarawa collation center during the 2019 gubernatorial elections, there would be no Ganduje government today. The state governments claim is just damage control because it was obvious some forces within the party were upset on the issue that was why they brought something that will whitewash the statement, Another commentator, Salis Mohammad Manaja, a political analyst observed that the story was not debunked until about two days after when the issue started generating rancour within the party. They did that to control the internal crisis emanating within the government, it would have been better if the government had claimed that the first lady preempted the situation rather than denying what is obvious from the clip we saw , Manager said. Arguments by the commentators are consistent with the image repair theory in crisis communication, a subspecialty of the public relations profession which is designed to protect and defend an individual or organisation facing reputational challenges. The image repair theory (IRT), recommended by Professor William Benoit, a scholar in the field of political communication, University of Missouri , identifies five general approaches to responding to accusations or suspicions. These are Denial, Evading Responsibility, Reducing Offensiveness, Corrective Action, and Mortification. Based on content analysis of the video footage of the subject matter, and arguments from public affairs commentators, claims by the Kano State government that the first lady, professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje did not endorse Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023, is MISLEADING. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with PRNigeria to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: Russian Airplane with registration number: RA-76845 conveyed Wagner group soldiers to Niger Republic on Sunday, August 20, amid an ongoing coup in the country. The claim went viral days before the reported death of Yevgeny Prigozhin, leader of the Wagner mercenary group, on August 23. Verdict: False. According to the flight tracker, the aeroplane only moved from Syria to Bamako on the said date, after which it returned to Moscow the following day. Following the July 26 coup in Niger Republic, the social media space has been awash with misinformation regarding happenings in the West African country. Recall that Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum was deposed in a coup led by General Abdourahamane Tchiani. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had made known its intention to reinstate civil rule in the country even if it requires military force. This, however, has been met with criticism, particularly from Nigerians. The ECOWAS, led by Bola Tinubu, is weighing alternatives to restore peace in the country. The criticisms of the proposed military action in Niger followed fe ars that such reactions could adversely affect Nigeria and other West African countries. Meanwhile, there are narratives surrounding Russias intervention in the Niger coup. Several media reports established that the coup leaders had sought help from the Russian Mercenary group Wagner. In a voice message shared on Telegram channels associated with Wagner, the mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was said to have hailed the Niger coup, which he described as a welcome development. However, the group had not officially confirmed its involvement in the coup. Also, recently, a video from the Telegram channel showed Mr Prigozhin in a desert in camouflage with a rifle in his hands. Though the location of the video had yet to be ascertained, several news reports had suggested the video clip was shot in Africa. We are working. The temperature is plus 50 (degrees Celsius). Everything is how we like it, he was quoted as saying. On the Nigerian social media space, fears continue to mount over ECOWAS intervention in Niger coup and the resultant effect on Nigerias territorial integrity and defence. Amid conversations around the coup, a social media user, J.C Okechukwu @jcokechukwu, posted a claim on his X (formerly Twitter) handle claiming a Russian military plane with registration number RA-76845 had just transported Wagner group soldiers from Syria to Niamey, the Niger Republic Capital. He claims the Wagner group has told the new Nigerien administration, Never to worry about any foreign army on Niger soil and specifically assured the leadership that Wagner will take on the Americans head on if they ever dare to get involved in the conflict with ECOWAS, or try to deploy their drones. When this report was filed, the post had been viewed over one million times and had over 4,000 retweets. The post, alongside the images attached, attracted the views of many X users who believed the claim, while some doubted its authenticity. A user @PrinceSomorin, commented, This is practically in our doorstep. Another user @KMutisi stated, ECOWAS must stop being used by France & the US. No African should die fighting for Western imperial interests. Also, DUBAWA observed that many X users reshared the post on their handles, further fuelling misinformation as seen here , here and here . A look into one of the Telegram Channels affiliated with the Wagner Mercenary Group showed that the aircraft departed Moscow, Russia, on August 18 and headed to Bamako with a stopover in Damascus. The Intel was posted on August 19. Also, DUBAWA made use of Planefinder , a flight-tracking app. Details from the search revealed that the Ilyushin IL-76-TD aircraft was operated by MCHS Rossii Guap (Ministry for Emergency Situations). Also, it showed that the plane had been en route to undisclosed locations from August 15 to 21 at different times respectively. Using FlightAware , another flight tracking app, search results showed that the aircraft took off from Zhukovsky International Airport (Moscow, Moskovskaya) Zia on August 15 and arrived at Uytash airport (Makhachkala), a civil airport in Russia. On the same day, it reportedly moved to Veliky Ustyug, another area in Russia. On August 18, the flight departed from MSK near Moscow, Russian Federation and landed at Damascus Int. By August 19, the aircraft had moved from Damascus to Bamako and on 20th August it was en route from Bamako to Damascus, Syria. On Monday, it reportedly moved from Syria to Russia. A further search on Planespotters.net showed that the picture had been originally taken at the Tyumen Roschino (TJM / USTR) airport in Russia on May 13, 2023. The aircrafts serial number provided was 1043420696. Therefore, the image posted by the social media user does not depict the Russian aircraft landing on Nigers soil as of August 2023. Also, DUBAWA observed that information posted on the Wagner groups telegram channels suggests interest in the Niger coup. However, according to an August 12 post on one of the channels, PMC Wagner has not yet been recorded on the territory of Niger. Another post on August 18, said, There are no wagnerites in Niger now, but this doesnt mean they cannot appear quickly. The Wagner group has established a presence in the neighbouring countries of Mali and the Central African Republic. There are fears that the group may get to the Niger Republic shortly. In a fresh t wist, on August 23, Mr Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary chief, reportedly died in a plane crash in Moscow, Russia. According to media reports, seven passengers were on board and three crew. The claim that a Russian Airplane with registration number: RA-76845 flew Wagner group soldiers to Niger Republic on Sunday, August 20, is false. The viral picture of the plane was originally taken at a Russian airport on May 13, 2023.",0
"Claim: Twitter user claims that God struck Boko Haram with lightning while on their way to Niger (Nigeria) to destroy Biafrans. The claim that God has struck Boko Haram forces with lightning while on their way to Nigeria to destroy Biafrans is false. The alleged image used to depict the narrative was taken from a fire incident that took place in Tanzania back in 2019. A Twitter user, Dr Ken (@DrKen43273749), claims that God has struck Boko Haram insurgents with lightning whilst on their way to Nigeria to attack Biafrans. The user attached the narrative with a horrifying image showing a considerable number of charred bodies lying on the ground and made visible to onlookers. The God of our land will always destroy them. Boko Haram terrorist trying to enter Niger to come and destroy Biafrans, but God strike them with lightning, the user stated. Biafra was a state constructed by secessionists in Southeast Nigeria after some Igbo military leaders unilaterally declared their independence from Nigeria in May 1967. It constituted the former Eastern Region of Nigeria and was inhabited principally by Igbo people. Biafra ceased to exist as an independent state in January 1970. However, the Indigenous People of Biafra ( IPOB ) was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, to restore the independent state of Biafra. Boko Haram is also popularly known in Nigerian and Western media as Boko Haram, which means Western education is forbidden. Since its inception in 2009, the group has wreaked havoc on the country, causing the deaths and displacement of many civilians, especially in the north-eastern part of the country. The alleged claim has garnered some traction on social media, particularly on Twitter, insinuating that Boko Harams plan to attack Biafra (Igbos in the south-east) was intercepted by God. One user, Taffy Ebuka (@Taffyebuka), even commented that a similar incident had happened before but was equally intercepted. Its always happening to them anytime they try to invade our land, last time it was an accident, today it was on fire Boko Fulani you cant win us and your time is up, 2023 is our turn. Nigeria is currently facing problems of insecurity and with diverse news of tension around the country, such claims are capable of inciting unrest and fear amongst the populace. A Google reverse image search conducted on the image traced it to a Reddit post in 2019 about a tanker explosion incident in Tanzania that killed over 70 persons. Similarly, the image was also featured on Media Brest and Spy Uganda , when a crashed tanker exploded and killed at least 62 people who were trying to syphon off the fuel in the Tanzanian town of Morogoro. In a news report by CNN and other news media outlets, the incident was confirmed to have taken place. In fact, The Tanzanian police described the unfortunate circumstance as one of the worst tragedies of its kind to befall the East African country. Aside from victims that lost their lives in the incident, the Tanzanian state broadcaster KBC, citing police figures, said at least 70 other people were injured during the explosion in the town of Morogoro, about 120 miles west of the economic hub of Dar es Salaam, the capital. Furthermore, in one report by Daily Express on the incident, a picture was featured that captured a Tanzanian policeman standing at the scene of the accident. Concurrently, the same policeman also appeared in the alleged image, confirming the fact that the incident took place in Tanzania and not anywhere in Nigeria. See details in images 1 and 2 below: Image 1 is the alleged picture shared by the claimant. Apparently, a Tanzanian police officer is seen in the background (circled in red) putting on a blue shirt and khaki trousers.Image 2 (below) is the picture used by Daily Express to report on the incident. Noticeably, the same policeman is seen in the background. Evidently, the alleged picture has been used in different contexts to spread false narratives. In India, the same picture was used to spread disinformation about a fire outbreak but fortunately, it was debunked in this fact-check. This is also not the first time DUBAWA is debunking false claims related to this same fire incident in Tanzania. In June this year, a video from the incident was falsely shared on WhatsApp alleging that bandits were roasted by lightning on their way to attack Christians in Zamfara State. The picture used to spread the information of a Boko Haram planned attack on Biafra and, by extension, the southeastern parts of Nigeria is false. The picture was originally taken in Tanzania, when a fuel tanker exploded, killing many people.",0
"CLAIM: Eating too much cassava can be deadly. VERDICT: MISLEADING. Credible medical publications and professionals reveal that an individual is at death risk if he or she consumes cassava produce that has been prepared haphazardly. Cassava is a highly consumed food in Nigeria. Globally, the country is recognised as the highest exporter of produce and accounts for one-third of cassava production in Africa. However, a Facebook handle, identified as THE APOSTOLIC CHURCH (YOUTH WINGS), has stated in a post that excessively consuming cassava can be life-threatening. Eating too much cassava can be deadly, part of the post reads. The post cites that the root crop contains cyanogenic glycosides, which can release cyanide gas. It also cautioned that any food product from the crop should be properly prepared before consumption. Knowing how well cassava is cherished, especially as a staple food among Nigerians, we decided to fact-check the assertion. Writing for MedicalNewsToday, Danielle Dresden highlights the nutritional value of cassava and identifies it as a source of energy, protein, calcium, and fibre. She writes that the crop is a good source of vitamin C, thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin. Furthermore, according to the article , cassava is a good source of resistant starch, which health experts say can improve gut health. This is also a fact that Healthline shares , as Rachael Ajmera and Brianna Elliot further mention some of its nutritional content. They include calories, protein (1.5 gram), fat (3g), carbs (40g), fibre (2g), vitamin C (20% of daily value), copper (12% of DV), Thiamine (7% of DV), folate (6% of DV), vitamin B2 (6% of DV), potassium (6% of DV), magnesium (5% of DV), and niacin (5% of DV). MedicalNewsToday informs about the toxic properties that may materialise as a result of consuming the food product and acknowledges it as a consequence of improper preparation. Ms Dresden explains that an individual risks health-related injuries if he consumes cassava in its raw form. She links the cause to the presence of naturally occurring forms of cyanide within the crop and asserts that it triggers poisoning if ingested. Significantly, she attributes some major occurring health deficiencies, including body paralysis, low levels of iodine, abnormal growth such as goitre, poor vision and even death, in areas where cassava is constantly consumed. However, the toxicity in cassava is not hinged only on the cyanide it contains. It can also endanger the health of human beings when air pollutants settle on its upper part, such as its stalk and leaves. According to Ms Dresden , pollutants such as trace metal elements, herbicides and pesticides circulate in the environment and sometimes settle on the plants. Both Ms Ajmera and Ms Elliot caution in their article for Healthline that cassava should be consumed in moderation due to its high calories and harmful chemicals. They also advise that before the plant is eaten, it must be properly cooked because it is poisonous if consumed raw. They explain that cassava, in its raw form, contains a chemical material identified as cyanogenic glycosides. They both assert that constantly consuming cyanogenic glycosides can trigger cyanide poisoning, a situation that is very well associated with impaired thyroid and nerve function, paralysis, organ damage, and death. Although both research authors state categorically that processing methods of the crop, such as peeling, chopping and cooking, can reduce its nutritional value, they still advise the culture of cooking the root crop before consumption. They added that cooking methods such as boiling retains more of the crops nutrients compared to roasting and frying. Back in 2017, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encountered an epidemic situation in Kasese district in western Uganda. However, the epidemic was only unravelled after a certain funeral had been conducted on Sept. 5, 2017, and about 15 persons were diagnosed with similar ailing conditions. The affected persons shared identical symptomatic conditions such as diarrhoea, vomiting, and abdominal pains, which later were linked to food poisoning. An investigation was consequently carried out, and it was discovered that the victims of the poisoning had consumed a cassava dish of cassava flour mixed with hot water. Upon further findings, it was discovered that all the victims had bought cassava flour from retailers who had, in turn, purchased the flour from a single wholesaler, whose product was found to have a high cyanogenic content. When the compromised bags of cassava flour were seized, and laboratory analyses were carried out, it was discovered that the cyanide content was equivalent to an average of 88 parts per million (ppm) of cyanide. That is eight times more than the recommended safe level of 10 ppm needed. Thereafter, health education and orientation were given to the locals of the Kasese about cyanide poisoning and the processes to adopt to reduce its content in cassava. A National Library of Medicine (NLM) study reveals that cassava leaves and roots cannot be consumed due to two cyanogenic glycosides- linamarin and lotaustralin. Both are decomposed by linamarase, a naturally occurring enzyme in cassava used to liberate hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from the crop. The study further reveals that 5/6 of cyanogenic glycosides are broken down by linamarase, thus allowing HCN to escape into the air and making cassava edible for consumption. However, that process doesnt completely erase the cyanogenic material from the crop, but the rest is cleared out during digestion through detoxification. Centre for Food Safety writes that cyanide glycosides are a group of chemical compounds which occur naturally in over 2000 plant species. It further asserts that about 25 cyanide glycosides are found in edible plants. Significantly, the study mentions that cyanogenic glycosides are non-toxic, but due to the presence of enzymatic hydrolysis by beta-glucosidase, following maceration by plant tissues, cyanogenic glycosides are broken down to release hydrogen cyanide. This hydrogen cyanide can be very toxic to both plants and animals. In a conversation with food nutritionist and dietician Temiloluwa Omotoso, she divulged that cassava in its raw form is very poisonous. She further stated that because cassava is a root crop, it contains a material she identified as cyanogenic content. Consequently, the crop has to be properly processed to get rid of the material. Ms. Omotoso highlighted a host of processing methods that could be adopted to eliminate cyanogenic content in cassava. She explained that locally, especially in the production of Garri and fufu, cassava is usually soaked, cooked, or fried. She emphasised that heat kills off cyanide in food crops and guarantees healthy consumption when people consciously adopt the culture of properly cooking the food crop. She also made mention of soaking the cassava tubers in water for a longer duration of time, as this method weakens and neutralises the cyanide toxicity. However, the dietician informs that aside from an intentional practice of correctly processing cassava, nothing else makes it a death risk for consumption, not even excessive consumption. She says there is no scientific backing for that. Also, in a correspondence with another dietician, Bunmi Ojo, who works at the University College Hospital (UCH) Ibadan, she identified that all foods contain nutrients. She further agreed that cassava contains toxicants, which she identified as cyanide. However, she noted that if rightly prepared washing, peeling, fermenting, etc the toxic material reduces to the bare minimum. The dietician pointed out that cases where bizarre casualties- including death- occur after food intake can be attributed to poor preparation of such foods. Ms Ojo also noted that death may not be the immediate repercussion but that damages can occur internally, destroying body organs and even leading to body paralysis. She advocated for careful processing and preparation of cassava produce: peeling, soaking and frying it before consumption. The claim is misleading. Credible medical publications and observations by experts all emphasise that a person is only at risk of incurring death if the cassava food consumed is not properly prepared.",0
"Claim: Adekunle Gold was a football teammate of Mbappes. Verdict: FALSE. Open source data reveals that Kylian Mbappe was six when he joined AS Bondy football academy and Adekunle Gold was 17. Furthermore, an interview with Punch newspaper indicates that Adekunle Gold was neither an academy football player nor a professional. Apart from the usual chit-chats social media users engage in, different aspects of a celebritys life have never been excused in the public discourse. A Facebook user, Sunday Godpaid , wrote on his page that Afrobeats singer and songwriter Adekunle Kosoko (professionally known as Adekunle Gold and AG Baby) was a former football teammate player with France forward and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) star Kylian Mbappe. So Adekunle Gold was Mbappes former teammate(?) Grace, he wrote. Attached to his post was an image of Mr Mbappe and his teammates dressed in AS Bondy jerseys meant for football academy players. In the picture, both the French forward and Adekunle Gold were circled to further depict being teammates. As of Tuesday, Nov 20, 2023, the Facebook post attracted 108,000 likes and 5,000 comments, and was shared 789 times. The reactions to the post were diverse. Grace found the two of them. Miller Sweetlife commented . Abeg talk (about) another thing. (We) know (that) this thing no go fit possible. So rest abeg. Eseoghene Gift remarked . However, due to the controversial sentiments that the post generated, we decided to verify it. We found the images origin is linked to the Polaris Gramatnica book sale website. On the website, the image is among the ones used by France Football to illustrate Mr Mbappes milestones as a professional footballer. Britannica , a resourceful online encyclopaedia, informs that Mr Mbappe was born on Dec. 20, 1998. It also mentions that the French star was only six years old when he joined AS Bondy football academy. Meanwhile, a Punch publication reports how Nigerian singer and songwriter Simi Kosoko, married to Adekunle Gold, celebrated her husband as he clocked 36 in Jan. 2023. By inference, Adekunle Gold is 11 years older than the French star. This means that when Mr Mbappe enrolled in the football academy at AS Bondy at six, Adekunle Gold was 17 years old. A close observation of the image shows the kid identified as the Afrobeats singer does not fit the description of a 17-year-old male. Also, during a 2019 interview session with Punch over his affection for sports, Adekunle Gold acknowledged that he loves football and tennis. He, however, stated that despite his energetic participation in football, he believed his career path was music. Although the Nigerian singer reminisced about his profound support for the Super Eagles in both the 1994 and 1998 World Cup editions, among others, there was no moment he identified himself as a one-time football academy player. Although we contacted Adekunle Gold about the claim, he has yet to respond to our inquiry. The claim is false. Significant details from open-source materials and a newspaper interview reveal that the Afrobeat singer was never a football academy player or a teammate with Mbappe.",0
