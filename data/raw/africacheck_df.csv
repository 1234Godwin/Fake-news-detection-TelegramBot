31-Mar-25,Kenyan president has not asked Nigerian government to return Biafra separatist leader Nnamdi Kanu,Posts on Facebook claim that Kenyan president William Ruto has asked the Nigerian government to return the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra to Kenya. There is no evidence for this claim.,"Kenyan president William Ruto has asked the Nigerian government to return the leader of the  Indigenous People of Biafra   (Ipob),  Nnamdi Kanu, to Kenya. That’s according to a  message  doing the rounds on Facebook . It  reads :  Breaking News: Kenyan President William Kipchirchir Has Requested for Nigeria to Return Nnamdi Kanu to Kenya immediately, Takes Case to World Court. For the first time, Kenya is taking legal action against Nigeria at the World Court over the case of Nnamdi Kanu. President William Kipchirchir has formally requested Nigerian President Bola Tinubu to return Nnamdi Kanu to Kenya, citing concerns over diplomatic security. The Kenyan president expressed fears that foreign diplomats now feel unsafe in his country, stating that if Nnamdi Kanu could be taken from Kenya in such a manner, the same could happen to anyone. President Kipchirchir emphasized that Nigeria’s actions have severely damaged Kenya’s international reputation. He vowed to pursue the case at the highest level to ensure justice and restore his country’s image. The same claim appears  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Kanu is  facing charges  bordering on terrorism and treasonable felony, among others, over his involvement in the agitation for the restoration of  Biafra , a secessionist state that existed between 1967 and 1970.    He was  arrested  in October 2015 and  released on bail  in 2017. He then fled the country after the  Nigerian military raided  his home.  In June 2021, Kanu was  rearrested in Kenya  and extradited to Nigeria to continue his trial. He has remained in the Nigerian government’s custody since then.  But has Ruto demanded that Kanu be returned to Kenya where the Nigerian government picked him up? We checked. No evidence supports the claim     We found no evidence that Ruto made this request. There is no mention of Kanu or Biafra in  Ruto’s recent public communication . There is also no evidence of diplomats in Kenya expressing security concerns due to Kanu’s arrest and extradition from the East African country.  The posts say Kenya has instituted legal action against Nigeria at the “World Court”, perhaps referring to the  International Court of Justice   (ICJ).  But we found no case between Kenya and Nigeria on the  ICJ’s list of cases  nor any related to Kanu’s arrest and extradition. Such a case would have caught the media’s attention. NJC debunks a similar claim Nigeria’s National Judicial Council (NJC) has  debunked a claim  that the country’s chief justice, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, said Kanu should be released and returned to Kenya where he was arrested. A  statement by   the NJC’s deputy director of information, Kemi Ogedengbe, described a media report that made that claim as false.  “There are no court proceedings, decisions or judgments where such statements ascribed to his lordship were made. The council categorically emphasises that the chief justice of Nigeria neither presided over any case of Kanu at the apex court, where jurisdiction issue was argued nor made any such pronouncement. “The chief justice never wrote any formal letter to the Kenya government or Kenya high commission apologising on the issue of arrest of Nnamdi Kanu and trial. The council urges members of the public to disregard the fake story,”  the statement reads . No evidence supports the claim that Ruto asked Nigeria to return Kanu to Kenya. It is false.

24-Mar-25,"No, chairperson of Nigeria’s main opposition PDP hasn’t resigned",Nigeria’s Peoples Democratic Party is experiencing an internal leadership crisis. But the online claim that the party chair has quit is false.,"The  Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party,  has been in crisis  since the 2023 general elections, with growing pressure from governors, party leaders and members to uphold its constitution. Some  party members insist  that acting chair Umar Damagum must step down to allow someone from the  North Central region  to complete the tenure of former chair Iyorchia Ayu,  who was removed  after the 2023 elections. However, several posts on Facebook in Nigeria claim that Damagum has already resigned, with some attributing the information to Arise News, a local television station. Damagum was  appointed  the acting chair in March 2023.  One of the Facebook posts  reads : “Ambassador Umar Damagum has resigned from his position as the acting National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). His resignation aligns with a broader push by PDP governors to increase their influence and guide the party’s future. – Arise News.” The same claim appeared on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here .  (Note: See other instances listed at the end of this report.) But has the acting PDP chairperson resigned? We checked. News of resignation fake  Some of the posts cited Arise news as the source of this information, but our search of the  TV station’s website  found no evidence of such news.  Local media  reported that  Damagum, in a statement by his spokesman Nuru Shehu Jos, denied claims of his resignation, calling them “fake news”. “To set the records straight, the Acting National Chairman, Ambassador Umar Damagun, has not resigned from his office; the PDP constitution affords the National Chairman a term of four years in office, in the first instance,” he was  quoted as saying.   The statement urged members and supporters of the PDP to disregard the claim. A look through the  party's X handle  shows that Damagum has been fulfilling his duty as the leader of the party. Claims that he has resigned are false.  The false claims also appeared  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE
24-Mar-25,No evidence Nigeria’s Enugu state plans to ban popular minibuses and tricycles,Some Facebook posts in Nigeria claim that the Enugu state government is planning to ban tricycles and minibuses by the end of March 2025. But there is no evidence of this.,"Several posts on Facebook in Nigeria claim that the Enugu state government has finalised plans to ban tricycles and minibuses by 30 March 2025.  Enugu  is in the south-east of Nigeria. Tricycles and minibuses are popular means of transport in the state. One of the Facebook posts  reads : “Starting March 30, 2025, Enugu bans Keke and minibuses from major roads as part of a modernization plan. BRT buses will replace them, with free fares for secondary students and subsidies for tertiary students.” A keke is a tricycle. BRT refers to bus rapid transit. The same claim also appeared on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But has the state government announced a ban on three-wheelers and minibuses in the state? We checked. No evidence of the claim We found no evidence of an imminent ban on the state government’s  official website . The local media widely reported on a   previous ban  on minibuses and tricycles. However, we found no 2025 reports in credible media outlets about another ban, which would be the case if it were true. There is no evidence that the Enugu state government will ban tricycles and minibuses in the state by the end of March. The false claim also appeared  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE
27-Mar-25,Nigeria’s former president Obasanjo did not advise suspended Rivers state governor to declare state of emergency,Several Facebook posts claim that former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo told governor Siminalayi Fubara to declare a state of emergency in Rivers state. But the state government and the former president have denied this claim.,"Nigeria’s former president  Olusegun Obasanjo  visited the suspended Rivers state governor,  Siminalayi Fubara , and advised him on how to handle the political crisis in the state. This is  according  to  several   posts  on social  media . An 18 March 2025 post  reads , in part: “Shutdown Rivers Assembly. Declare State of Emergency in Rivers State  –  #Obasanjo Visits SIM #Fubara.” According to the post, Obasanjo told Fubara: “ Shutdown Rivers Assembly. Declare State of Emergency in Rivers State …  You are the governor, elected by the people. You are the Chief Security Officer of #RiversState. What you order stands—neither Tinubu nor Wike put you in power. Demolish any hall or arena set to host your impeachment. Tinubu needs Rivers votes to win the 2027 election, and you stand in his way.” Obasanjo was president of Nigeria from 1999 to 2007.  Rivers state  is located in the southern part of the country.  The political instability in the state started in 2023 when Fubara  fell out  with his predecessor,  Nyesom Wike . Fubara was elected governor in March 2023. A few months later, lawmakers loyal to Wike initiated  impeachment proceedings  against him. While the proceedings were later  withdrawn , this led to a major political  crisis . In March 2025, Fubara lost his  court bid  to dismiss pro-Wike lawmakers. Since then, calls for his  resignation  or impeachment have intensified. Things took a dramatic turn on 18 March when Nigerian president Bola Tinubu  announced  a state of emergency in the state and suspended Fubara, his deputy and the state’s house of assembly. The same  claim  can be found  here ,  here  and  here . But did Obasanjo,  a vocal critic  of Tinubu’s administration, tell Fubara to declare a state of emergency in Rivers and fight for his position as governor? We checked. Rivers state government debunks claim The political crisis in the state has been making headlines since it started. If Obasanjo had visited Fubara, the media would have reported on it. But we found no credible reports on such a development. This is a sign that the claim might be false. On 18 March, Nelson Chukwudi, the governor's chief press secretary,   released a statement   debunking the claim.  Part of the statement reads: “There is also another planted by some people bent on causing chaos and anarchy in the State, alleging that former President Olusegun Obasanjo, paid a visit to the Governor in Government House, Port Harcourt. Ordinarily, we would not have responded to these spurious claims and obvious fake news on social media, but … let it be clarified that there was no such visit by any delegation of PANDEF to Governor Fubara on the said date, neither did Chief Obasanjo visit him as claimed by our detractors.” Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo’s media aide, also told the media that the claim was  false .",FALSE
14-Mar-25,"No, HIV-positive patients in Nigeria won’t have to pay N30 million per month for treatment",US president Donald Trump’s decision to temporarily freeze all US foreign assistance has affected many programmes across the world. But the claim that HIV medication will cost N30 million a month in Nigeria unless Trump changes his mind is false.,"Donald Trump  was  sworn in  as president of the United States for the second time on 20 January 2025. Since then, he has  signed  many  executive orders , most of them affecting humanitarian efforts and immigration. An executive order is a  legislative tool  that allows a US president to issue legally binding orders to the federal government. On his inauguration day, Trump signed an order titled  Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid . In this executive order, he called for a 90-day pause on new foreign aid commitments and disbursements pending a review of all foreign aid programmes. This order also affected the  President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief  (Pepfar), which has been instrumental in providing  human immunodeficiency virus  (HIV) treatment and prevention services across Africa.  HIV is a virus that  attacks  and weakens the body’s immune system.  Antiretroviral drugs ,  or ARVs, help treat HIV by stopping the virus from spreading in the body. If people infected with the virus don’t get treatment, they could develop the potentially fatal   acquired immunodeficiency syndrome , or  Aids. Nigeria has been a  major beneficiary  of funding for the treatment and prevention of HIV from the US, mainly through Pepfar. In this context, a Facebook  post  claims that HIV-positive patients in Nigeria will spend N30 million (about US$20,019) monthly to afford medication. Part of the  31 January 2025 post  reads: “ HIV Patients in Nigeria will now spend 30 million Naira monthly to afford drugs if Trump does not change his mind …  90% of Nigerians will not be able to afford it. With Trump cutting funding for free HIV treatment and other HIV programs, the disease will spread like wild fire. Discipline yourself and save your life.” The same claim appears  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But is this true? We checked. ‘Treatment remains free’ says Nigerian agency On 27 February, Nigeria’s  National Agency for the Control of AIDS  debunked a  similar post  claiming HIV medication would cost N250,000 per dose, with patients required to pay N500,000 monthly. The agency  said : “HIV treatment in Nigeria remains free of charge at Government owned health facilities. The Government in collaboration with donor partners remains steadfast in providing free and accessible HIV treatment to all who need it.” To mitigate the impact of the frozen US aid, the Nigerian federal executive council   approved   contracts worth N10.3 billion (almost US$7 million) on 5 March to procure essential medical supplies, including   ARVs . There are no reports from credible media outlets to support the claim that HIV-positive patients will each have to pay N30 million per month for treatment. If this were true, it would have received wide media coverage. Similar claims were found  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE
14-Mar-25,"No, US president Donald Trump has not sanctioned Nigeria or ordered closure of US embassy in the country",There is no evidence to support the claim that,"Some Facebook  posts claim  that United States president Donald Trump has imposed sanctions on Nigeria, cut business ties and ordered the closure of the US embassy in the country.  Part of one  post, dated 9 March 2025,  reads :  “U.S. President Donald Trump has announced sweeping sanctions on Nigeria, citing concerns over the legitimacy of the country’s last presidential election.” The post also quotes Trump as saying:  I’ve received countless reports—very serious reports—saying that the current president of Nigeria is not the person the people really voted for. It’s a disgrace. It’s terrible. This kind of election fraud would have never happened if I were president at the time. I would have made sure of that. We’re not going to stand by and watch this happen. I am sanctioning Nigeria, blocking their access to international trade, and cutting business ties with the U.S. until things are done the right way. Nigeria deserves better. The people of Nigeria deserve better.   The same claim appears  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Bola Tinubu  emerged  victorious  in Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election. Some opposition parties  challenged  the election results in court, citing irregularities. But the country's supreme court later  upheld  Tinubu’s victory. Since his inauguration as the  47th president  of the US, Trump has signed dozens of  executive orders , and imposed  sanctions  and new tariffs on goods from various countries.  When a country is   sanctioned , trade is restricted or stopped altogether in an  attempt to penalise   the country for failing to comply with international laws.  So, has  Trump imposed sanctions on Nigeria and ordered the closure of the US embassy in the country? We checked. No evidence to support this Since Trump took office in January 2025, his administration’s  activities   have consistently made headlines, especially those   concerning international relations . Recent diplomatic rows between the US and countries such as   South Africa   and   Colombia   have received wide media coverage. It’s unlikely that Trump would impose sanctions on Nigeria, and the media hasn’t reported on it. Also, there is no evidence of a disruption of activities at the   US embassy and consulate in Nigeria .  The embassy’s   website   and   X account   show it has been busy.    No evidence supports the claim. It is false. The false claim was also posted  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE
28-Feb-25,"No, Nigerian singer Davido was not arrested in Abuja for threatening police chief and attempted murder",Multiple Facebook posts claim that Nigerian artist Davido has been arrested in Abuja for attempted murder and threatening a police chief. The claim is false.,"Singer David Adeleke, better known as Davido, has been arrested in the Nigerian capital of Abuja for attempted murder and threatening the police chief in Osun state. That’s according to a   post  published on a public   Facebook group  with over 94,600 members . Osun state is in southwest Nigeria. “Breaking: Davido Arrested in Abuja Over Alleged Threat to Osun State IG, Faces Transfer to Prison for Attempted Murder,”  the  post reads . The post links to an  article  that claims: “Davido was taken into custody late Tuesday evening at a private residence in Abuja. Authorities claim that the arrest was based on credible intelligence suggesting that the singer had made violent threats against the Osun State IG during a heated dispute .”  The same claim can also be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Osun state politics The post uses the acronym “IG”, which refers to the  inspector general of police , the overall head of the Nigerian police. The police chief in Osun state is the commissioner of police , Mohammed Abba.  Davido’s uncle Ademola Adeleke is the governor of Osun state. Davido made a series of  strong-worded comments  on social media about a  political crisis  over local governments in the state. Shortly before leaving office as Osun state governor in 2022, Adegboyega Oyetola  conducted local government elections , which candidates of his party, the All Progressives Congress, won.  However, a  court ruling  removed the local government officials before Adeleke of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) took office and set up caretaker committees to run the local councils.  A court of appeal  ruling  on 10 February 2025 nullified the 2022 ruling that sacked the local council officials. However, the state government  went ahead  with the local government election on 22 February 2025. The  PDP won  in all 30 local government areas.   In a press conference,  Adeleke accused Oyetola  of using the heads of security agencies in the state, including Abba, to  forcefully reinstate  the sacked local council officials. Adeleke claims security agents take orders from Oyetola because he is president Bola Tinubu’s  nephew . Davido  criticised and insulted  Abba on the social media platform X.  In one tweet, Davido  wrote : “Mr Umar abba osun state  commissioner u are a disgrace to ur children !! !!! Game on  FUCKER  !!!! All of us go mad together !! Werey.” In another post, Davido  said : “Mr commissioner respect the rule of law!!! You are not madder or crazier than us !! Make we all kuku mad !! MEN MOUNT WALAI TO KRF!!! I will post u everyday everywhere Mr man !!! Try me  fucker .” Was Davido arrested for tweeting these and more? We checked.   No evidence of the claim Davido, a Grammy nominated singer, has  16.4 million followers  on X and  29.4 million on Instagram .  If he was indeed arrested for threatening a police chief or attempted murder, it would’ve made headlines.  We found multiple news reports on Davido’s comments on the Osun political crisis but no mention of him getting arrested. Such selective media coverage is unlikely.   Davido apologised and praised Abba Later, in a series of tweets titled  My Take on Osun CP, NPF and Forthcoming LG Elections , Davido  noted  that he initially failed to  recognise the efforts of Abba and other security agents to keep Osun state peaceful amid the crisis. There is no evidence of the Nigerian police arresting or pressing charges against Davido. The claim is false. The false claim was also posted  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE

There is no evidence of this.,"Former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo said  the food blockage supposedly initiated by then federal commissioner for finance  Obafemi Awolowo  was key to ending the  Nigerian civil war . This is according to  a  post  on  a  public Facebook group  with over 94,600 members . The  post reads :  “ Breaking News: Awolowo’s Food Blockade Was Key to Ending the War – Igbo Soldiers Were Unstoppable – Obasanjo. ”  The claim can also be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Nigeria’s eastern region seceded, declaring independence as the  Republic of Biafra  on 30 May 1967.  This led to a  civil war  that ended in January 1970 and had a death toll  estimated at  between 500,000 and 3 million . The Biafrans were predominantly of the Igbo ethnic group. Obasanjo  headed a commando division  during the war. He later became  military head of state of Nigeria  from 1976 to 1979  and the country’s democratically elected president  from 1999 to 2007 .  Nigerian troops  captured  the coastal city of Port-Harcourt in May 1968  and blocked Biafra’s access to food and other relief materials. It’s estimated that hundreds of thousands of  Biafrans starved to death , including women and children. Awolowo was accused of masterminding the blockade. However, there is  evidence that  the leader of Biafra at the time, Colonel  Odumegwu Ojukwu ,  refused to accept  the Nigerian government’s conditions for allowing the supplies.  Did  Obasanjo make public statements about the blockade and its impact on the civil war in 2025? We checked.  No evidence of the claim On 20 February 2025, another former Nigerian military head of state  Ibrahim Babangida   launched  his  book  A Journey in Service. Since then, Nigerians have debated  historical events , including the civil war and the annulled 1993 presidential election.  We found no evidence of the claim or a credible media report on Obasanjo speaking about the civil war.  It’s unlikely that such a claim by Obasanjo would go unreported by the media. The same claim  generated much debate  when it was made in the book  There Was a Country  by Chinua Achebe, published in 2012.  The  claim that  Obasanjo made the statement about the blockade in 2025 is false.  The false claim was also posted  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .",FALSE

Ignore social media posts claiming otherwise.,"Several Facebook  posts  attribute a shocking  quote  to Prof  Mojisola Adeyeye , the director general of Nigeria’s  National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control  (Nafdac). The posts quote her as  saying : “95% of drug counterfeiting in Nigeria is done at Aba and Onitsha.” They feature an image of her being interviewed by  Channels TV  anchor  Seun Okinbaloye  on his political programme, Sunday Politics. The posts imply that Adeyeye made the statement during her interview with Okinbaloye. Aba  is a large  industrial  city in Abia state, and  Onitsha  is a  port and  market  town  in Anambra state, southeastern Nigeria . Both  play a significant role in the country's economy and culture. Nafdac is a government agency that oversees the safety, quality and efficacy of food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, chemicals, and packaged water. The agency has conducted  several raids  in the southeast since the start of 2025, confiscating  substandard and expired drugs  and  shutting down  some markets.  The same claim can be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But did Adeyeye make such a statement? We checked. No proof of statement The  interview  referenced in the posts was uploaded on Channels TV’s  YouTube page  on 17 February 2025.  In it, Adeyeye spoke about Nafdac’s raids on some markets and the manufacturing of fake drugs in the country. In response to  Okinbaloye’s question  about where the fake and unregistered drugs were coming from, Adeyeye  said  most of them were imported. “Most of the [fake] drugs are being brought into the country … Most of the substandard or falsified drugs that are coming in, the volume is huge. The ones that we’ve seen in Aba, Osisioma area and the ones that we’ve seen in Onitsha are not from local manufacturers. They are being brought in through porous borders and through the ports.” She never said 95% of drug counterfeiting in Nigeria was done in Aba and Onitsha, as claimed online.

They wanted you all dead for the sake of power. I resigned so that you could live. They were not after me; they were after you. I just happened to be standing in their way. They knew I would bring Nigeria to global standards, so they fought me from all sides, dragging you into the depths of poverty. My love for you as Nigerians was beyond words.

Nigeria’s 2015 election In February 2025, US lawmaker Scott Perry  claimed that  the  United States Agency for International Development   (USAid) funded the activities of terror groups, including  Boko Haram .  The claim revived debates about the US government’s  interference  in Nigeria’s 2015 presidential election. Jonathan of the  Peoples Democratic Party  lost  the election  to Muhammadu Buhari of the  All Progressives Congress  (APC).  Some said Perry’s claim proved that  Barack Obama ’s administration helped the opposition defeat Jonathan, a claim the former Nigerian president  made  in his 2018 book  My Transition Hours . They also pointed at the Obama administration’s  refusal to sell weapons  to Jonathan’s government at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency,  Obama’s associates consulting for the APC  ahead of the election, and  Obama’s video  urging Nigerians to vote for the “next chapter” in the country’s progress. The US ambassador in Nigeria, Richard Mills,  has refuted Perry’s claim  that USAid funded Boko Haram.   However, did Jonathan say those he was up against in 2015 wanted all Nigerians dead? We checked. No hint of the claim Jonathan was  in the news   multiple times  in February 2025. We looked at his  speeches  at  various public events  in the past month and found no mention of the 2015 elections or the events leading to it.  Considering Jonathan’s status and the popular notion that he was a victim of US interference in Nigerian politics, it would have been well reported in the media if he had made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook posts.   We found no credible media report on this.  The  claim is false.",FALSE

One  video shows what appear to be US soldiers jumping out of a helicopter alongside images of Malanga in handcuffs. Another image shows a court hearing of those accused of plotting the coup.  Another  video appears to show US troops being received at an airport by Congolese leaders and soldiers.

The videos consist of several short clips of different scenes of military operations and use misleading subtitles to create a false narrative. One of the scenes, showing soldiers jumping from a helicopter, has  been online  for years and is not linked to any US operation in the DRC.  The clip of a large US Air Force plane unloading troops and vehicles is also from several previous military operations in   different locations , not the DRC. Similarly, the video of soldiers being received at an airport is from December 2024 and shows  Belgian troops  in the DRC to   evaluate a military training centre . There has been no official announcement by the US or the Congolese government regarding any US military deployment to the DRC for such a mission. Malanga and his associates were tried and  sentenced  in Congo.  There are no credible reports or reliable expectations that they will be charged in the US. The US ambassador to Congo  has pledged  to cooperate fully with the DRC authorities in the investigation. The claim that the US military went to the DRC to rescue Marcel Malanga and his associates is false.",FALSE

The video circulating on social media is not proof of any French deployment.,"French soldiers have been deployed to Maiduguri in Borno, a northeastern state in Nigeria, to help fight against Boko Haram. This is according to several posts on Facebook. Boko Haram  is a terrorist organisation responsible for numerous attacks on civilians, schools and government facilities, as well as kidnappings. These include the  widely reported  abduction of schoolgirls in  Chibok , also in Borno state, in 2014. One  post , published 16 December 2024, is headlined: “END OF DENIAL: COMMENCEMENT OF FRANCE MILITARY DEPLOYMENT IN NIGERIA.” The post features a video of a soldier speaking to the media in Hausa, the language predominantly spoken in the northern part of Nigeria. A white man in military fatigues and cap stands beside the Hausa-speaking soldier. Part of the post reads: “Yesterday, the Chief of Army staff received the first contingent of French soldiers and immediately deployed them to maiduguri to ‘HELP NIGERIA IN FIGHTING BOKO HARAM’ . The same boko haram they claimed to have decimated and are scamping  for safety.” During his address on  Nigeria's Independence Day  on 1 October, president Bola Tinubu said that the government had “eliminated” Boko Haram and bandit commanders faster than ever,  over 300  at last count. Furthermore, in an effort to  deepen economic  ties with France, Tinubu visited French president  Emmanuel Macron  in November 2024,  sparking rumours  on social media. The post questions the genuineness of the president's assertion about eliminating Boko Haram and claims that the Nigerian army chief has received French soldiers to be deployed to Maiduguri. Similar posts can be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But does the video show French soldiers' deployed in Maiduguri? We checked. ‘False claim’ On 16 December, the  Nigerian army denied  the claim, saying that no plan was underway to establish a French military base in the northeast. The army explained that the video was from another event on 25 October at which Brig Gen Abubakar Haruna addressed the press alongside a member of the  British Military Advisory Training Team . Using keywords from the statement, Africa Check found a  longer version of the video  on the  News Central TV  page on YouTube, posted on 27 October.

Several credible media organisations in Nigeria reported the announcement, and we would expect the same for the so-called Christmas package and grants. But we found no reports on this, which was the first red flag. We noticed that the posts lacked crucial information, such as the closing date for applications and who was eligible for the “packages”. Government initiatives usually include all the essential information and do not confuse users. The   link  accompanying the “Christmas package” posts led us to a webpage that said: “Application Ends This Month.” Clicking on the “apply now” button led us to a blog post about visa sponsorship opportunities in the US.  The  same  goes for the other  posts  with different giveaway  amounts . Their  links  also  lead  to blog  posts  about visa sponsorship opportunities. If the giveaways were indeed from the Nigerian government, the links would’ve taken us to official government websites.  This is called engagement bait, a tactic used on social media to encourage users to interact with content in ways that artificially boost its visibility.

On 10 September, heavy rains caused the  Alau Dam  to burst, devastating the city and surrounding areas. The floods caused widespread damage to homes and infrastructure and affected almost  400,000  people.

The Instagram account  northern_khartoumstudents  also  posted  the same image. Khartoum is the capital of  Sudan , a country in northeastern Africa.  A closer look at the cash also confirms our suspicion, as some of the bank notes  appear  to be Sudanese £1,000 and  £100  notes.

Nigeria is rich. Nigerians are poor. They are poor because of the wickedness of their leaders,” the  post  said, adding that in less than two years, the Nigerian government had bought a yacht, planes and built a multi-billion naira residence for the vice president. Nigeria’s vice president is  Kashim Shettima . The post  includes  a video of a large yacht sailing past what appears to be a dock. A flag that looks like the  flag of Nigeria  can be seen flying from the top of the yacht. President Bola Tinubu was  sworn in  on 29 May 2023. His term has been buffeted by a major  economic crisis . This has been compounded by an  increase in the price of petrol  in September 2024,  leading to further tensions among Nigerians. In November 2023, many Nigerians  rejected  the government's plan to buy a presidential yacht for US$6 million. But Tinubu still went ahead with the  purchase , which included sport utility vehicles for Nigerian lawmakers. The video of the yacht was posted with the same claim  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But does the yacht in the video belong to the Nigerian government? We checked. Claim is false On 7 September 2024 Otega Ogra,  senior special assistant to Tinubu,   debunked the claim on X  (formerly Twitter). “There have been false claims circulating that a private individual's yacht spotted in St. Tropez is a Nigerian government yacht. The 42m Bennetti yacht currently being shared online has been privately owned for around 5 years since it was constructed,” Ogra also  posted .

Symptoms  include bright red blood after a bowel movement, lumps around the anus and the feeling of needing to poo.

Organised criminals, known locally as bandits,  have plagued  northwestern and central Nigeria for years. A 2021  BBC report describes  the problem: “Gangs on motorbikes terrorise the region, stealing animals, kidnapping for ransom, killing anyone who dares confront them and taxing farmers – it's a huge money-making operation.” There was an escalation of violent attacks and kidnapping by bandits in Sokoto state in August 2024.  There are media  reports of bandits kidnapping about 150 people  and rustling over 1,000 cattle in some villages in the Gobir emirate of Sokoto state, days after  killing the local emir .  An   emir  is an Islamic military commander, governor of a province, or a high military official. President Bola Tinubu  has directed  the defence minister and military chief to relocate to Sokoto to  “ flush out the bandits ”. There have been no credible media reports that any of the kidnapped people have been killed. Africa Check did a reverse image search of screenshots from the video, which led to a number of results, including  a report  in a  Sudanese newspaper  written in Arabic.  We used Google Translate to translate the report into English. It  stated that the video  had been falsely attributed to events in Sudan but the newspaper’s investigations showed the event occurred in Burkina Faso.

This led us to  a Reuters report  of hundreds killed in north-central Burkina Faso on 27 August after ""suspected jihadists opened fire on them as they were digging trenches around a town to protect it from attacks."" We also found  a YouTube video report  by Reuters about the killing in Burkina Faso, which includes the video in question.

He grinds the cuttlebone into a powder and slightly crushes the watermelon before mixing the two.  The video has been viewed over 248,000 times with 900 comments. High blood pressure , or hypertension, occurs when the force of the blood against the  artery walls  is consistently too high, causing the heart to work harder.

Watermelon  is a juicy fruit from a plant in the gourd family, originally from tropical Africa and now grown all over the world. It contains vitamins A and C and is usually eaten raw. The  Merriam-Webster  dictionary defines  cuttlebone  as “the shell of a cuttlefish that is sometimes used for polishing powder or for supplying cage birds with lime and salts”.  Cuttlefish  live in shallow tropical or temperate coastal waters. The video claiming this watermelon-cuttlebone mixture can cure high blood pressure has been posted  here ,  here  and  here .

But the claim is false, and the video used as evidence was taken from her speech at a climate conference.","Part of a  message  doing the rounds on social media reads: “John Kerry’s Daughter Says BILLIONS of Humans Must Die for the ‘New World Order’ 1 of 2. John Kerry’s daughter Vanessa has celebrated her promotion to the World Economic Forum’s board of Agenda Contributors by urging the elitist organization to transform itself into a world government and seize total control of humanity …”  Vanessa Kerry  is the daughter of former US senator  John Kerry . She is a  climate change activist  and co-founder of  Seed Global Health , a nonprofit organisation dedicated to training and supporting health workers in  sub-Saharan Africa . In June 2023, Kerry was  appointed  special envoy for climate change and health for the  World Health Organization   (WHO). The “ New World Order ” is a term often used by conspiracy theorists to describe a period of dramatic change in the world of politics, specifically the implementation of a “totalitarian  one-world  government”. The  message  also says: “According to Vanessa Kerry, the time is ripe for a globalist coup d’etat which utilises the control mechanisms in the World Health Organization’s pandemic treaty to create a world government that answers to nobody.” The pandemic treaty, also known as the   pandemic agreement   or pandemic accord, has been   negotiated   by the   WHO’s   194 member states  for over two years. Its   aim  is to   “prevent, prepare for and respond to pandemics”. The   treaty  was  needed  because of the world’s lack of preparation for the global outbreak of   Covid-19  and the poor cooperation between countries during the pandemic. Other  versions  of the claim include a video of Kerry talking about climate change and how it's affecting the human race. Similar posts can be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But did Kerry make such a statement? We checked. No evidence Kerry said any such thing The statement attributed to Kerry is controversial and would likely have made international headlines.

In the  video  of her talking about climate change, she doesn’t say anything about “billions of people having to die for a New World Order”. The commentator makes this comment and it is repeated in other posts making this claim.

One post  reads , in part: “This same fvcking clown was at the street of Abuja and the eagles square protesting against Jonathan government when fuel was #100 and bag of rice was 7k but it got to his tribe man turn he’s saying we should call God?” Goodluck Jonathan  served as the president of Nigeria from 2010 to 2015. Tinubu was  sworn in  on 29 May 2023, succeeding  Muhammadu Buhari . According to the  post , Adeboye was deliberately silent because he and Tinubu are from the Yoruba ethnic group, while Jonathan is Igbo.  Nigeria is facing its  worst economic crisis  in decades, which has led to an increase in fuel and food  prices . There have also been  protests  in some states against the rising cost of living under Tinubu. The claim started circulating after popular Nigerian singer  Eedris Abdulkareem  called out Adeboye in one of his songs. Abdulkareem  said : “Pastor Adeboye, during Goodluck Jonathan, your voice was so loud. You even vowed to stage a one million-man march, hunger and hardship under Tinubu government, you say Nigeria get spiritual problem.” Other versions of the  claim  feature  a photo  of Adeboye holding a placard.

The walk was also covered by other  news agencies , featuring photos of Adeboye holding the same placard. We searched Google, using keywords from the claim, to find reports of Adeboye protesting during Jonathan’s tenure. We found a  Vanguard  news  article  from 2010 that said Adeboye had sent a petition to Jonathan over the spate of kidnappings in the country.

Nigerians had also  decried  the hike.  Headquartered in South Africa,  MultiChoice  operates  DStv , a major satellite television service, in several countries including  Nigeria ,  Malawi  and  Namibia . On 29 April, Nigeria’s Competition and Consumer Protection Commission  restrained  the company from increasing its subscription prices following the April price review. The commission  ordered  MultiChoice not to implement the price adjustments, which were due to start on 1 May. On 7 June, the court  ordered the company  to pay N150 million (about US$100,000) for non-compliance and to offer Nigerian customers a one-month free subscription to the DStv and GOtv packages. The company  told local media  that it would appeal the court’s ruling.  However, several reports on Facebook in Nigeria claim that the company has begun reviewing its subscriptions to make them cheaper.

Negotiations between the government and the unions are still ongoing.","Nigerian unions  suspended  a national strike that  began on 3 June 2024  after the government said it was open to a new minimum wage of more than N60,000 per month. The current minimum wage is  N57,000  ( about US$38 ), with the unions initially demanding N497,000 per month.   At a meeting with organised labour on 4 June, president Bola Tinubu ordered finance minister Wale Edun to present the cost implications of a new minimum wage within two days.     In this context, posts on Facebook  claim that  Edun has submitted a proposal for a new national minimum wage of N105,000 – almost double the current level. The government  has offered  up to N62,000, while the unions have gone down to  N250,000 . Did the government offer a minimum wage almost double the current one? We checked. The presidency and the trade unions deny the figure In response to the viral claim, presidential aide Bayo Onanuga  refuted it  on his account on X (formerly Twitter).  “The Honourable Minister of Finance and Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Wale Edun, has not proposed N105,000 minimum wage. The contrary story being disseminated is false,”  he wrote  on 6 June.  The president of the Nigeria Labour Congress Joe Ajaero also  denied the claim . He told journalists that no new figure had been presented to the   Minimum Wage Tripartite Committee , which comprises representatives of the federal government, the organised private sector and the unions. To cast further doubt on the figure, the country’s state governors say that even the  N60,000 minimum wage is unsustainable . They said state governments could not afford to pay that much. It is highly unlikely that the finance minister would then have offered the even higher sum of N105,000. The minimum wage is a sensitive issue in Nigeria.

9-Apr-24,Ignore claims of ‘Ramadan seasonal gifts’ from Nigerian mobile money operator OPay,"Some social media users have claimed that OPay is offering “N5,000 gifts” to its Nigerian customers to celebrate the holy month of Ramadan. However, a representative of the company has denied the claims.","Several   posts  on Facebook claim that  OPay  is giving away N5,000 (about US$4) Ramadan seasonal gifts to its customers in Nigeria. OPay is  a mobile-based financial services provider . One post, dated 1 April 2024,  reads : “Hurry now and get your OPay ₦5,000 Ramadan Gift. Click on the message down below the post to send Account Number.” On 11 March 2024, Muslims around the world began observing the holy month of Ramadan, a period of fasting. During this month, friends and family often exchange gifts to celebrate.  Companies  also  give gifts  to support and strengthen their relationship with Muslim customers.

False claim Africa Checked searched for news about the company giving away money to celebrate Ramadan, but came up empty. This is a red flag. The site  linked  to in some of the posts was no longer accessible at the time of publication. It’s also suspicious that a company as big as OPay would ask people to contact them via WhatsApp, as the other posts claim. Such promotions are usually run through the company’s official website. We scoured OPay’s social media pages, including  Facebook  and  X (formerly Twitter) , and found that it had never offered a giveaway to mark the holy month. The only Ramadan-related  post  is a greeting to Muslims on 11 March. We contacted OPAy on X to find out if they ran such a promotion.  A company representative said: “Kindly ignore such posts as OPay is not giving out any cash prizes or doing any giveaways for Ramadan.""",FALSE

12-Apr-24,"Ignore social media claims that the US dollar was selling at N1,000 on Nigeria’s unofficial ‘parallel’ exchange market","The Nigerian naira has strengthened against the dollar on the unregulated market after months of depreciation. But users claiming the naira was trading at N1,000 to the dollar on 27 March in Abuja are incorrect.","“This morning at Zone 4 Abuja, along the Sheraton Hotel, the dollar is selling at N1,000 - $1. Abdulsalam BDC is selling N900 if buying over $5000,” reads  a Facebook post  published 27 March 2024. The post  says there is a rush to sell dollars at Wuse, Zone 4 in Abuja and adds that dollars are selling at a lower price in the parallel market than the official market. The Nigerian currency has  continued its rise  against the dollar after several months of falling into historic lows,  trading at N1,851  to the US dollar on 23 February 2024.  It was reported  that the naira rose to N1,340 per dollar in late March on the  parallel market .  The parallel market is an  unofficial market  where foreign exchange transactions are made outside the formal channels established by a government. As a result of the naira appreciation, some social media users have claimed that the dollar was selling as low as N1,000 at the end of March. Similar posts can be found  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  But did the naira appreciate to N1,000 to the dollar? We checked. According to  Punch newspaper , bureau de change (BDC) operators, people who  exchange foreign  currency for profits, said the dollar exchanged at N1,300 to the dollar at the parallel market on 27 March. One BDC operator was  quoted  as saying: “Dollar is selling at N1300/$1, not N1000 or N900.” Several  other  news sites  reported the same.  On 26 March,  Punch reported  that the central bank allocated US$10,000 to each BDC operator at N1,251 per dollar. The central bank reportedly told the operators to sell dollars at a rate not exceeding 1.5% above the purchase price, bringing the exchange to N1,269 per dollar. This implies that selling below the purchasing price from the government at N1,000 per dollar would lead to a loss. However, on 8 April the central bank  crashed the dollar  rate by releasing US$10,000 at the rate of N1,101 to the BDC operators. This implies that the BDC should not sell above N1,117.50 to the dollar, which is 1.5% of the apex bank’s directive. Reports  of the parallel rate  going for N1,300 per dollar were from March, while the price changed in  early April , selling at  N1,278.58 at the parallel rate and  selling  above N1,000  as of 12 April. While the naira has appreciated against the dollar in the parallel market, the claims of it selling at N1,000 per dollar anywhere in Nigeria are, at time of publication, false. The viral claims could lead to Nigerians making financial decisions that could potentially lead to losses. Fact-checking ensures that decisions are made based on truth and not misinformation.",FALSE

Beware of scam! In 2022, the federal government  launched a portal  for education students to apply for bursaries. The then education minister Adamu Adamu announced that undergraduate students in public universities studying education would receive N75,000 per semester, while college students would get N50,000. This  initiative aligned  with former president Muhammadu Buhari's commitment to education reform, as announced during the 2021 World Teachers' Day celebration in Abuja, the country’s capital . But the application period for those funds has lapsed and the website administering the bursaries is  no longer  functional.  Africa Check didn’t find any media reports from credible sources that confirmed the number of beneficiaries or the figures quoted for 2024 in the viral message.

28-Feb-24,"No, this Israeli fighter jet wasn't spotted over Nigeria's capital during Hamas leaders’ visit","Leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas were in Abuja, Nigeria’s federal capital city, in February 2024. Facebook posts claim that an Israeli bomber jet was spotted over the city at the time, but there is no evidence for this.","“Breaking News: Israeli Bomber Jet Spotted Over Abuja Following Sighting of Hamas Leader in Nigeria's Capital,”  reads a Facebook post  from February 2024.  The  post  continues: “Tensions escalated in Abuja as reports emerged of an Israeli Bomber Jet flying across the city following the sighting of the leader of the Hamas wanted group in the Nigerian capital. The presence of the jet in the skies above Abuja has raised concerns about potential military actions or security threats in the region.” The post links to an  article  with an identical “breaking news” headline.   Many Nigerians expressed concerns over the visit of senior Hamas officials to Abuja in February 2024. One of them,  Ghazi Hamad , is  known as a spokesperson for Hamas , and gave a  few media   interviews  on the  Israeli war against Gaza . The Islamist militant movement  Hamas  has ruled the  Gaza Strip  since 2005. It attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 from Gaza,  killing over 1,200  and kidnapping more than 240 people. This led to Israel declaring war against Hamas, centred on Gaza.  Over 29,000  Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks by February 2024, according to the  Gaza health ministry . More than 7,000 people are  also missing , presumed dead.        The war  has divided the world . Some countries side with Israel’s offensive in Gaza while others are against it. Some countries, including Nigeria, have  stayed neutral . Nigeria is among the  countries that called for a ceasefire  and was in a delegation of the  Organisation of Islamic Cooperation  and the  Arab League , which sought to stop the war. The  Facebook post in question  includes a link to the  report  and two photos. The  first photo  is of an  F-16 fighter jet . The  second photo  shows the Hamas delegation with two unidentified Nigerians. We found the same post, report and photos on Facebook  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But was an Israeli fighter jet seen over Abuja after Hamas officials visited? A reverse image search of the photo of the fighter jet led to  a media report dated  23 February 2017. The  report is about  an Israel Air Force fighter jet shooting down a Hamas drone from Gaza before it entered Israel. The photo is  credited to AFP .  Results from a reverse image search on the second photo were mostly from social posts made in mid-February 2024.  “A Hamas delegation led by Ghazi Hamad, Sami Abu Zuhri, and A. Ali Baraka just completed a 4-day visit to Nigeria and met with government officials and civil society,” a 15 February 2024  post on X describes the photo . This description aligns with  a report  on  Critical Threats , a project of the  American Enterprise Institute .  The project   analyses intelligence  on unclassified information to assess threats to the US and its allies. The  US is Israel’s largest ally .  The  report says  the Hamas delegation visited Nigeria as part of the group’s  diplomatic outreach to friendly African countries  to increase international support. Neither photo is evidence that an “I sraeli Bomber Jet [was] Spotted Over Abuja”. We found no other credible media reports of tension in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, after the visit by Hamas officials or any news that an Israeli fighter jet had been sighted.  Such would have been widely reported, considering its implications on global politics, diplomatic ties between both countries and the safety of residents in Abuja.  The claim is false and should be disregarded.",FALSE
28-Mar-24,No evidence that 500 Nigerian military officers of Igbo ethnicity resigned in protest against president Bola Tinubu,An old claim about 500 Igbo military officers resigning over lack of confidence in Bola Tinubu as commander-in-chief has resurfaced. But there is still no evidence for it.,"In March 2024 a  message circulated on Facebook , claiming that 500 Nigerian military officers from the Igbo ethnic group had resigned after passing a vote of no confidence in president Bola Tinubu. The claim is  circulating as a screenshot  of a breaking news report and  as Facebook posts .  “Breaking news: 500 Igbo military officers resign from Nigeria's military, passed a vote of no confidence for Tinubu as president,”  the headline of the screenshot reads . The claim also appears  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . The  Igbo  are from Nigeria’s southeast region, which seceded from Nigeria in 1967 to form a sovereign state called the  Republic of Biafra . The state collapsed after a  30-month civil war . In the  Nigerian military , the term “military officer” is used for  commissioned officers  in the army who have senior ranks from second lieutenant to field marshal. They are usually  graduates of military academies .  According to the  Nigerian Armed Forces Act , an officer can only resign after obtaining permission.  “All promotions, retirements, resignations and dismissals of an officer from any of the services of the Armed Forces shall be published in the Gazette,”  section 24 of the act reads .  The act also says that expressing a lack of confidence in the president, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, could be interpreted as mutiny or insubordination. The offenders could  face imprisonment if convicted  by a court-martial. Considering this, have 500 military staff of Igbo origin really resigned because they don’t have confidence in Tinubu? We investigated. Old claim, no evidence We found that the claim first circulated in May 2023, days before Tinubu was sworn in as president.  Examples of the claim made in May 2023 on Facebook can be seen  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But there was no credible evidence of this then.  The  resignation of 25 officers  from the Nigerian Army made the news in August 2023. The army spokesperson, Onyema Nwachukwu,  told journalists  their resignation was approved by the chief of army staff after they applied and met the terms for voluntary discharge. It is very unlikely that the resignation of 500 officers from one ethnic group would go unreported by the media. We found no evidence of this claim on any communication channels used by the  army ,  airforce  or  navy . Such a claim could lead to tension among Nigeria’s ethnic groups. But there is no evidence it was true, either in May 2023 or March 2024.",FALSE
9-Feb-24,"No, Nigeria's president, lawmakers did not confirm that Ibadan blast was a terrorist attack",": A video on Facebook claims that Nigeria’s president and members of the house of representatives have confirmed that the explosion in Ibadan, Oyo state was a terrorist attack.

The next day a video posted on Facebook  claimed  that Nigeria’s president Bola Tinubu and some members of the house of representatives had declared the explosion a terrorist attack.  In the video, the narrator referenced  two   articles , claiming that they confirmed his earlier suspicions about the “dreaded”  Boko Haram  invasion of Oyo state.  He says: “They came out en masse to debunk it on social media platforms. But yesterday, the reverse was the case … The presidency, or should I say the president himself, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has come today, 17 January 2024, to tell you that it was a terrorist attack.” The  video  was published to a public Facebook group with over 183,000 followers. It was also posted  here ,  here  and  here  and continues to circulate.  But was the explosion declared a terrorist attack? We checked. The  first report  quoted in the video was published in the  Nation newspaper  on 17 January. It highlighted the commitment of the Nigerian house of representatives to pass a law that would empower community policing groups to stop insecurity.  Stanley Olajide  was quoted as saying such a law was urgently needed, especially after events like the Ibadan explosion. He is the  chair  of the house committee on information communication technology. In the article, Olajide said the explosion was the result of the illegal storage of explosives by illegal miners in a residential area. The  second  referenced report was by the  Vanguard newspaper  and conveyed the president's concern about the explosion. Tinubu ordered the authorities to arrest the perpetrators and instructed the  National Emergency Management Agency  to collaborate with the Oyo state government to offer relief to the victims. The reports did not say the incident was a terrorist attack, although the president and the house of representatives acknowledged that it was the result of human error.   Africa Check also found no media reports suggesting that the incident had been classified as a terrorist attack.

But the claim is false and the list is fake.,"A message circulating  on WhatsApp  and  Facebook  in Nigeria in early 2024 claims that the  National Universities Commission  (NUC) has discovered about 100 fake professors in the country’s university system.  The message includes screenshots that  list  the supposed fake professors. It reads: “ Full list of 230 fake professors discovered in 23 top Nigerian Universities. In terms of tribe, Yoruba have the highest number. In terms of gender, The female gender have the highest number. While Bayero University Kano has the highest number with 20.” The claim can be found  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  Some of the social media posts  link to a report  published by  Channels TV,  a leading national TV station, under the  headline  “About 100 Fake Professors Uncovered In Nigerian Universities – NUC”. But what’s the full story here? The  Channels TV  article was published in December 2019. Other media organisations also reported on the story in 2019, as can be seen  here ,  here  and  here . The  reports say the claim  came from a statement credited to Prof Abubakar Rasheed, who was the commission’s executive secretary then. The statement was published in the commission’s bulletin, according to the reports.  We found the  bulletin dated 18 November 2019 . It  focused on a retreat  the commission held with vice-chancellors of Nigerian universities.  The  bulletin records that  Rasheed asked the vice-chancellors to report “fake” professors in the universities.  The  bulletin read : “The NUC Scribe disclosed that about 100 fake Professors’ details were posted on the website and the Commission had to send the names to the various universities for verification. He enjoined the Vice-Chancellors to delegate desk officers who would be responsible for checking the list of professors in their respective universities before uploading the same on the provided website. He stressed that the fight against fake professors was a collective responsibility.” The  reports however made  no mention of the commission releasing a list of names and didn’t circulate any such list.  Since  the claim went viral  in the first week of January 2024, most of the universities on the list have released official statements saying they have no “fake” professors and that the names listed on social media are not members of their staff. See some of the rebuttals  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  The commission’s acting executive secretary, Chris Maiyaki, also  debunked the claim  in an official statement:  The NUC wishes to deny these media reports categorically and unequivocally. They are fake, untrue and a figment of the imagination of the author(s), all happening at an unsuitable time, when the nation is awaiting the outcome of the investigation into the fake certificate saga from universities in some neighbouring countries. Specifically, the fake news items have been circulating in two forms – (i) as a link to a 2019 online news item; and (ii) as a separate list of names of the alleged fake Professors in various Nigerian Universities, which was not the case. We consider these unfounded publications as ill-conceived and a ploy by unscrupulous persons to create in plausible a tone, disquiet, panic and provoking outcries at both the national and international levels. The  statement  said the issue resulted from a 2019 project in which the commission compiled and published a list of full professors in the Nigerian universities system. Maiyaki  said the NUC found anomalies  during the exercise, such as associate professors being listed as full professors.  It then shared the collated data with the Nigerian universities “for the purpose of authentication by the competent authorities as to who qualifies to be a full professor.” He said the commission completed the verification in 2019.",FALSE

By clicking on the WhatsApp link attached to the post, Africa Check discovered that the platform is  run by different people , but using the same format. They sent us videos of users reviewing the investment platform as testimonials. They also sent us a list of payment packages showing how much to invest and the return – always double what you invest. Your money would also be in your account in “less than 45 minutes”, they said, with registration the only requirement. We selected a package and filled in the required details such as our name, bank details and occupation. We were told that our registration had been successfully processed. Using online bank transfer interfaces, we found that the accounts provided belonged to two people – Kelechi Salome and Omowunmi Samson. After a while, the two of them began to incessantly ask for money through multiple phone calls and a barrage of text messages.  This was a major red flag.

4-Dec-23,"No, video does not show Russian aircraft attacking Israel amid Israel-Hamas war","Misinformation has been on the rise since conflict between Israel and Hamas escalated into full-blown war in October 2023. We found no truth to the claim that Russia has attacked Israel, as claimed in a video posted on Facebook.","Note:  This report includes details about a breaking news story. Information was, as far as possible, correct at the time of publication but may change rapidly. “Russia attack Israel”  reads  the text overlaid on a video circulating on Facebook.  The video, posted on 21 October 2023, shows several aircraft flying over what appears to be a city.  Russia  has been  at war  with its eastern European  neighbour  Ukraine  since February 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. Israel  is a country in the Middle East.  Decades-old conflict  between Israel and Palestinian armed group  Hamas  escalated on 7 October 2023 when  Hamas launched an attack on Israel from  Gaza , a narrow territory that lies mainly within Israel and has been controlled by Hamas since 2007. The next day Israel responded with its own rocket strikes into Gaza and declared war on Hamas. Russian president Vladimir Putin has warned that the war could  spread beyond  the Middle East and  called for a ceasefire .  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has, however,  accused  Russia of being one of the countries financing Hamas’s attack on Israel. The  video  has been viewed by close to a million Facebook users, and attracted over 2,500 comments.  It appears to be a copy of a video posted on TikTok by a user under the handle  @fastupdate5 . While the video is no longer visible on the profile, its profile picture shows someone flying the Palestinian flag and its description says “support Palestine”.  The same video has also been posted  here  on TikTok with the same text saying “Russia attack Israel”. It was also  posted  as a different claim, with  text  reading “US support in Israel”.   Some of the social media users commenting on the clip are not convinced it shows a Russian attack on Israel, saying the clip is from a “video game” and it is “fake news”.  But has Russia attacked Israel? It is highly unlikely that Russia could be at war with Ukraine and Israel at the same time. And if Russia did enter the war between Israel and Hamas, and attack Israel, it would be a  major world geopolitical event that would be immediately and extensively covered in the global media. But there are no trustworthy sources reporting anything like it.  In November, a month into the Israel-Hamas war, Russia was  intensifying  its attack on Ukrainian power and heating infrastructure, with media reports suggesting Russia was taking advantage of the winter season. Russia only  spoke out against  the war in Gaza, but has not become involved in it.",FALSE

This video that claims to show Israel dropping a bomb on Palestinians in Gaza is also false; it’s from the Sudan conflict.,"Warning:  This report fact-checks a disturbing video. Discretion is advised. It also includes details about a breaking news story. Information was, as far as possible, correct at the time of publication but may change rapidly.  A  video  circulating on Facebook in November 2023 shows what appears to be a bomb being dropped on civilians gathered near large white tanks. The aerial footage  shows  the bomb falling from the sky until it detonates in the middle of the crowd. Black smoke billows shortly after, while some people can be seen fleeing. One of the captions accompanying the 30-second video clip  reads : “ Palestinians in Gaza rushed to the water tanks to draw the last of what was left in them, so they gathered around the water pipe to fill their bottles with whatever remaining water was available. Israel Defense Force (IDF) took advantage with a bomb dropped directly above them to kill them. Spread this clip so that people know about the barbarism and atrocity committed by Israel.” The  Israel Defense Force (IDF)  is the country’s military organisation. Its mission is to protect and defend Israel and its civilians, according to its  website .  The video has also been posted  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But what exactly does it show?  Israel , a small country in the  Middle East , and Palestine have been in  conflict  for decades.  The Palestinian armed group,  Hamas , launched an attack on Israel on 7 October. Rockets were fired and thousands of armed men crossed the Gaza border, killing a  reported 1,400 people  in Israel. Israel responded with its own rocket strikes into Gaza and  declared war  on Hamas on 8 October. Hamas controls the  Gaza Strip , a narrow territory that lies mainly within Israel. The strip is densely populated. Poverty is high. The people who live there are mainly Palestinian.  By 23 November, more than 14,500 people had reportedly been  killed  in Gaza, while  talks  of a ceasefire looked promising. The war has exacerbated the  water crisis  in the area, with the  United Nations  (UN)  –  a global organisation dedicated to peace and security  –  warning of an imminent outbreak of  waterborne diseases .  We found no media reports of Israel bombing Palestinians seeking water in Gaza. Such an incident would’ve been widely covered given the global interest in the war.  A reverse image search of the video’s keyframes led us to a longer clip  posted  on Facebook by the international news agency  Al Jazeera  on 12 October. A machine translation of its caption  reads , in part: “ ‎Sudanese army bombed a ‘tanker’ of fuel belonging to the Rapid Support Forces in Khartoum‎.” Khartoum‎ is the capital city of  Sudan , a country in north-eastern Africa. The  Rapid Support Forces  (RSF) is a paramilitary group, accused of carrying out “ ethnically motivated attacks ” in the country. Other fact-checking organisations also found the video was of a bombing at a fuel station in  Khartoum‎ , not Gaza ,  here ,  here  and  here .  On 15 April , fighting broke out between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), the country’s military government, and the RSF for control of the country.  Fighting has been concentrated in and around the Darfur area and Khartoum. The  UN refugee agency  said the conflict between the rival forces in Sudan was intensifying.  By 7 November , more than 4.5 million people had been internally displaced, more than a million had fled to neighbouring countries and many more had been killed. The video circulating on Facebook does not show a bombing in Gaza. It shows the Sudanese army attacking fuel tanks belonging to the Rapid Support Forces in Khartoum.  Spreading false information  about the war could intensify tensions and cause further panic, making it harder for those affected to get help.",FALSE

The  DSS is a state agency  that deals with internal security. The video, dated 11 October 2023, is captioned: “Nnamdi Kanu has finally been released.” Kanu is a political activist and leader of the  Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob) ,  a group seeking the restoration of the Republic of Biafra .  Biafra  is a region in south-eastern Nigeria. Its secession in 1967 triggered a civil war. When the war ended in 1970, the region was reintegrated into Nigeria. In September 2017, the Nigerian government  banned Ipob  and declared it a terrorist organisation after getting  a court nod .  Other posts about Kanu’s alleged release can be found  here ,  here  and  here . But are they true? We checked. Kanu was first  arrested in 2015  on several charges including publishing defamatory material, terrorism and possession of firearms. But he disappeared after being  granted bail , only to be  rearrested  in Kenya in 2021 and brought back to Nigeria. In October 2022, the Court of Appeal  ruled in Kanu’s favour , dismissing all charges against him  and ordering  his unconditional release. However, the state services department  ignored  the court  order  and appealed to the Supreme Court. It is  reported  that the apex court will deliver its verdict on the matter on 15 December 2023. We found no reports of Kanu's release from credible media houses. Such a significant development would have been widely reported. There is also no such announcement on the  ministry's website . Kanu’s lawyer,  Aloy Ejimakor ,  visited him  at the DSS facility in Abuja on 23 November. The claim that Kanu has been released is false.",FALSE
29-Nov-23,Network service provider MTN had a tech ‘glitch’ but isn’t clearing customers’ airtime debts,Several Facebook users in Nigeria have posted that MTN Nigeria has cleared airtime debts. But MTN has denied the claim and blamed a system error for the glitch.,"MTN has cleared the debts of its users, according to numerous  posts  on Facebook in Nigeria. MTN  is a network service provider and one of Africa's largest communications service providers. One post from 11 November 2023 reads, in part: “Good news for MTN users! If you owe MTN money for airtime or data that you borrowed, the company has decided to clear your debt.” It goes on to say users can check if their debt has been cleared by dialling *310#.  Customers can get airtime in “ advance ”, the cost of which is usually deducted from subsequent airtime subscriptions on the customer’s MTN line. This means that users can end up with a debt on their account, if they don’t buy enough airtime to cover any outstanding debt.

The Cable newspaper  reported  that MTN had called it a system glitch. On 11 November MTN  posted  on X (formerly Twitter) about the issue: “We had a system glitch!

By 27 November, the death toll in Gaza was  reported  to be over 15,000. At the time of writing, a  ceasefire  was in place with  hostages  and prisoners exchanged between the two sides. The claim that an Israeli  sniper  was shot and killed by Hamas was also  posted on X , formerly Twitter, by an account with  over 2.2 million followers.

We also noticed the  Israeli flag   –  blue and white with the Star of David  –  on the right arm of the man in the photo. This led us to believe that the man is an Israeli soldier.  However, a Google reverse image search  showed  that the  photo  has  been online  since at least 2020.  The news agency  Reuters  also debunked the claim: “The name ‘Barib Yariel’ does not appear on an Israel Defence Forces (IDF)  list of fallen  soldiers.”  A Google search of key phrases such as “Barib Yariel” and “Israeli sniper killed by Hamas” does not bring up any reports by trustworthy sources.

Properly stored water can last for a long time, although the taste might change.","A  post  on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, claims that the water we drink expires.  The 5 September 2023 post reads: “Breaking News: Are you aware the water we drink has an expiry date?”  The post features a  photo  of three different brands of water in sachets and bottles. But can this type of water product expire? We investigated.  The water we drink comes from different sources, whether  purified  or not. We get water from private wells or boreholes and public water systems.  However, it is important to note that  water can get contaminated , which then makes it unsafe to drink. When it isn’t stored properly, it can get contaminated  by fertilisers, pesticides or other chemicals . Foodsafety.gov , a US agency dedicated to providing  food safety  information , told  Verify  that “water will store indefinitely, though the taste may be impacted by storage conditions, including sunlight, items stored around it and the containers being used to store it”.  In the US, a   law in the state of New Jersey  required  bottled water to have an expiry date of two years from the day it was bottled. That  law was revoked  in 2004.  According to the New York state’s  Department of Health , many manufacturers still give their bottles  two-year expiration dates . But this is mainly in order to preserve the taste, and only applies to water bottles that have not been opened and have been properly stored. Water stored in containers at home should be replaced every  six months , according to the US’s public health agency, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The  International Bottle Water Association   recommends  that water should be stored at “room temperature or cooler, out of direct sunlight and away from solvents and chemicals such as petrol, paint thinners, household cleaners and dry cleaning chemicals”. Despite these recommendations, water has no expiration date and, when stored properly, it is safe for drinking and cooking for years.",FALSE

20-Sep-23,No evidence that prominent judge Haruna Tsammani asked Nigerians to forgive president Bola Tinubu for controversial drug case,Facebook users claim that judge Haruna Tsammani said president Bola Tinubu should be forgiven in connection with a decades-old drug case in the US. But there’s no evidence that the judge at the Presidential Election Petition Court made such a remark.,"Posts  circulating on Facebook claim that judge Haruna Tsammani has asked Nigerians to forgive president Bola Tinubu for his alleged drug crime. A 8 September 2023 post features the judge’s photo and a quote that  reads : “Since Jesus can forgive and forget why can’t you forgive Tinubu’s drug crime.” Tsammani is a judge at Nigeria’s Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC). He led the panel that heard the  petition  filed by opposition leaders, challenging Tinubu’s victory in the February 2023 presidential elections. On 6 September, the  court upheld the election  of Tinubu as president.  The drug case referred to is likely a  1993 matter  that saw Tinubu forfeit US$460,000 to the US government. It’s alleged he was involved in money laundering and drug trafficking, but he was  never convicted  on drug trafficking related charges in the US. The opposition leaders who challenged Tinubu’s February 2023 win brought up the drug case, saying Tinubu should not have contested the presidential election.  The same quote has been attributed to Tsammani  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here , and  here . But did Tsammani ask Nigerians to forgive Tinubu for his “drug crime”? We checked. Such a quote would show the judiciary was not impartial or independent.

There is also no comment like this in the  final ruling  of the presidential tribunal headed by Tsammani. The Facebook post does not mention when or where the judge might have made the comment.

We checked.  Some of the  posts  promoting the investment platform say you will be paid double of what you invest into the bank account you provide during registration.

But claims that a new policy will see a rate of just over one naira to the dollar – down from more than 700 naira – are false.,"Nigeria’s economy is struggling with inflation as a result of the  removal of a key fuel subsidy . This has  led to a sharp increase  in  transport and production costs , directly affecting the cost of goods and services across the country. In light of this, a  post  shared on Facebook and  WhatsApp  in Nigeria claims the  Central Bank of Nigeria  (CBN) is introducing a new policy that will allow the naira to be exchanged at N1.25 to $1.  The  post  reads: “Breaking Central Bank of Nigeria is about to introduce a new naira policy by November 2023 that would make $1 USD exchange = N1.25.”  The same claim appeared on Facebook  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  But did the banking regulator announce this new policy? We checked. Given the rising cost of living and the price at which the  naira exchanges  – N765 to the dollar in September 2023 – such a policy by the central bank would have made both local and international headlines, if it were true.

The 21 August 2023 post  reads, in part : “Check now if you are among the Lagosians to receive this Palliative from the Federal Government of Nigeria.” We found similar posts  here ,  here  and  here . In August 2023, the federal government  approved  a N5 billion palliative fund for each of the 36 states in Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory. Money will be given to the state governments as grants and loans to help them distribute food to the poor. This is to help cushion the effect of the hike in fuel prices and rising  inflation . But do these posts on social media link to a website where Nigerians can register to receive these funds directly from the federal government? We investigated. When we clicked on  the link  in the post, we reached a private website featuring a “palliative form” and a photo of the Lagos state governor,  Babajide Sanwo-Olu .  The form asks for personal information, such as your name, email address and local government area of residence. We found that whatever information we filled in, we were  congratulated  for qualifying to receive the funds and  asked to share  the form with five groups or 15 friends on WhatsApp. We were then asked to pick our “ method of receiving payment ” and  promised that we would receive  email confirmation within 24 hours. It appeared that the form had been shared 29,000 times and commented on 37,000 times. These were all signs that the posts were examples of  engagement bait , or an attempt to drive traffic to the website and gather the personal information of users, possibly in order to scam them or commit identity fraud. The reach of the form increases as more people share it, on either Facebook or WhatsApp.  But there is no such evidence that the federal government’s palliative funds are being paid out directly to anyone who registers on this site. This is misleading at best, harmful at worst.  On 3 September, the Lagos state governor  began to distribute various food items , expected to reach 500,000 vulnerable residents in Lagos.

It was registered in 1989, but is now inactive.  However, none of the posts mention “Access Capital Investment Limited” or allude to “Access Capital Investment Platform” being a company that existed in the late 1980s and has now resumed operations in Nigeria.  There is no proof that the inactive company is in any way linked to the investment platform named in the Facebook posts in question. Nigerians might mistake the investment platform as an affiliate of the popular  Access Bank .  But in 2022, Access Bank  distanced itself  from the platform and brought this to the attention of several agencies, including  the Nigeria Exchange, according to news site the Cable. The bank’s statement reads in part: “The management of Access Bank Plc and its subsidiaries wish to inform the public that our attention has been drawn to an online investment entity known and described as ‘Access Capital Investment Platform’ which has been soliciting members of the public to invest into its Access Capital Investment products promising mouth-watering returns on investment. “By this disclaimer, Access Bank Plc wishes to dissociate itself, aﬃliates, subsidiaries and/or proxies from the activities, contract, claims or business engagements of Access Capital Investment Platform.” Africa Check has previously investigated similar false investment schemes  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .

8-Aug-23,"No, Nigerian Red Cross Society didn’t conduct HIV tests that showed high number of cases in Abuja",The National Agency for the Control of Aids has clarified that no tests were conducted by the Red Cross and that the provided statistics were false.,"A  post  circulating on Facebook in Nigeria claims that the  Nigerian Red Cross Society  (NRCS) conducted HIV tests on 197 people in Abuja and 119 were positive.  “So last week, the Red Cross reportedly ran HIV tests for 197 people in Abuja, Nigeria. 119 of them were positive and 60% of the positive tests were male. If you can't control yourself, use condoms. Just stop playing games with your life,” the post reads.  Abuja  is the capital city of Nigeria. HIV, or the  human immunodeficiency virus , targets the immune system by destroying CD4 cells, a type of white blood cells that play an important role in fighting off disease. This makes the body more vulnerable to many other illnesses. The NRCS was established in 1960 by the government. It complements the work of public authorities in humanitarian interventions. The claim was posted on Facebook  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here , here  and  here . Tackling HIV across Africa has been a priority for most governments on the continent. Claims of an increase in cases could cause panic and fear.  But did the NRCS really conduct HIV tests in the capital city and find that about 60% of the results were positive? According to the  latest official data , Nigeria has a national HIV prevalence of 1.3% among people aged 15 to 64. In the Federal Capital Territory, where Abuja is located, the prevalence is 1.4%. This is lower than the prevalence rate suggested in the Facebook posts. Nigeria’s  National Agency for the Control of Aids  coordinates HIV/AIDS activities in the country. In July, it  said  on its official Twitter ( now known as X ) account that the NRCS did not conduct any HIV testing in Abuja and that the statistics were false. “After investigation and reaching out to The Nigerian Red Cross Society ( @nrcs_ng ), CSOs, CBOs, and other Implementing Partners IPs operating in Abuja, we confirm the statement is entirely FALSE,” the tweet reads.  “There was no outreach conducted in Abuja, and the claim that 119 people tested positive out of 197 is false.""",FALSE
27-Jul-23,Facebook account offering Nigerians a chance to double their money is a scam,A Facebook post is offering users a chance to double their money. But this is just another scam.,"A  post on Facebook  promises to “assist the less privileged and also reduce the rate of unemployment” in Nigeria, through a programme that will, apparently, “double money”.  The post, dated 24 May 2023, also  says : “DON'T NEED TO DEPEND ON YOUR PARENTS FOR SCHOOL FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES FOLLOW THE LINK BELOW.” A video is  attached  to the post, where a woman encourages users to join the platform, saying: “It is working, it is real.” She also claims it worked for her. Like many similar  schemes we have debunked , this post also includes a WhatsApp number for further engagement.  We also found similar posts  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But is this another scam? We checked. Africa Check has investigated  several posts  promising to double users’ investments.  One of the signs that  this post  is also a scam is the poor writing, with spelling errors and no punctuation. It is also written in capital letters – another red flag. The page identifies the investment platform as  Earn double money plc , but we found no such business registered with the  Corporate Affairs Commission . The commission is responsible for regulating the formation, registration and management of companies in Nigeria. The page also has no followers and is not verified by Meta.  It would be expected that a legitimate business would have at least some followers on its social media pages. All these signs   point to a pattern of  scams  Africa Check has uncovered before.  A platform that offers unrealistic returns and no risks for an investment may be a sign of a Ponzi  scheme , where existing investors are paid from new investments, therefore incentivising those involved to keep on recruiting new people.  In November 2022 , the  Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC)  flagged a number of schemes out to defraud Nigerians. The EFCC is responsible for fighting financial crimes in the country. The commission also urged users to be wary of similar schemes offering huge returns. With the  high cost  of living in Nigeria, people looking for ways to make money could fall prey to such scams.

27-Jul-23,"No, election tribunal hasn't declared Peter Obi winner of Nigeria’s 2023 February presidential election",Nigeria's election petition tribunal began hearing cases against the country's electoral commission in early May 2023. But claims that the tribunal has declared the candidate Peter Obi the winner of February's presidential election are false.,"Does a candidate need to secure 25% of the votes cast in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to be declared the winner of Nigeria's  presidential election ?  This has been the subject of much debate following the country’s 25 February 2023 polls. Nigeria  has  36 states and the federal capital territory. No other candidate received 25% of the vote in the FCT, except the Labour Party's  Peter Obi , who  received about 59% . The  Independent National Electoral Commission  (Inec) conducted the election and declared the ruling party’s Bola Tinubu the  winner . Obi has challenged this outcome. The tribunal  began hearing  his case on 8 May. Under  Nigerian law , in a multi-candidate presidential election, the winner must have the highest number of votes overall and at least one quarter of the votes in two-thirds of all states and the FCT.  But  an 18 July post  on Facebook claims that the court had declared Obi the winner of the election because he met the 25% threshold. The  video  accompanying the post appears to show the owner of the Facebook page attributing the claim to “Arise TV news”. The video has been viewed over a million times and shared over 10,000 times. Arise News  is a Nigerian-owned television station broadcast from the UK and the USA. The same claim was reposted on Facebook  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  But did the election tribunal declare Obi winner? Local media  reported that  on 4 July, Inec presented one of the three witnesses it had previously lined up and closed its defence against the allegations made by Obi. This is the latest report on the case at the time of publication. We found no other reports on the case in any credible media organisation – including none from Arise TV reporting that the elections tribunal had declared Obi the winner of the presidential election. Such an anticipated verdict in what is a very high-profile case would have made both local and international headlines, if it were true. It’s not.",FALSE

Another clue is that the MelBet Nigeria page has only four followers while the official account has over 300.  Sports betting companies are regulated by the  National Lottery Regulatory Commission  (NLRC) and MelBet is on the  list of approved sports betting  permit holders in Nigeria.  The NLRC has urged the public to be  wary  of websites created by fraudsters.

The post  in question is poorly written with random capitalisation and punctuation mistakes, which is uncharacteristic of a credible investment company.  The page also has no followers while  other pages  with similar content have few followers. Africa Check found  another Facebook post  with a video of popular Nollywood actor,  Charles Inojie , advertising Cash Chain investment.  A similar post  about  Bold Gains investment  used another Nollywood actor to promote the platform. Featuring celebrities in their posts is one of the methods scammers use to entice users on Facebook.  Africa Check found a post on a popular Nigerian online forum,  Nairaland , on Cash Chain being a scam.

In 2021, Ghana’s  Economic and Organised Crime office  (EOCO)  called on  the public to stop investing in Chymall, saying it was a ponzi scheme.

19-Apr-23,Beware of fake link asking Nigerians to register for post-petroleum subsidy aid,"A link is spreading on social media in Nigeria, claiming to be to the registration portal for government aid recently announced by the federal ministry of finance and budget planning. But it’s a scam, potentially trying to steal people’s personal information.","A link to a  website  asking Nigerians to register for a “post-petroleum subsidy palliative” is circulating on Whatsapp and Facebook in Nigeria. The webpage is headed “Fuel Subsidy Removal Palliative Portal”. It includes photos of Nigeria’s minister of finance  Zainab Ahmed , a queue at a fuel station and the logo of the federal ministry of finance, budget and national planning. An application form on the page asks for respondents’ personal details, including their contact details and local government area of residence. The link was shared on Facebook  here  and  here . A  message  was also shared with Africa Check on WhatsApp, asking Nigerians to confirm if they are eligible for the subsidy and a link. The Nigerian government  wants to remove a subsidy  on petrol by June 2023, saying the cost has become unsustainable. But  some Nigerians are concerned  that this could lead to inflation and more hardship.  On 5 April Ahmed  announced  that the Nigerian government had secured US$800 million from the World Bank to support the most vulnerable Nigerians during this period.  The money would be shared to 10 million households registered in a national social register as a  form of relief , or “palliative”, once the fuel subsidy ends. But is this website asking people to register legit? We checked. When you click on the “apply now” button on the site, you are taken to a  sports betting site , not a registration portal .  Another red flag is that the site asks users for their personal details. This could be an attempt at  phishing  – stealing people’s valuable personal information. Scammers can then use this information to take control of bank accounts and more. The federal ministry of finance on 11 April   said  the site was fake and warned people not to fall for the scam. “FAKE: It has come to our attention that a website purporting to be that of the Nigerian ministry of finance, is registering Nigerians on a fuel subsidy removal palliative. THIS IS A SCAM!” the ministry said on its   official Twitter account . “We strongly condemn these scammers & call on Nigerians to be extra careful/vigilant.""",FALSE
26-Apr-23,"No, Nigeria’s supreme court hasn’t ruled in favour of Peter Obi’s Labour Party as video claims",A video circulating on social media in Nigeria claims that the country's supreme court has ruled on a controversial petition to overturn Bola Tinubu's victory in the March 2023 presidential election. But this is not true - the petition has not yet reached the court.,"A video posted  on Facebook  claims that Nigeria’s supreme court has ruled in favour of the  Labour Party ’s presidential candidate, Peter Obi, who is challenging the outcome of the  25 February 2023 election . One of  the requests in Obi’s petition  to the presidential election tribunal is that Bola Tinubu should not be declared president-elect because he did not get 25% of votes in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja,  as required by the Nigerian constitution .  Tinubu ran on the ticket of the ruling  All Progressives Congress . “ 25% of FCT: Supreme Court of Nigeria has ruled in favour of Peter Obi. INEC to withdraw Tinubu – Benedict,”  the caption  to the video reads. It includes a video in which the claim was repeated. Inec refers to the  Independent Nigeria Electoral Commission , which organises elections in the country. The same video appears on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here , and a very similar version with the same claim  here  and  here .  Obi won the FCT, with  59% of the votes . Tinubu came second with 19% of the votes.  But has the supreme court ruled in Obi’s favour? In the one video, the commentator references a March 2023 TV interview with former justice minister and attorney-general of the federation  Michael Aondoakaa .  In that interview, Aondoakaa talked about the supreme court’s 2008 interpretation of the controversial  section 133 of the Nigerian Constitution .  This section  says :  “A candidate for an election to the office of President shall be deemed to have been duly elected to such office where, being the only candidate nominated for the election - (a) he has a majority of YES votes over NO votes cast at the election; and (b) he has not less than one-quarter of the votes cast at the election in each of at least two-thirds of all the States in the Federation and the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.” The  controversy  in 2023 was whether a presidential candidate would have to win at least 25% of the vote in Abuja, in addition to the same share of the vote in at least two-thirds of all states. Aondoakaa  said the supreme court’s interpretation  in 2008 suggests getting 25% of the votes in Abuja is compulsory. But he also said that it was 14 years ago and the court might want to review that interpretation.  At time of publication, Obi’s petition is  still with the presidential election tribunal . It has not reached the supreme court and so the court could not have ruled on it. The claim in the viral video is incorrect.",FALSE

24-Mar-23,Nigeria's electoral body denies claims that former Lagos commissioner was head of tech,Allegations continue to swirl around the manner in which Nigeria's presidential election on 25 February 2023 was conducted. The latest claim is that the ruling party had a helper embedded in the electoral body – but Inec has denied this.,"Nigeria's 2023 presidential election remains  mired in controversy . The country's electoral body failed to  effectively implement  the  Bimodal Voter Accreditation System  (BVAS) and the  electronic transmission  of results. The  Independent National Electoral Commission  or Inec is responsible for conducting elections in Nigeria. Inec declared Bola Tinubu of the governing  All Progressives Congress  the winner of the race for president, but his rivals have  gone to court  over this.  As the fallout continued, prominent politician Bode George  claimed in a television interview  that Femi Odubiyi, who he said was Inec's head of information technology, was behind the shutdown of BVAS servers during the election. George  said  Odubiyi was a former commissioner for science and technology in Tinubu’s administration.

And on 14 March 2023 Inec  denied claims  that it had appointed the former commissioner as its head of information and communication technology, or ICT.  In a  statement  shared  on its verified Twitter handle , Inec said: “To set the record straight, the name ‘Femi Odubiyi’ does not even exist within our ICT Department at the INEC headquarters in Abuja or any State office of the Commission.” Inec said none of its staff had ever held any political position in the country and urged the public to disregard the claim.",FALSE

Prof Saheed Aderinto  is a Nigerian-American professor of history and African and African diaspora studies at  Florida International University  in the United States. He was  announced  the 2023 winner of the  Dan David prize , alongside eight other history scholars, on 28 February. The  prize of US$300,000  is awarded annually to nine outstanding contributors to the study of history. The first  screenshot  posted appears to show a tweet from Nigerian president-elect Bola Tinubu congratulating Aderinto on his achievement, and Aderinto’s reply. It reads: “Thanks anyway for the recognition, I hope you restore Our stolen mandate.” The second screenshot shows a  congratulatory tweet  by Peter Obi, leader of the Labour Party, to which Aderinto appears to respond “thank you My President elect”. Tinubu  was  declared winner  of Nigeria’s 2023 presidential election by the  Independent Electoral Commission  on 1 March. His win is being  challenged in court  by  Obi  and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party. These different responses are posted side by side by Facebook users, apparently to show that Aderinto took a swipe at Tinubu and doesn’t support him. The screenshots appear on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here . But did Aderinto snub Tinubu while calling Obi “my president elect?” We checked.  The screenshots show the replies, supposedly from Aderinto, originating from an account with the handle @Aderinto0 and the professor’s photo as profile picture. But this account  doesn’t exist .  And on 13 March Aderinto  took to Facebook  to say: “I don't have a Twitter account.”  The professor said he “didn't make those statements”. According to a  fact-checking report  by CDD Fact Check published on 17 March, the account that responded to Tinubu was “a parody account” that changed its username from @Aderinto0 to @ellup81 after the tweets in the screenshot were posted.  Some  responses  to the tweets in the screenshots link back to @ellup81’s account.

In reply to the claim on social media, one user  wrote : “Please be calming down with them lies.” Another simply  asked : “Source??” But did a Nigerian named Chimaka become the first black woman to perform a heart transplant, in under 30 minutes, thanks to Peter Obi? And do the photos reflect this? We checked.  An internet search revealed that the photo of surgeons standing around an operating table is from a 2022 world-first  surgery .

1-Feb-23,No evidence daughter of Nigerian presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar said her father would ‘deal with’ disgruntled Rivers state governor,"Threatening remarks have been attributed to Hauwa Atiku-Uwais, daughter of Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the opposition People’s Democratic Party and a former vice president. But they are false, an aide told Africa Check.","A  post  shared on Facebook in Nigeria attributes a threatening quote to  Hauwa Atiku-Uwais , the daughter of  Atiku Abubakar .  Abubakar is one of the frontrunners in Nigeria’s 25 February presidential election and  the candidate  for the opposition  People’s Democratic Party  (PDP). He was vice president from 1999 to 2007. The  post  includes a portrait of Atiku-Uwais and the quote: “My dad has been a VP, and he knows the capacity and powers of the president. He will wipe [sic] Wike into shape, because let's not forget at the end of it all my dad is a Fulani man, a very wicked Fulani man, when he decides to deal with you he'd deal with you.”  Atiku-Uwais  is an entrepreneur and philanthropist.  Nyesom Wike  is  the vocal and influential governor of the southern  Rivers  state.  He lost  to Abubakar  during the PDP primary election in May 2022 and is part of a  group  of governors  who have been unhappy  with that result. Wike has boycotted most of the party’s campaign and said he  will announce  his preferred candidate early in 2023.  The five governors have demanded that the national party chairperson  Iyorchia Ayu  steps down as he is from the same region as Abubakar. But did Atiku-Uwais really say that her father would “deal with” Wike and whip him into shape? We searched  Atiku-Uwais’s Twitter account  and found no evidence of this statement. There have also been no reports in the local media of her saying anything related to Wike.  This is because the former vice president’s daughter has never made such a statement, Abubakar’s media adviser  Paul Ibe  told Africa Check. ""Hauwa Atiku-Uwais never said what was attributed to her,” Ibe said. “Like her father, Mrs Atiku-Uwais is an apostle of non-violence who will never speak nor manifest violence.” There is no evidence that Atiku-Uwais made any statement about how her father Atiku Abubakar would respond to Rivers state governor Nyesom Wike.",FALSE
25-Feb-23,No evidence letter is Nigerian presidential hopeful Abubakar’s proposed list of cabinet members,"Have elders in northern Nigeria, a political stronghold of opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, already drawn up a list of cabinet members in exchange for their support? No, a letter claiming this is false.","A letter  circulating online  lists names of proposed cabinet members for  Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) presidential candidate  Atiku Abubakar  if he wins the election. Abubakar is one of the frontrunners in Nigeria's presidential election on 25 February. He was vice president from 1999 to 2007. The PDP is the  main opposition party . The letter is claimed to be from the office of the former  Nigerian national  security adviser and PDP member   general Aliyu Mohammed Gusau , on behalf of the party’s “northern core-caucus elders forum”. It  reads : Greetings and well wishes to Your Excellency from the elders and forum of the People Democratic Party northern core-caucus.on behalf of the underlisted individuals, hereby forward the proposed list of appointments to the cabinet of incoming President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as per our verbal discussion at the closing rally of our great party, the PDP.

Abubakar will be  banking on the north  to swell his vote basket, making the letter credible. But did Gusau write a letter to Abubakar with this list of proposed cabinet members? Abubakar’s media aide ,  Paul Ibe ,  told Africa Check that the letter was a “poor job” and “propaganda”. Ibe said: “General Gusau is too experienced to do such a thing. Of course Atiku Abubakar would have those who he will want to be in his cabinet but not to the extent that General Gusau will be the one to put pen to paper to write a list.” He added: ""There is no truth in it.” We found no evidence that Gusau wrote a letter to Abubakar with a list of proposed cabinet members.

25-Feb-23,"No, former president Obasanjo did not stop a million Chadians from voting for Nigeria’s governing party",": As Nigerians vote in presidential elections, a widely shared claim is that hundreds of thousands of Chadians were set to vote for the APC, before a former president helped turn them away. This is false.","A  message  circulating on Facebook claims that former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo intercepted and helped turn back dozens of trucks carrying a million Chadians with permanent voter cards. It says the Chadians intended to vote for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) party. Nigerians were on Saturday 25 February 2023 voting for a new president and federal lawmakers.  The APC has been in office since 2015, and is hoping to retain power with president Muhammadu Buhari set to step down after the elections. Part of the message reads:  Obasanjo received a call from a junior immigration officer ( name withheld ) that unknown 100 trucks carrying over 1million Chadians got access to the Nigeria border and were heading to Kaduna. Obasanjo responded immediately around 2pm in the afternoon , Obasanjo called immigration boss but no response from him , Obasanjo asked his personal security officials to blocked all the roads leading to Kaduna and finally , the trucks were captured. The claim is attributed to “veteran activist, Charly Boy”.  It appears on  the Instagram handle of Charles Oputa , a Nigerian entertainer with 194,000 followers. Oputa goes by the stage name of Charly Boy.    Actor Tessy Oragwa also  posted it on  her  verified Facebook page , which has 1.5 million followers. But did any of this happen? Some of the claims in the message defy belief. It swings from “over 1.5 million Chadian citizens” and just “1.5 million” to “over 1 million” Chadian citizens and “nearly” 1 million Chadians. The number of trucks is constant – 100. Taken at face value, this would mean that 10,000 to 15,000 Chadians were crammed into a single truck. This is implausible.   The number of foreigners involved, the alleged involvement of a high-profile figure like Obasanjo, and what it would mean for the credibility of the election if true, means that such a story would have been widely reported in the media. We found no such coverage. A Google reverse  image search  of one of  the photos accompanying the message  reveals that it is from a  2021 incident  between the police and Fulani herders in  Kwara state  in Nigeria’s north-central region.  Another photo used as evidence for the claim is from a  2021 arrest  of armed men by Amotekun, a local security group in  Oyo state , southwestern Nigeria. Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo’s spokesperson, told Africa Check that his principal was not involved in such an incident. The use of such out-of-context photos is an expected disinformation tactic on election day. For more on what type of disinformation to expect,  read our blog .",FALSE

We checked. A closer look at the laptop screen in the photo shows that the website is headed “Civichive” and looks quite different to the Inec election results  website . A Google search reveals that  Civic Hive  is a non-governmental organisation that has a   dashboard  monitoring the results of Nigeria’s 2023 general election. The  Civic Hive  presidential election dashboard  appears to be the one in the photo circulating on social media. There is nothing suspicious about Fashola having visited or viewed this site.",FALSE

But this is false.","A  post  circulating on Facebook in Nigeria claims that  Lagos state  governor  Babajide Sanwo-Olu  has promised to release  secessionist leader  Nnamdi Kanu  “to the Igbos if he is re-elected”. The post, with a  photo  of Sanwo-Olu in Igbo dress, reads: “Lagos state governor promises to release IPOB's Nnamdi kanu to the Igbos if he's elected in the second term.” The  Igbo people  predominantly live in  southeastern  Nigeria. Kanu is  from  Abia , a state in southeast Nigeria. T he  Indigenous People of Biafra  (Ipob), and its military wing, the Eastern Security Network,  seeks to restore the  Republic of Biafra , established with the secession of Nigeria’s eastern region in 1967. After a brutal  30-month civil war  that ended in January 1970, the region was reabsorbed into Nigeria.  In  September 2017 , the Nigerian government banned Ipob and  labelled it  a terrorist organisation.  Kanu has been jailed by the Nigerian government on a series of charges,  including terrorism . He is still in custody  despite being acquitted  by a court ruling in October 2022.   Sanwo-Olu  is seeking re-election as the governor of Lagos state in the  18 March 2023 election .  In presidential elections on 25 February,  Bola Tinubu , a former governor of Lagos state and the country’s president elect for the  All Progressives Congress  (APC) , narrowly lost Lagos state to  Peter Obi  of the  Labour Party  (LP). This is despite Tinubu traditionally enjoying a stronghold in Lagos.  There are therefore speculations that Sanwo-Olu, who is seeking re-election under the APC, may lose the state to LP candidate  Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour . It is widely believed that Igbo people in Lagos  largely voted for Obi  in the presidential election. The  Facebook post  implies that the governor is trying to win over Igbos voters by promising to release Kanu if he wins the election. The same claim also appeared  here  and  here  on Facebook. But did Sanwo-Olu make this controversial promise? We found no evidence of any statement like this searching through Sanwo-Olu’s  official Twitter account . There have also been no reports of such a statement in the Nigerian media, which would be expected if it were accurate. “No, there’s nothing like that,” the governor’s spokesperson  Gboyega Akosile  told Africa Check. “The photo was taken over four years ago.” There is no evidence that Sanwo-Olu has promised to release Kanu if he is re-elected governor of Lagos state.",FALSE

Shisha  is a tobacco product, heated and smoked through a  hookah  or water pipe.  The graphic is posted with the claim that the woman smoking is Oyefusi. Oyefusi is the running mate of  Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour  in the  18 March 2023  election for governor in Lagos state. Rhodes-Vivour is a strong contender in the election. The LP presidential candidate,  Peter Obi ,  won the  most votes in the state  in the 25 February presidential election. The same claim has also been posted on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here . But is the woman in the photo Oyefusi?  The photo was shared on  Twitter  on 13 March with the same claim – that it showed the “ Deputy Governorship Candidate of a certain Political Party in Lagos State”.  Oyefusi  tweeted in reaction : “ This is not me, so I will never stoop low to your gutters or dignify you with a reply.”  A reverse image search did not reveal the origin of the photo, but we found no reports from credible sources linking it to Oyefusi. The woman in the photo does not particularly look like her.  This is another misleading post which could potentially influence voters ahead of the governorship and state house of assembly elections in Nigeria on 18 March.",FALSE

But claims on social media that the UK parliament confirmed that the vote was tampered with are false.,"A  video  shared on Facebook in Nigeria claims that members of  parliament  in the United Kingdom have confirmed that the 2023 presidential election was rigged. The video,  reposted  from Tiktok, is captioned: “game over for the APC as UK palliament [sic] confirms election was rigged.” The APC refers to the  All Progressives Congress , the ruling party to which president-elect Bola Tinubu and his predecessor Muhammadu Buhari belong.  Tinubu  was declared  the winner of the  February 2023 presidential election  on 1 March. This result  has been challenged  in court by the opposition. Dino Melaye, a former senator and spokesman of the presidential campaign of the  Peoples Democratic Party , the largest opposition party in Nigeria, also shared the post on  his Facebook page  to his 1.9 million followers. “APC rigged the election,” Melaye captioned  the video  on 17 March. The video has been re-posted more than 2,500 times since Melaye posted it, including  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But did members of the British parliament really say Nigeria’s election was rigged? In the  video , a member of parliament who says she counts herself as a member of the “Nigerian diaspora”, says that a group in her “constituency” has raised “concerns of serious failures of technology, security and communications in last month’s presidential elections, as has the European Union”. She asks “the minister” “what went wrong” in the Nigerian election, despite the support the UK government gave Nigerian civil society and the country’s Independent National Election Commission. The minister  replies  that the MP is correct that his government gave GBP5 million to Nigerian civil society. The video ends after he says that they “commend all those involved”, particularly for “resolving disputes through the courts and through peaceful means”.  But there is no mention in the video that the Nigeria election was “rigged”. At the end of the video clip, a logo is shown for “Chi Onwura”.  Onwura  is an  MP  and a member of the UK’s opposition, the  Labour Party .  The minister replying to Onwura is the Conservative Party MP  Andrew Mitchell .  We found the  transcript  of the 14 March parliamentary session in the video clip, published on the  website of the UK parliament . It also  shows  that no one in the UK parliament said the Nigerian election was rigged.  The claim that the UK parliament “confirmed” Nigeria’s election was rigged is false.",FALSE

The  posts  include a photo of a young white man in a suit and read, in part: “The Russian hacker claims he have many Nigerian friends who hoped so much on this election and seeing what INEC is doing promotes him to take action.”  Inec is responsible for conducting elections in Nigeria. Some of the  posts  include a  link  to an article published on a  suspicious-looking website , which includes the same photo as well as one of Obi and a graph showing the leaked “results”.  Apparently the hacker has revealed that Peter Obi’s  Labour Party  had 55 million votes, while the  Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) had 25 million and the ruling  All Progressives Congress  (APC) 15 million. Bola Tinubu  of the APC was  declared the winner  of the election on 1 March. Tinubu  polled  a total of  8,794,726 votes  to defeat PDP candidate  Atiku Abubakar  who had  6,984,520  votes and Obi who had  6,101,533 , according to results released by Inec.  Abubakar and Obi are  challenging Tinubu’s victory  in court. But this viral claim implies Obi actually won the election and Atiku came second, with Tinubu third.

9-Jun-23,"Is Nokia running a ‘hot’ phone giveaway to Facebook users in Nigeria and South Africa? No, ignore fake account",A Facebook page that claims to be running a phone giveaway by Nokia is a scam and not affiliated to the Nokia brand. The page uses a tactic called engagement bait to persuade people to engage with its posts to boost its visibility.,"A Facebook page called  N0kia Fellow Ph0ne Dashing Time  shared  a post  in May 2023 that has since garnered over 1,800 comments and over 4,200 shares.  Circulating in Nigeria and South Africa, the post claims that Nokia is giving away thousands of the latest cell phones.  It starts by  saying : “N0KIA HOT GIVEAWAY Make sure you apply for this Nokia giveaway Nokia is here to bless thousand of people with Latest phones and more Guess what?, you could win more than 3 pieces of this phones.” It then tells users to type out the letters of the word ""Nokia"" in separate messages in the comment section, without being interrupted by another “competitor”.  Facebook users are also asked to send a direct message to  the page  once this has been done. Nokia  is a telecommunications company that makes electronic products, including  cell phones .  Although the  profile picture used  by the "" N0kia Fellow Ph0ne Dashing Time "" page is of a Nokia cell phone, is the page associated with the multinational brand?  We checked.  Nokia’s official website  includes a link to its  Facebook page , which is called  Nokia . The page has about 12 million followers. When you visit the  Nokia  Facebook page’s About section, the Page Transparency information shows that it was created on 30 October 2008. By comparison, the  N0kia Fellow Ph0ne Dashing Time  page was created on 28 May 2023. It had only 405 followers at time of publication.   With  posts  promising that Nokia is  giving away  thousands of its latest phones, you would expect a competition announcement to appear on Nokia’s  official   social   media platforms . But there are no announcements about any  giveaway  there. This makes it unlikely that this giveaway is legitimate.  The competition entry described  in the post  shows evidence of it being engagement bait. According to Meta , the company which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, engagement bait involves making people like, share and comment on your post in order to   increase the post or page’s reach . These tactics are  spammy  and  inauthentic . Signs of this  in the post  are the request for users to type out the letters of the word ""Nokia"" in separate messages and to repeat the exercise if they are ""interrupted by another competitor"". A request to message the page is another  sign of engagement bait. Africa Check  has written about Facebook scams  many times in the past, and the  N0kia Fellow Ph0ne Dashing Time  giveaway post shows tell-tale signs of a scam.  One of the most obvious is that  the post  contains several grammatical errors, in phrases such as ""Nokia is here to bless thousand of people with Latest phones"" and ""3 pieces of this phones"". This should immediately raise suspicion about the page’s authenticity and association with Nokia.  Although the page’s name associates it with Nokia, another  post , from 6 June 2023, is unrelated to Nokia phones. It is a repost from another page and promises followers money, food, and job opportunities if they send a message  to the page , which was created only a day earlier.  This is clearly another scam.

He was the director of operations and he  stepped in when Ibrahim Magu was suspended as EFCC chair. Abba  left the EFCC and returned to the Nigerian police  after he was replaced by Bawa, who was appointed chairperson of the commission in February 2021. “CP Abba was seconded to the Commission in January 2016 to head the Counterterrorism and General Investigations, CTGI, Section at the Headquarters in Abuja. He was appointed the Director of Operations of the Commission in 2017, a position he held till 2020 when he took over from Ibrahim Magu as acting Chairman, a position he held till he returned to the Police,”  Abba’s profile on EFCC website reads .   The photo in circulation is  Abba’s official photo  from when he served as the acting chairperson of the EFCC for about seven months before Bawa’s appointment.

23-Jun-23,"No, this herbal recipe won’t ‘cleanse’ the uterus – consult doctors instead",A Facebook post claims its recommended recipe will “cleanse” the uterus. But experts say there is no evidence of this.,"“This recipe helps cleanse your uterus as well as your accumulated bad blocked tubes responsible for some infertility,” reads a  post on Facebook . The post, dated 7 June 2023, lists the  ingredients  for this recipe: lemon, negro pepper, aidan, ginger and clove. It then instructs readers on how to prepare the mixture and when to take it. “Clean and cut the needed ingredients, boil all ingredients together for 40 mins and allow to cool before drinking. Remember don't add excess water. Add water according to the size of material. Drink a small glass morning and evening for a week,” it says. According to the post, the mixture is “forbidden to women with ulcer” but men can take it if turmeric is added. The post  has been reposted  several times with a few comments thanking the author. We found the same claim  here . But is it true that this recipe can “clean” the womb and treat infertility? We took a closer look. The uterus, also called  the womb , is an important organ in a woman’s body. It is where  foetuses, or unborn babies, grow . Abnormalities in the uterus  can affect fertility . Occasionally, dilation and curettage (D&C) is used to remove tissue from inside the uterus, or “clean” it, according to the US non-profit organisation  Mayo Clinic . In some cases, D&C is combined with a process called a hysteroscopy, where the doctor inserts a slim instrument with light and camera into the uterus. These procedures may be done to remove tissue, tumours, placenta remaining after pregnancy, and cervical polyps. “These claims are not supported by scientific evidence. There is currently no such thing as ‘washing’ the uterus,” Oladapo Olayemi, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the  University of Ibadan , told Africa Check. The professor said there was no research to support the claims made about this recipe.  “There is no scientific rationale to even develop a hypothesis to test in research. These substances are used for food and no observation from eating them has suggested that they act on the uterus, not even in animals,” he said. He advised those who were worried about infertility to seek medical advice from qualified health practitioners.",FALSE

27-Jun-23,"No, this photo doesn’t show pre-colonial Igbo architecture in southeast Nigeria",The claim that this is a photo of “pre-colonial” Igbo architecture in Nigeria is false. It actually shows the palace of Foumban in Cameroon in 1907.,"A black-and-white  photo of a building  with carved wooden pillars and thatched roof has been  shared on Facebook , with the claim it shows the pre-colonial architecture of the Igbo people in southeast Nigeria.  “This is Pre Colonial, Igbo Architecture in South East Nigeria,” reads a caption  on the photo .  It  has been posted  with the claim that Africans, including Igbo people, had well-built houses before the colonial era.   The photo was posted  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here , and  here  with the same claim.  The  Igbo  is an ethnic group that lives predominantly in Nigeria’s southeastern geopolitical zone, a bulk of the region that  seceded from Nigeria  as the  Republic of Biafra  in the late 1960s. Pre-colonial Igbo communities  are known to have built houses with mud , thatched roofs and  carved wooden doors . Was the palatial house in the photo built in one of those communities in the region now known as southeast Nigeria, before  European colonisation ? None of the posts give any details about the building or its location in southeast Nigeria.  The first sign  the photo  was not taken in a pre-colonial Igbo community is that a man in the photo is wearing a white turban, the type typically worn by Muslim royals. Islam was  not known  in pre-colonial Igbo communities and  remains rare , and  Igbo traditional attire  did not include such turbans.  A reverse image search indicated it’s a  photo of the palace of  Foumban  in the Bamum kingdom in what is now northwestern  Cameroon . It was taken in 1907.  The man in the photo is believed to be  sultan Ibrahim Njoya , who was the  king of the Bamum people between 1895 and 1923 . Njoya is wearing a turban in many of the  photos  of him we found online.    We found a few other  publications  and  social media posts  linking the building in the photo with the kingdom of Bamum and Njoya, including  here ,  here  and  here .  The palace is also featured in a  Deutsche Welle  animated documentary about the king, titled  Njoya Ibrahim: Cameroon's Inventive King.

4-Jul-23,"Nigerians, beware of scam messages advertising birth registration jobs","The birth registration effort by NPC, Unicef and NYSC has opened the recruitment process for officials. There have been messages on WhatsApp and Facebook falsely asking Nigerians to apply.","Nigeria’s  National Population Commission  (NPC) is looking for people older than 18 to take part in its birth registration activity. That’s according to several  forwarded messages  sent to Africa Check on WhatsApp in June 2023. The population commission  is responsible for counting the country’s population through periodical censuses and surveys. The birth registration is an effort to ascertain the number of live births in Nigeria. “NPC E-BIRTH Registration Of Adhoc Staff Recruitment 2023 online application exercise is out all bonafide  citizens only who needs to work as Adhoc staff for the 2023 Population and Housing Census,” the message reads. It also includes  a link  for applications, which takes readers to a website. We found the same message on Facebook  here  and  here . But is this the correct link for the commission’s birth registration recruitment for adhoc staff? We checked. There are a few red flags that indicate the advert is a scam.  The provided  link  doesn’t lead to the official  website of the NPC . It directs to a simple website with a banner and an application form that asks for users’ personal information like gender, first name, last name, email, phone number and National Identification Number (NIN).  The  National Identity Management Commission  is the body in charge of identity management in Nigeria. It has regularly  advised Nigerians  not to expose their NIN to the public. Birth registration is a  collaborative effort  of the population commission,  National Youth Service Corps  (NYSC) and the  United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund  (Unicef), to promote birth registration in Nigeria.  The original link by the population commission to apply for the ad-hoc birth registration vacancies can be seen  here . The registration launched in June 2023 and interested persons can apply if they meet the requirements. You can either register as a corps member or an ad-hoc staff. The Guardian newspaper  reported  that in 2022, the population commission distanced itself from an online ad-hoc staff recruitment portal said to be for the 2023 census.

5-Jul-23,"No, lime water does not cure cancer – seek medical treatment instead",A Facebook post circulating in Nigeria claims that lime water can cure cancer. Experts say this is not true.,"A  video  circulating on Facebook in Nigeria claims drinking a mix of lime and water can cure any form of cancer. The person in the video, dated 28 May 2023, instructs viewers in a mixture of Igbo and English languages to put peeled lime in a glass of warm water. He says the concoction should be taken twice a day, in the morning and at night, for three months. Cancer is a  disease  that causes an abnormal growth of the body's cells that spreads to other parts of the body. The video  has been viewed  over 57,000 times while the same claim has been made elsewhere on Facebook  here ,  here  and  here . But is there any evidence that lime water can cure cancer? We checked. Lime  is high in vitamin C, antioxidants and other nutrients. As a result, they may help boost immunity and reduce the chance of heart disease, says  Healthline , a US-based website that shares medical content. It adds that lime juice is alkaline with a pH level of 8 or above.  Potential of hydrogen,  also known as pH , is used to express the level of alkalinity or acidity in something. Everything falls somewhere on a scale from one (lots of hydrogen and very acidic), to 14 (very little hydrogen and alkaline or “basic”).  Different parts  of the body maintain different levels of pH in order to function well.  Africa Check has  previously looked into claims  that you can cure cancer by making the body less acidic or more alkaline. But these claims misinterpret fundamental biological processes, including the regulation of the acid-base balance that is crucial for good health. As  Healthline  points out, there is no scientific evidence to support the claim that alkaline water can treat, prevent or cure cancer. ""Drinking lime water cannot cure cancer,”  Abidemi Adenipekun , a professor of radiation oncology at the  University of Ibadan , told Africa Check. He said the post appeared to be based on the knowledge that making a cell’s environment more alkaline could make it toxic to cancer.  Some  research  has shown that high acid levels in a tumour can make it grow more aggressively, so making these cells more alkaline might play a role in future therapies. But it’s important to note that these are changes in the  microenvironment  around a tumour, rather than changes across the body. These kinds of studies were not based on creating an alkaline environment in the human body. And changing the body’s pH could be dangerous. It is carefully  regulated  by a number of processes in the body, to keep functioning properly. ""Lime should be used as a supplement, and not be taken continuously. Those with cancer should also go for proper treatment,"" Adenipekun told Africa Check.",FALSE

OctaFX is a  business platform  that   helps Forex traders make trading decisions.  Forex refers to  foreign exchange , a global marketing place for exchanging money from one currency to another. People buy currencies when they are cheaper and sell them at higher prices to make profits. Those who are in this business are  called  Forex traders. This is the  official website  of OctaFX, with links to its  Facebook  and  Twitter  pages. The platform has over 500,000 followers on Facebook and is verified on Twitter. In May 2023, news site  the Punch   reported  that OctaFX had seen a rise in fraudulent activity in the platform's name. It has urged its clients to be wary of scammers unlawfully using the OctaFX brand to scam them.

We found a similar initiative called the  Nigeria Youth Investment Fund  (NYIF) by Nigeria’s federal government. It describes itself as dedicated to supporting the creative ideas, skills and talents of young people to help them become entrepreneurs. Using a fake name is common practice when the aim is to scam people. We looked more closely at the link in the post. We followed the  link  and landed on a  Google form  asking for personal information.  Google form  is a free survey administration software powered by search engine Google. The form asked for details such as full name, date of birth, phone number, and home and email addresses. This is sensitive information that could put users in danger of cyber or physical attacks.  One of the other red flags is that the page has just over 45 followers on  Facebook . This would be significantly higher if it were indeed a government initiative. For example,  N-Power , a Nigerian government initiative aimed at tackling unemployment among young people, has over 650,000  followers  on Facebook.

According to the 10 July 2023 post, Obi said: “I will be president of Nigeria in 2027.” The claim has also been posted on other Facebook pages such as  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . Obi, a former governor of Nigeria's south-eastern state of Anambra, was the  Labour Party 's presidential candidate in the 25 February 2023 vote. Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress  won the election , with Obi coming in third. While Tinubu has since been sworn in, Obi and another opposition party have  challenged  the result at an election tribunal. A statement deferring his presidential ambition until 2027 would suggest that Obi has lost faith in  the case he's making  to the tribunal. The posts do not include details of where or when Obi is meant to have made the comments. We also could not find any reporting of it in the mainstream media. And in  a statement  posted on his  verified Twitter account , Obi described the comments attributed to him as “bogus”. “I have noticed with dismay, an emerging pattern where fake media reports and news items are predicated on interviews and press remarks I never granted,” he said.   “Regrettably, our politics have sunken to this abysmal level where manipulation of the media space is now a trade. “For me, I shall continue to speak on topical national issues via recognized news and media outfits. But I certainly will not concern myself with cheap distractive trolls.""",FALSE
31-Jul-23,"Nigerians, beware of Facebook account impersonating popular church and trying to recruit you to join its fake investment platform",Africa Check has investigated several investment scams.

The page uses the name and logo of Nigeria’s  Living Faith Church Worldwide , popularly known as Winners Chapel.  Users, especially Christians, could fall prey and lose their money in the hope of making more. But is this another investment scam? We checked. Africa Check has investigated  several claims  of investments offering double profits. We have found that scam accounts often have poorly written posts.  This post is no exception: it is full of asterisks, random capitalisation and confusing claims. The  page  in question has only 16 followers and was created on 18 September 2022. Africa Check found the church’s official  Facebook  page, with over 2.8 million followers.

4-Aug-23,"No, Tetfund is not giving N30,000 grants to Nigerians. Ignore scam Facebook post","The Tertiary Education Trust Fund is not giving out grants of N30,000 to Nigerians. This Facebook post is a scam.","A  post  on Facebook claims that the  Tertiary Education Trust Fund  (Tetfund) is giving out grants to Nigerians. The post, dated 12 June 2023,  reads : “Apply today and become a beneficiary of TetFund Grant. This is available only for Nigerians.” The post includes a  link  to a website which says that Tetfund is giving out N30,000 to each beneficiary. The Nigerian government  established  Tetfund in 2011 to distribute, manage, and oversee education tax to state-owned tertiary institutions. But is Tetfund giving out grants directly to Nigerians? We checked. Tetfund is an intervention organisation that was established to offer  supplemental assistance  to all public higher education institutions. There are several media  reports  about the organisation funding research projects and  contributing  towards the maintenance of infrastructure and equipment in the education sector.  Africa Check found no report of the government institution giving out grants of N30,000 directly to individuals. The  link  in the Facebook post takes you to a page that requires you to answer some general questions. These include whether you’re a Nigerian citizen or not, and what you’ll use the money for.  Suspiciously , regardless of  your answers, you will be taken to the next step, and ultimately told that you qualify for the “grant”. The website also has what appears to be a screenshot of the comments section of a Facebook post. This shows comments from users who say they’ve received the funds and urge others to apply.  If you complete all the steps, you are taken to a blog titled “ Scholarships Infopedia ”.  This points to the Facebook  post  being a scam. It uses a tactic known as  engagement bait . By liking, commenting or sharing the post, users increase its reach, but there are no “grants” awarded.  By increasing the reach of the Facebook post, scammers are able to draw visitors to the website. Africa Check  debunked  a similar claim in 2021. Those posts also claimed that Tetfund was giving out N30,000 to Nigerian students. This turned out to be false and a scam.

In a  post , dated 24 July 2023, the account says: “DANGOTE INVESTMENT PLATFORM IS AN ONLINE TRADING PLATFORM THAT GIVES DOUBLE OF WHAT YOU INVESTED WITHIN 1HOUR AND 30MINUTES.” The text is accompanied by a video of former Nigerian lawmaker  Dino Melaye , calling on viewers to invest in the so-called Dangote investment platform.

TVC News  is a Nigerian broadcast station based in Lagos. The official Facebook page for the station is  Tvcnewsng . It  has a blue tick, meaning it’s  verified by Meta ,  the company which owns Facebook. The page in question is named  TVC News Nigeria . These names are very similar in an attempt to mislead Facebook users. The poorly written post is also a clue that the page is a scam. TVC News employs professional journalists and editors and one would expect all posts to be checked for errors before being published. The suspicious page has only 48 followers, while the  official TVC page  has over 345,000. The video in the post in question has only been viewed 160 times, a relatively low number. These are further red flags. Dangote Group  manufactures different products, including cements, sugars and salts. In May, the company  launched  a refinery to boost the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. But Africa Check found no media reports of Dangote ever launching an investment platform.  The group previously distanced itself from social media posts offering grants to Nigerians under the name “Dangote Empowerment”.  In a 2021  tweet , the company said: “ Our attention has been drawn to a fraudulent scheme circulating on WhatsApp and social media titled 2021 Dangote Empowerment purporting to be sanctioned by the Aliko Dangote Foundation.

Facebook accounts are now impersonating the platform, which no longer exists, in an attempt to scam users.","There are various investment companies that Nigerians can go to in order to grow their money. But there are also scammers taking advantage of desperate users on Facebook. A post by the Facebook page  Racksteli investment  reads: “WELCOME TO RACKSTERLI  ITS A PLATFORM WHERE YOU INVEST A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YOU GET IT BACK IN DOUBLE TO YOUR ACCOUNT IN LESS THAN 45MINUTES.” The  post , dated 13 July 2023, says the platform is not a Ponzi scheme and there is no delay in paying investors. In a  Ponzi scheme , earlier investors are paid with funds from new ones. The company usually promises high returns with little to no risk. The  post  also features a 59-second video of Nigerian singer,  David Adeleke , popularly known as Davido. Adeleke calls on viewers to invest in the platform, with the assurance that they will get their money back in 24 hours. The video has been viewed by more than 1,000 users.  Like many similar schemes we’ve debunked before, this post also has a WhatsApp link for interested users.  Similar posts can be found  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . So is this investment scheme legit? We checked. Africa Check found  several  media reports on Racksterli. Founded by Michael Oti, it was an  investment platform offering to double investors'  money within a short period of time. The platform used  celebrities  to gain the trust of potential investors. Davido and  Dino Melaye , a  former Nigerian lawmaker , are the most popular celebrities who promoted the platform.  Quam Adebola, a victim who spoke to financial news site  Nairametrics  in July 2022, said she was convinced to join the platform because of Davido's endorsement. Actors  Nancy Isime  and  William Uchemba  also  promoted  the scheme, alongside other celebrities, according to Nairametrics. Over 400,000 people who put their money in the scheme were scammed. Most of them never received their initial investment back, nor the double payouts promised to them. The investment platform crashed in June 2021, according to the Lagos-based  Foundation for Investigative Journalism . The poorly written post, riddled with grammatical errors, is the first sign that the page is a scam. A legitimate investment platform would be expected to publish well-written posts. The page also has just seven followers. A low number of followers on any social media page claiming to be credible is a red flag. Users could still be tricked with the promise of doubling their money in a short period of time. Hence it is important to approach such an offer with caution. Racksterli, MMM, Galaxy, and Brad Crash have all been identified by Nigeria’s  Economic and Financial Crime Commission  as Ponzi schemes that deceived the public. In a  tweet  in 2022, the commission cautioned the public to be wary of online investment programmes that promise quick and large returns.

But is this investment scheme another scam? We looked into it. A search for “Olymp Trade Investment” on Nigeria’s  business register  came up  empty . This is a red flag because even if a company is no longer operational, it would still appear on the register and be marked “inactive”. However, Africa Check found a trading platform called  Olymp Trade  on Facebook. The company’s page has over 1.4 million followers and carries the platform’s  verification badge .  It is an online-based platform that is “licensed and regulated by the  Vanuatu  Financial Services Commission”, according to its  website .  It says its core function is to support traders with market analysis and trading strategies in almost 140 countries. The suspicious Facebook posts refer to “Olymp Trade Investments” which could lead users to believe that they’re engaging and investing with the registered company. But there’s no clear evidence of this. None of the posts link to the trading platform’s verified Facebook page. We also did not find any similar promises on the official page as in the posts we were investigating. There’s no proof that the investment returns boasted about in the suspicious posts are real or linked to Olymp Trade. There are various ways to spot a scam on Facebook. One of the signs is the promise of large returns in a short period of time. In this case, the posts claim that investors’ money will be doubled within two hours. If something sounds too good to be true on social media, it usually is. In a  tweet  in 2022, Nigeria’s  Economic and Financial Crime Commission  warned the public about investing in businesses that offer unrealistic returns.

In 2022, Africa Check investigated a  similar claim  where several Facebook pages used the name of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and linked it to Helping Hand Investment. One of those pages was named  CBN Helping Hand Trading Investment . In a  tweet , the bank said it was not affiliated with any Facebook page offering investment opportunities to Nigerians. “The Central Bank of Nigeria wishes to dissociate itself from online schemes such as CBN Helping Hands Investment Programme purporting to be the bank's representative,” the bank  said on Twitter  in September 2022. (Twitter was  rebranded as X  in July 2023.) The Helping Hand investment platform was a scam then, and all signs point to it being a scam now. One of the signs of an  investment scam is poorly written communications. A  post  that tells users to “ Click on the whatsapp link now to chart the admin for registration payment is ongoin” raises suspicion. Another indication is when a post asks users to reach out via WhatsApp. Here the aim is often to obtain personal and banking details.   Nigeria’s  Corporate Affairs Commission  has a  record of an inactive  business named  Help Hands Investment Multipurpose Limited, but nothing on “Helping Hand Investment Platform”,  which is the company being promoted by the suspicious  post .

He is also the  world’s richest  person.  We found similar posts  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here ,  here  and  here . But is there such a giveaway by Musk and is the Facebook page to be trusted?  There are several signs that point to  Elon Musk Official Pager  being a fake Facebook page. One of them is that it has no followers. Musk has a huge following on social media, with over 153 million followers on  Twitter  alone.  In a  reply to a tweet  in 2018, Musk said he didn’t have a Facebook account. This also explains why the suspicious page is not  verified  by Meta. Another reg flag is the promise of a huge payout. The page claims users will get double of what they put in. The goal could be to lure users into making large deposits but never paying them the promised returns.  If Musk was running any kind of promotion like this one, it would have made international headlines. But there are no reports from credible news agencies of him giving away  5,000 Bitcoin (US$147,350,000 at the time of writing). The “Elon Musk Bitcoin giveaway” is a scam that has affected thousands of people across the world.  In 2021, the  British Broadcast Corporation (BBC)  reported how Julie Bushnell, a teacher, was conned into depositing £9,000 (approximately $11,500) with the hope of receiving double that amount back.  Africa Check found a  website  where more information about the supposed giveaway is shared.

22-Sep-23,"No, Nigerian singer Naira Marley not arrested over the death of artist Mohbad",Posts circulating on Facebook claim that Naira Marley and Sam Larry have been arrested over the death of Mohbad. But this is false information.,"A video circulating  on Facebook  purporting to show that Nigeria’s  Department of State Services  arresting the singer  Naira Marley  and socialite Samson Balogun, popularly known as  Sam Larry . This claim follows controversial rumours on social media after the sudden death on 12 September 2023 of Nigerian singer Aloba Promise, better known as  Mohbad . Mohbad, 27, was signed to Marlian Records, owned by Marley, himself one of the country’s biggest stars, in  2019 . Mohbad left the label in  2022 . He said in more than one Instagram  live session  that Marley should be held responsible for his death if anything ever happened to him. Marley  has called  for an exhaustive investigation into the circumstances of the death. The death also shone a light on how musicians in the country are treated by labels  including claims of bullying . The  video  has been viewed 2.4 million times and “liked” 94,000 times at time of publication. It was also shared  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  Has Marley been arrested and is it linked to Mohbad’s death? Mohbad was buried by his family the day after his death, fuelling widespread anger and suspicion about how he died. He has now  been exhumed . Since  his death  his fans and other celebrities have called for  justice  with  the hashtag #justiceformohbad trending on X, formerly Twitter. There have  also been protests . However, according to a  report  in the  Punch newspaper , Marley wasn’t arrested and neither the state services department nor the police have detained anyone over Mohbad’s death.  The spokesperson for the Lagos annex of the police’s criminal investigations department, Oluniyi Ogundeyi, told Punch: “The report is false; it is a lie; no one has been arrested. The police did not arrest Naira Marley or Sam Larry.”  On 18 September, the Lagos state police command set up a panel to  probe the death of the musician . The state’s governor  has also promised  a thorough investigation. However, at time of publication on 22 September, no arrests have been made.",FALSE
9-Apr-25,No evidence of retaliatory attack by Hausa group against Igbos in northern Nigeria,"The Nigerian government, politicians and religious groups have condemned the killing of 16 Hausa hunters in Edo state. But we found no evidence to support claims that a group of Hausas attacked an Igbo market and killed six men in retaliation.","On 27 March 2025, 16 travellers from northern Nigeria were  killed  by a  mob  in the southern state of Edo.  The  victims , who said they were Hausa hunters and were suspected of being  kidnappers , were travelling from  Port Harcourt  to  Kano . According to the  police , they were attacked after being stopped by a vigilante group.  In this context,  several  Facebook  posts  claim that a group of armed Hausas invaded an Igbo market and killed six men in  retaliation  for the Edo incident.  Part of one post, dated 31 March,  reads : “Breaking News: Happening now, at least six Igbo men have been killed and ten others injured as a group of armed Hausa youths invaded an Igbo market in the North, attacking anyone in sight. This attack is reportedly in retaliation for the recent incident in Edo, where Edo youths killed 16 Northern terrorists who had been terrorizing their communities for a long time.” The  Igbos   are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nigeria. They live mainly in the southeastern part of the country, while t he  Hausas  live mainly in northern Nigeria. The same  claim  appears  here ,  here ,  here  and  here .  But is it true? We checked. Lack of evidence Nigeria has grappled with ethnic clashes for  years , with most incidents making headlines. But Africa Check found no credible media reports of such a retaliatory attack against the Igbos in the north. Some  politicians  and  religious organisations  condemned the Edo attack, while president Bola Tinubu  ordered  a manhunt for the killers. We would expect the same to happen if the claim of a retaliatory attack were true. The  Nigeria Police Force  also released a  statement  on the Edo incident. We searched the police force’s  X account  and  website  for a statement on the alleged retaliatory attack and came up empty.  Misinformation like this can further fuel ethnic tensions and lead to more deadly clashes.",FALSE
9-Apr-25,"No, photos of burnt vehicles depicting a retaliatory attack against Igbos in Kano are old and unrelated to Edo mob action","A fatal attack on Hausa people in Edo state, Nigeria has triggered a wave of rumours of retaliatory attacks against local Igbos. But the photos used as evidence of these retaliations are old, and the police have denied such an attack took place in Kano state, as claimed on social media.","Social media users have  posted   photos  of a burnt vehicle, with the claim they show the aftermath of an attack on Igbo travellers by Fulani men in Kano state, Nigeria. One  such post , published 29 March 2025, reads, in part: “Tragically, 18 Igbos lost their lives this morning while travelling back to the East. A violent Fulani mob ambushed their bus, set it ablaze, and left no survivors. Everything put Igbos on Target.”  The Fulani ethnic group are found in the northern region of Nigeria, while the Igbo are primarily from the southeast. On 27 March 2025 travellers, suspected to be  kidnappers  from northern Nigeria, were  killed  by  a mob  in  Uromi  in Edo state.  The  victims  were Hausa hunters who were travelling from  Port Harcourt , in the south-south geopolitical zone, to  Kano  for  Eid al-Fitr  celebrations when they were intercepted by vigilantes in Edo. Eid al-Fitr marks the end of  Ramadan , the Muslim month of  fasting .  Nigerian leaders  and institutions have  condemned  the attack, urging for justice and  peace .  It’s in this context that the claim has surfaced about Fulani men burning a vehicle, killing Igbo passengers.  The same claim can be found  here  and  here .  (Note: See more instances at the end of this report.) But do the photos of burnt vehicles show the aftermath of an attack against Igbos? We checked. Old photos Africa Check  ran  a  reverse   photo   search  of the photos included as evidence of the claim and found  one of them  published by Punch newspaper  in 2023 . It was   reported  that the 14 passengers in the vehicle were unhurt when it was gutted by fire on the  Lagos-Ibadan expressway. We found  another of the photos  in a 2022  report  about seven people burnt to death on the  Sagamu-Benin expressway . We found  another one  in a  report from 2020  about nine people who were killed along the  Benin-Ore expressway  when a bus burst into flames. We found  another photo  in a  report from 2020  about a  Boko Haram  terrorist attack in Borno state, northeastern Nigeria, where 65 people were killed. What we could not find were any credible news reports of an attack on a bus carrying Igbo passengers in March 2025. If the claim were real, it would have been reported by the media. Abdullahi Kiyawa, Kano state police spokesperson, also told the media it was “ fake news ”. The claim is an example of misinformation that could incite violence and should be ignored.
