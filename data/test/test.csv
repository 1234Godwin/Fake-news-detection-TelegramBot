"Claim : A Twitter user shared a picture of a flooded mud classroom alleged to have happened in Nigeria. Verdict: The image used to depict the state of classrooms in Nigeria is falsely used. The image is originally from Kenya and was first shared in 2019. Omoaka Christopher ( @leroikris ) tweeted a narrative with a rather disturbing picture of some students. They sat, on clay moulded blocks, in a cob building that is alleged to be their classroom. Hinged on the cracked-riddled walls of the structure appears to be their books packed in polythene bags. While their legs are stretched forward to avoid the flooded floor, their gloomy faces cast the hopelessness of their reality; one of the claimants said he would not wish such for the children of his enemies. Mr Christopher, who subt ly implies the picture depicts the state of primary education in Nigeria, then suggests a solution, advising users to save the image as a reminder to vote wisely in the upcoming general elections in Nigeria, adding that Labour Party (LP) will guarantee a better Nigeria. Just look at this picture. Would you even want your enemies children to be in classrooms of this nature? Save it on your phone as a reminder when you go to the polling station on 25 February 2023. You will vote LP for a better Nigeria, he tweeted. Like most politically motivated claims online, the post generated over a thousand views, with some reactions and retweets. Many experts have criticised President Buharis administration for poor governance. In 2020, Nigerias GDP had a negative growth rate of 3.2% due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by 2022, data shows the countrys expenditure on education has reduced to about four to five per cent of the annual budget, while private education increased rapidly. Even worse, in 2022, the floods ravaged over 34 states out of 36, displacing over 2.8 million people and killing many, attracting criticism and concern over the state of things in Nigeria. Perhaps, based on this context, Mr Christopher is building this alleged narrative. But is the picture from Nigeria? DUBAWA first conducted a Google reverse image search on the alleged image to track its origin online. The results revealed the image has been online since 2019, and its surrounding narratives have much to do with Kenya, not Nigeria. In 2019, the image went viral in the Kenyan social media space. The origin narrative depicted students of Mangororomu Primary school in Ganze, Kilifi, Kenya, sitting on mud blocks as their classroom is filled with rainwater. It was first published by The Star News, a Kenyan-based digital platform, on May 9. 2019, with the headline: Uproar as Kilifi children taught in flooded classroom Tuko, an award-winning digital news platform in Kenya, also published a news story on the picture, with the headline: Kilifi: Netizens angered by a viral photo of pupils sitting on bricks in flooded classroom Both the news sources detail how barefooted pupils sat on stone blocks as muddy rainwater swirled around them in a leaking mud-wall classroom in Ganze constituency, Kilifi, Kenya, not in Nigeria. DUBAWA found that the image was also used elsewhere to misinform the public. In November 2022, the same image was falsely used to depict the state of classrooms in Boki, Cross River, in Nigeria. However, an Africa Checks fact-check debunked the claim, linking it to the Kenyan narrative. The alleged image used to depict the state of classrooms in Nigeria is falsely used. The image is originally from Kenya and was first shared in 2019.",1
"Claim: A Twitter user claims that the cost for the ECOWAS 1,000 km Lagos-Abidjan highway is N167 billion. The claim that the cost for the ECOWAS 1,000 km Lagos-Abidjan highway is N167 billion is false. Findings show the highway was totaled to cost $2 billion which is N831 billion. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was established on May 28, 1975, via the treaty of Lagos. The 15-member regional group has a mandate to promote economic integration in all fields of activity of the constituting countries. It is courtesy of these goals that the ECOWAS set out to begin an action plan on the construction of the 1,028kilometers Lagos-Abidjan road. The road will connect Lagos, Cotonou, Lome, Accra, and Abidjan. The road project is now a point of a Twitter controversy. One user, Damzy (@Segun_Odunayo)claims that ECOWAS is constructing the 1,000 km Lagos/Abidjan road for N167 billion. The tweet was received with mixed signals; while some users argued that the information was incorrect, others simply consented to the statement. Is there a standard template for determining the costs of these roads? Though it could be more expensive when you compare it with that Lagos-Abidjan road. Perhaps there are complexities that make it so expensive. Just giving the benefit of doubt, Babatope Falade (@FaladeBabatope) questioned. The claimant brought into his narrative the N9.9 billion 35km Oyo-Iseyin road, suggesting that the cost is outrageous compared to ECOWAS N167 billion road project. No doubt, the cost of infrastructural projects has always been a point of controversy. In recent years, both public office holders and citizens have made claims around topics that have turned out to be misleading, thus putting public trust in doubt and arousing more questions than usual. When Dubawa conducted a search on the actual amount of money that was set aside for the ECOWAS Lagos-Abidjan 1, 000km highway, the results show multiple credible media outlets had reported that the highway was set to cost $2billion. A report by Road Traffic Technology stated that the highway is expected to cost around $2bn. It will connect Cote dIvoires commercial capital, Abidjan, to Lagos in Nigeria. The same report was also published in the Nation Newspaper, with the headline: Lagos-Abidjan highway to cost $2bn. Also, there is a detailed report on ECOWAS website that provides all the necessary information regarding the Lagos-Abidjan highway, including the partners in the project. To establish a base for the claim, DUBAWA reached out to the claimant, Segun Odunayo, via a phone call. Mr Odunayo explained he had received the intel from a source he considers credible but cannot declare openly. He added that the N167 billion he mentioned was an additional fund ECOWAS was seeking to complete the project. A lot of people who saw the tweet misunderstood me, he said. The information I tweeted was the intel I got from my source, and I trust his findings. Mr Odunayo however failed to give this clarification in his tweet. But did ECOWAS ever seek for more funds aside the $2 billion? DUBAWA uncovered that The Cable has once published a news report on how the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) was seeking additional funds for constructing the $2 billion Lagos-Abidjan highway project. The lead in the report details that the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is seeking additional funds for constructing the $2 billion Lagos-Abidjan highway project. It further explains how ECOWAS and the African Development Bank (AfDB) signed a $22.7 million (N 9,152 billion) loan agreement as an additional funding to make up for $2billion for the project (not more funds aside the $2billion). This $22.7 billion dollar contract between the AfDB and ECOWAS was only a fraction of the $2billion not an addition to it. ECOWAS had a funding gap and needed additional funds to make up for $2billion. Thus, the extra funds needed by ECOWAS was not an additional to the total sum of $2billion but a make up of it. DUBAWA also reached out to ECOWAS for further comments about the actual amount of the highway project and if it has sought more funds amounting to N167 billion aside the initial $2billion. All attempts via phone calls and emails were not replied as at the time this copy was published. Notably, the naira-dollar exchange rates for April 2013, (the official year and month that the Lagos-Abidjan was launched by ECOWAS) indicated that the $2 billion was still equivalent to N312 billion not N167 billion. DUBAWAS findings contradicts the claimants assertion; the total funds for the highway was costed at $2billion (N831 billion) not $167 billion. Even in 2013, when the project was first announced, the N312 billion was the naira equivalent of $2billion not 167 billion. Hence, this claim is false.",0
"Claim: A viral clip on Facebook and WhatsApp shows foreign students protesting and calling Nigerias president a thief. Verdict: True. In August, students protested outside the Nigerian High Commission in London against President Tinubus anti-poor policies, demanding the release of Nigerians arrested during the #EndBadGovernance protest in Nigeria. In August 2024, Nigeria witnessed a series of protests as citizens took to the streets, expressing their frustrations over increasing economic hardships and calling for urgent government intervention. Protests often draw widespread attention, especially in a country where the public is eager for any sign of change or response to their demands. It is, therefore, no surprise that videos purporting to show protests or demonstrations resonate with Nigerian audiences, sparking discussions across social media. Recently, a video began circulating online, allegedly showing foreign students protesting and accusing President Bola Tinubu of theft. The 19-second clip featured a mix of white and black individuals holding placards with the chant, When I say Tinubu, you say thief. The video spread across platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook, with multiple shares and engagements (see links here, here , here , here , here , here , here , and here ). The post that particularly drew DUBAWAs attention was shared by Sahara Reporters , a platform known for promoting misleading narratives, which raised further suspicion about the videos authenticity. Published on Oct. 6, 2024, the post by Sahara Reporters had amassed 1,300 likes, 527 comments, 350 shares, and 53,900 plays by the time it was reviewed. Reactions varied, with users like @BabangidaIbrahim commenting, Thiefnubu is now recognised as an international thief. After just a year and a half in power, what an achievement. Another user, @HenryOghifo , expressed frustration, We have the worst generation of students and undergraduates in the history of Nigeria. Imagine, not one campus was captured on camera protesting hunger and bad governance during the 1 October nationwide protest. Didnt NANS see students in America protesting the Israeli genocidal war on Gaza on campus grounds? In contrast, @Ibrahim Muhammed speculated, This was sponsored by Atiku Abubakar. However, not everyone agreed. As @Nwudu Austin wrote, This is a Fake video. No foreign national has the right to insult our president. Yes, we are not happy with his policies, but he is still our president. Screenshot of the viral video. The video gained significant attention, with many sharing it as evidence of international condemnation of President Tinubus actions. Yet, a closer examination of the video raised doubts about its authenticity. Several elements cast suspicion on the claim. Firstly, some placards held by the protesters bore messages that didnt seem to align with the claim, Nigeria or its president, with one reading, Fight for socialism, Socialist Students, and another, Drop all charges and release protesters. Furthermore, the audio did not align with the crowds energy in the footage, suggesting a potential mismatch. Given these inconsistencies, DUBAWA launched an investigation into the videos authenticity. Using a screenshot from the clip, we searched Google Lens, which resulted in many random images and videos that did not match the intended query. For more specific results, DUBAWA used keywords from the placards and conducted an advanced search. This eventually led to Facebook and X ( formerly Twitter) accounts named Socialist Students, which featured the same colours and logo as those used by the protesters in the clip. The Socialist Students account, based in the United Kingdom, describes itself as a campaigning organisation fighting against cuts, fees, war, racism, sexism, and homophobia. Further searches led to a published report containing the exact image from the protest. The report detailed that a group of London students, including Nigerian, British, and international students, protested outside the Nigerian High Commission to condemn the countrys anti-poor policies and demand the release of political prisoners. Inspired by the #EndBadGovernance movement in Nigeria, the demonstration highlighted the plight of activists arrested during mass protests in August. The search added that Socialist Students supported the protest organised by Nigeria Solidarity UK. In a statement, they expressed solidarity with workers and young people in Nigeria against the repressive measures of the Tinubu government. Protesters were reported to have received a positive response from High Commission staff, with one member even encouraging them to continue their efforts. The protesters said Nigerias ongoing political and economic crisis has impacted international students, leading to higher tuition fees and the risk of exclusion. This issue has fueled further activism, with Socialist Students previously campaigning against the deportation of Nigerian students unable to afford their education. An X user, Francis Nwapa , confirmed the incident in a tweet, stating: A group of socialist students were in front of the Nigerian High Commission, WC2N 5BX, in London today, staging a protest against @officialABATs anti-poor policies and demanding that all trumped-up charges against Nigerians who were illegally arrested, detained, and incarcerated be dropped. Vanguard News also shared a similar report. The X account of Socialist Students also reshared the clip originally posted by Sahara Reporters, further confirming that it is the same incident. While different social media posts show that the incident occurred, many reputable media platforms did not report it. We also conducted a keyword search on YouTube to find the video or any version of it. We found a version by Naija Library from three weeks ago and reactionary videos by African-German First Lady TV and Spicechanneltv . Lastly, Deepware .ai was used to scrutinise the video and the results were positive. Upon further examination of the results, the tool provided a detailed percentage breakdown indicating the videos authenticity level. The breakdown included Deepware at 5%, Saferbekov at 10%, and Ensemble at 15%. These are sub-tools employed by deepware.ai to assess the likelihood of a video being fabricated. In simpler terms, the tool suggests that the clip did not detect elements of a deepfake. DUBAWAs findings confirm that the protest in question did take place. It was organised by Nigeria Solidarity UK with support from Socialist Students against the repressive measures of Tinubus government.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp broadcast message asserts that warm water cures many human diseases. Verdict: False. Although available medical resource materials highlight certain health conditions that warm water prevents, they do not suggest that it cures them. Moreover, medical doctors have dismissed the claim as untrue. Water is widely considered an essential food nutrient. Medically speaking , water takes up a great deal of the human bodys mass. Although it cannot be specifically stated how long one can go without water, dehydration has been judged to cause thirst, fatigue, organ failure, and even death. However, a viral broadcast message is being circulated on Metas end-to-end encryption messaging application, WhatsApp, highlighting a host of illnesses that warm water can cure. In the viral post, WhatsApp users are asked to share with family and friends a long list of human diseases that warm water can cure, including migraine, high blood pressure, epilepsy, asthma, and whooping cough. A group of Japanese doctors confirmed that warm water is 100 (per cent) effective in resolving some health problems such as migraine, high blood pressure, low blood pressure, joint (pain), sudden increase and decrease of heartbeat Part of the message read. A screenshot of the viral WhatsApp post A screenshot of the viral WhatsApp post Due to the virality of the post and the harmful repercussions it could have on the countrys citizens if it were discovered to be untrue, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA located credible medical journal outlets that listed and described the body ailments that warm water could cure. However, we noticed that they only highlighted all the benefits of warm water consumption, without any mention of warm waters curative power. Healthline mentions that warm water intake can relieve nasal congestion, aid digestion, improve the central nervous system, relieve constipation, keep one hydrated, reduce shivering during colds, improve circulation, decrease stress levels, detoxify the body system, and relieve achalasia symptoms. MedicalNewsToday also corroborates Healthline, adding that warm water reduces body weight and pain. PharmEasy likewise highlights the benefits of warm water including constipation prevention and metabolism acceleration. In a brief interaction with Dr Olubode Kayode, a medical doctor at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Ido Ekiti, Ekiti State, he explicitly told DUBAWA that the claim was a fallacy. He referenced the existence of contemporary pharmaceutical advancement and stated that if warm water cures a host of the diseases mentioned, then drugs would be needless. Dr Kayode, however, mentioned that water has benefits that help the body system, but such benefits cannot be substituted as a cure for human diseases. He also noted that, people who believe such claims only end up in the hospital with obvious health complications. DUBAWA came across a fact check, relevant to the claim and published by the International Centre for Investigative Reporting (ICIR) , where we noticed what other medical doctors have said about the matter. According to the ICIR, Dr Opeyemi Adeyemi, a medical doctor at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), expressly stated that warm water only benefits but does not cure any disease. Warm water has benefits but doesnt cure an ailment. Once somebody has been diagnosed with an ailment, warm water will not affect or cure the disease, she told the ICIR. Dr Femi Ajose, another medical doctor at the same teaching hospital, queried how a single antidote can cure various human illnesses. He dismissed it as highly non-scientific. The claim is false. Both medical journals and medical professionals indicate that although warm water does offer certain benefits to human beings, it cannot cure any disease.",0
"CLAIM: A Twitter user, IperuBoy ( @Iperu_Boy ), claims that the APC gubernatorial candidate in Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, led thugs to snatch ballot boxes at Iperu, Ikenne local government. FINDING: Punch Journalist Ojuroungbe Sodiq, who was at the scene, stated that although thugs snatched ballot boxes, it was difficult to ascertain who was responsible. Also, Mr Abiodun did not appear in the pictures attached to the tweet. VERDICT: MISLEADING SOURCE: Punch Journalist, Picture forensic DATE: 19/3/2023",1
"Claim: Viral reports claimed home remedies such as insecticides, kerosene mixed with substances like camphor kill head lice. There is no sufficient evidence that the home remedies mentioned could cure head lice but they are believed to be rather dangerous to human health. Social media is awash with success stories of do-it-yourself remedies for head lice, a very dreaded disease common among females. Platforms such as YouTube are replete with videos showing how people reportedly got rid of lice using the various home remedies and urging the public to do the same. One of such is this user who applied kerosene to a louse placed in a basin. In the video, she proved that kerosene could kill the louse. Another user recently gave the same advice. Also, groups on Facebook, most especially those with titles such as Do-it-yourself Home Remedies among others, also are places where claims regarding hair lice are shared. With over thousands of followers, the group members with such problems seek advice on how to get rid of hair lice and bring up age-long practices such as the application of insecticide to get rid of hair lice. Some also have recommended the use of Kerosene mixed with camphor as a head lice treatment as seen here , here and here . Others have advised people with this challenge to make use of pain-relieving balm such as Aboniki balm on the affected head because of the healing ability of the ointment. This is despite stories of those who have been killed by these remedies, particularly a corps member in 2019 who applied Sniper insecticide to get rid of head lice in 2019. Also, in 2020 , a young woman was advised by her hairdresser to apply the same insecticide on the scalp of her two daughters to get rid of hair lice. While one died, the other was saved after much effort by medical practitioners. According to Medical News Today , head lice (singular louse) are tiny, wingless, parasitic insects that live in human hair. They are a common problem and highly contagious. They can also be hard to get rid of. The eggs are known as nits They live in the hair on ones head and feed off the blood from the scalp. While head lice move from person to person, there is insufficient evidence to prove that it can be transmitted via inanimate objects such as comb, pieces of clothing of the affected persons among others. However, while it has been said that head lice do not pose a very serious medical threat, they may cause the carrier to be uncomfortable, causing severe itching. It has also been emphasized that having head lice does not mean the carrier is dirty. These pesky creatures dont fly or jump they crawl over to the closest head they can find. This is called head-to-head contact, and most people get lice this way. But they also can spread onto hats, helmets, combs, bedding Dubawa contacted Gogo James Owo, a clinical pathologist with De-Integrated Medical Diagnostics and Research Laboratories, Port Harcourt, Rivers State, who warned strictly against the use of kerosene/camphor, insecticide and other pesticides in getting rid of head lice. He said such home remedies are inimical to health. I will advise that people stay away from using Sniper because the active ingredient in Sniper pesticide is Bifenthrin. It is a highly toxic organic pollutant. When bifenthrin gets on the skin, it can cause tingling, itching, burning, or numbness at the site of contact. The sensations usually go away within 48 hours. However, inhaling bifenthrin can irritate the nose, throat, and lungs and in severe cases, respiratory damage is observed, he said. He also highlighted reasons why kerosene should never be applied to the scalp or any part of the body. Kerosene poisoning can cause symptoms in various parts of the body: it can cause breathing difficulty (from inhalation), it may cause throat swelling and the person may develop abdominal pain. Exposure to kerosene can also cause a person to start stooling blood, develop low blood pressure, convulsions, coma, dizziness among others. He suggested the use of Dimethicone, a highly effective head lice treatment lotion, with a low risk of adverse effects. Two applications of dimethicone one week apart results in successful eradication of lice in at least 70% of patients. Dimethicone is not an insecticide. It kills lice by suffocation and disrupting their ability to regulate water, Owo said. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention also listed pediculicides (lice medicine) as the treatment for head lice. It also stated that there are many head lice over-the-counter medications. It noted that over-the-counter products approved by the FDA for the treatment of head lice contain one of the following active ingredients: pyrethrins combined with piperonyl butoxide; permethrin lotion. Supplemental tips to be followed by people trying to get rid of lice infestations include: washing the hair with shampoo and using a nit comb; vacuuming furniture and floors, washing clothing worn or used by the infested person using hot water as lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5 minutes to temperatures greater than 53.5C (128.3F). It also warned against fumigant sprays stating, insecticide sprays are not recommended and can be harmful to people and animals. The use of insecticide, kerosene for head lice removal can be dangerous. A person infested with head lice can consult a doctor if the over the counter remedies are not effective. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari fellowship in partnership with SaharaReporters to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"In the first week of April, we came across several claims online and questions posed to the DUBAWA chatbot. Below is a listicle of the top and trending claims investigated by DUBAWA during the week. Earlier in the month, 16 travellers alleged to be kidnappers were lynched after they were found with local guns and machetes. This incident generated controversy across various social media, with users expressing fear of a possible reprisal attack on the Igbo people. In light of this, a claim started circulating across Facebook and other social media platforms that the Northerners had attacked a bus conveying Igbo travellers from Kano State. DUBAWA investigated the claim, which was shared alongside images of a burning vehicle. Our findings revealed that the image was unrelated to the Edo lynching and was not as recent as claimed. A Facebook user, Abdulrahman Shakundum , via video, claimed that there was an assassination attempt on Russian President Vladimir Putin while he was in his car. The claim started spreading a few days into the negotiation plan between the warring countries, Russia and Ukraine, initiated by the United States government. DUBAWAs i nvestigation confirmed the incident, revealing this is not the first assassination attempt on Putin. A Facebook user shared a post claiming that Wike collapsed during a meeting in Abuja due to excess alcohol intake. The user asserted the claim with three pictures, allegedly showing scenes from the collapse of the FCT minister in Abuja. As gathered by DUBAWA, this was not the first time the former River State governor has been accused of excessive alcohol intake. DUBAWA noticed the incredulous nature of the claim and the level of engagement it attracted, so we decided to investigate it. Our findings revealed that the three images shared by the claimant are old and unrelated to the Ministers alleged health. Furthermore, the media aide to the FCT minister, Lere Olayinka, has refuted the circulating claim, describing it as false and misleading. On Mar. 25, 2025, a Facebook user uploaded an image of PDPs Acting National Chairperson, Umar Damagum, claiming his resignation. Many users found the claim convincing, as it was allegedly sourced from Arise News, a broadcast station in Nigeria. DUBAWA r esearch led us to several reports by credible media outlets debunking the claim about the resignation of the acting PDP National Chairperson as false. Meanwhile, the party has dismissed the claim as politically motivated, urging the public to disregard the malicious information. Therefore, the claim is false.",1
"Claim: Facebook users shared a picture of a letter alleging that the current speaker of the Lagos state House of Assembly, Mojisola Meranda, has resigned. Verdict: FALSE. No credible media organisation reported such an occurrence. Also, the assemblys information officer, Bisola Branco-Adekoya, debunked the claim. The internal battle at the Lagos state legislative house reached a crescendo on Jan. 13, 2025, when members impeached the long-serving speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, over allegations of gross misconduct and abuse of office. His deputy, Mojisola Meranda, was chosen by the assemblys majority to succeed him while he was in the United States. Since then, the hallowed chambers have experienced various turmoils. The latest controversy was the premises invasion by officials of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigerian Police, who sealed the offices of the Speaker, her deputy, and the clerk. On Feb. 17, 2025, Lagos State House of Assembly members responded by passing a vote of confidence in Meranda, affirming their trust in her leadership. However, alleged news of her resignation suddenly surfaced online, as depicted in a letter attributed to the 44-year-old lawmaker representing Apapa Constituency 1. A Facebook page, Nigeria News Now that shared the letter gained 11 reactions, 11 comments, and three reshares in seven hours. However, the claim gained more reactions here , here , and here . The informations implications for the newly elected speakers reputation and the stability of the Assembly prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA conducted an advanced keyword search and found no credible media report on the alleged incident. We also contacted Folashade Ogunrinde, a Premium Times reporter covering the South West. She contacted the assemblys chief public affairs officer, Bisola Branco-Adekoya, who described the claim as false. DUBAWA attempted to contact Ms Branco-Adekoya through WhatsApp messages and calls, but she did not respond when the report was filed. We identified several discrepancies when we manually analysed the document, casting doubt on its credibility. Publicly accessible documents from public officeholders like governors and speakers bear the writers appended signature. However, the viral letter has none, though the officials initials and contact details were added. The insignia on the document also had Office of the Speaker written around the states coat of arms. This differed from the insignia in the speakers office , which reads, Office of the Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly. The words completely circled the legislative houses emblem, a hand holding the mace with the states Coat of Arms at the head. After carefully comparing the viral letter with logos associated with Lagos state government officials, DUBAWA discovered that the false documents insignia was a manipulated form of the governors version. Information from credible sources and manual analyses revealed that the viral letter was manipulated. It is a mischievous attempt to depict the speaker bowing to pressure falsely.",0
"Claim: Photo showing the statue of Victor Osimhen in Napoli. Verdict: The image was sourced from the internet, doctored and used to push a false narrative. On April 13, 2024, Emeka Yankee , a Facebook user, posted the photograph of a monument said to be the statue of Victor Osimhen in Napoli. Describing the picture, he wrote: Status of Victor Osimehn in Napoli. No, forget to follow Emeka Yankee. Mr Osimhen, 25, is a professional footballer from Nigeria. He plays as a striker for the Nigerian national team and Serie A club in Napoli, a city in Southern Italy. The footballer is famous for his record-breaking transfer to Napoli in 2020 at about 70 million, making him the most expensive African player in history at the time. In June 2023, Angu Lesley , an X user, made a similar claim . He attached the same image to his post: VICTOR OSIMHENs STATUE has erected in NAPOLI to honour him for bringing them back their pride. What a historic gesture!!! Considering the subjects prominence and the recurring nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to carry out this fact check. Upon close inspection of the image, we noticed several odd aspects. Although artisans can craft lifelike sculptures, the image appears like a photograph. So, we conducted a keyword search on Google. This revealed multiple blog posts supporting the same claim under examination. We then conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the photo. This led us to a replica of the image. However, it was a typical statue and not of the football star. The alleged statue of Mr Osimhen. Photo Source: Grandenapoli. In the images above, item number one shows the photo of Mr Osimehn and the statue of Dante Alighieri, an Italian poet and philosopher. The Dante Alighieri statue , found in Napoli, Italy, was inaugurated on July 13, 1871. The monument was created by two sculptorsTito Angelini and Tommaso Solari juniorand placed on a base designed by Gherardo Rega. As it can be perceived, Mr Alighieris statue was removed from the base and replaced with the footballers photograph, perhaps through Photoshop. Item two on the images is identical. It depicts a woman sitting while a man wearing a black t-shirt and a baseball cap stands before her. The scene becomes clearer in the second image, where additional people stand beside them. This suggests that the original image was cropped. Two noticeable details in item three: individuals seated next to a parked bicycle and two white canopies across the square. Furthermore, we analysed the viral image using Invid , an image verification tool. The result flagged the entire area where Mr Osimhens photo appeared, confirming that this image had been doctored. We also pinpointed the exact location of the piece of art through Google Maps. A street view image from April 2023 confirmed that it remains in place. Our findings proved that the image used to depict Mr Osimhens statue in Napoli was doctored. The claim is false.",0
"Claim: Colonel Assimi Goita threatens Nigeria with Abuja invasion and promises to reinstate the rightful winner of the 2023 presidential election if ECOWAS invades Niger. Verdict: FALSE. Available news reports that announced the declaration provided no context that suggests that Colonel Goita made such threats. A Facebook handle, identified as Labour Party Plateau State Chapter, posted a statement allegedly made by the military leader and interim president of the West African State, Mali, declaring to make a counter-invasion on Nigerias state capital, Abuja, if the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) progresses with its agenda to invade Niamey, the capital of Niger. The military leader was also alleged to have asserted to the four-month-old Nigerian government that they are fully aware of the true victor of the presidential elections with the threat of reinstating the winner. If ECOWAS dares to invade Niamey, Niger, not only are we intervening, but we will simultaneously militarily invade Abuja, the capital of Nigeria, to reinstate the rightful winner of the 2023 elections, part of the statement reads. The same claim has been shared by several handles on Facebook, including here , here , here , here and here . On Saturday, July 26, 2023, the government of the Republic of Niger was seize d and taken over by the presidential guard under the charge of General Abdourahamne Tchiani. Its ousted President, Mohamed Bazoum, has since been kept under house arrest . However, the militarys sacking of the democratically elected president of the Sahel country has attracted a swarm of criticisms both from West African countries and foreign nations such as the United States and France. It has also sparked discussions in the European Union community. ECOWAS has repeatedly made unsuccessful appeals, including a looming invasion threat , to the military junta to restore power to the overthrown democratic government, a request the countrys military leader, General Tchiani, has blatantly refused. The military leader has even proposed a three-year interval before another transition into civilian rule in the insurgency-torn country. Since posted on Facebook, the alleged statement has received 179 likes and has been shared 49 times as of Sunday, August 27, 2023. The comments in the post partly resonated with the anomalies witnessed in the presidential election that have made people express doubt and dissatisfaction with its outcome that saw President Tinubus entrance into Aso Rock. True Nigerians know who won the presidential election, asserted Ikyemye Aondoakula Michael. What a mess Tinubu has turned Nigeria into. This is so disgusting and disturbing A disgruntled Bamijaiye Kolade Michael commented . Due to the sensitivity of the claim, and the strained ties between Niger and ECOWAS, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. We conducted a keyword search related to the details of the claim and found out that the post was reported by Gist Mania , Kemi Filani News , News Now Nigeria (NNNG) , and Ghana Web . Nairaland Forum has gone in the way of the lot but has taken the post down. However, what was noticeable about the reports (although they all carried the same version of the story) was that all claimed the Malian military leader made the threat while addressing the press recently. We searched for the press addresses that Colonel Goita had done recently, and we found related stories published by American-based Cable News Network (CNN) , Nigerian Tribune , and Voice of Nigeria (VON) . The reports showed the Colonel confirmed that he indeed had a phone call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, where the latter had pushed for the establishment of peace in a politically-disturbed Niger. We also came across a news story by Islam Chan nel informing of Nigers greenlight to neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso countries to intervene with their military forces within its national territories per adventure of an external invasion. According to the report, this is in reaction to the meeting held by ECOWAS in Ghana, declaring a combined force on the ground, ready to fall upon the Tchiani-led military junta whenever the order is given. We looked closely at other credible news outlets about the development to see if there was any point in the joint declaration that Colonel Goita spoke of moving a counter-invasion on Nigerias state capital, Abuja. International news outlet Reuters detailed its account of a similar story. Also, they included that the joint declaration was announced by the three allies foreign ministers when they met in Nigers capital Niamey. Voice of Africa (VOA) reiterates the same narration. But in none of the accounts is it mentioned or reported that Colonel Goita declared a counterattack in Abuja or threatened to install a particular winner of an election to power. The claim is false. Available credible news reports that announced the declaration provided no context suggesting that Colonel Goita made such statements or threats. Finally, Mali was physically represented by its foreign minister in the joint announcement of military intervention in Niger with Burkina Faso.",0
"Claim: An X user claimed that over 70 per cent of Nigerias population is illiterate. Verdict: False! The most recent data from the Ministry of Education puts the estimated number of non-literate Nigerians at 31 per cent. Amidst the ongoing feud between Senator Natasha Apoti and Godswill Akpabio, the Senate President, a video emerged on social media, showing a group of women in Kogi state purportedly gathered in an attempt to recall Senator Natasha. While tweeting his opinion about the incident, Shehu Sadiq , an X user, said the women in the video were illiterate. Sadiq ascribed the failure of democracy to mass illiteracy and poverty and also claimed that over 70 per cent of Nigerians are illiterate. Sadiqs post generated heated debates among other users. While some argue differently, several others, like @UchennaObi36947 , wrote: I agree with you, my good friend, but you must know too that exposure is part of education, and 90% of the northern populace are not exposed, and 70% of the 70% of Nigeria illiterates you mentioned are northerners too. @brenokwaraji , another user, said the figure was higher: 90% actually. Some PhD holders are also in this category, he responded. DUBAWA conducted this verification to ease the brewing controversy and set the record straight. Illiteracy is not just about not being able to read and write. It is often a result of deeper issues like poor access to education, harsh living conditions, and a lack of exposure to reading early on. Poverty makes it worse, and social factors like gender, ethnicity, and class also make things even harder. A 2022 estimation released by the Federal Ministry of Education pegs Nigerias current illiteracy level at 31 per cent. As of 2025, the media and Federal Government are still using this data because no other recent data is available. On the other hand, Nigerias literacy rate is 69%, which, according to development aid , is a 17% increase over the last 15 years. While these data may be too old to show the actual realities in the Nigerian society of today, they remain what is available. Data showing literacy and illiteracy rates in Nigeria. Source: Dataphyte. The claim that over 70% of Nigerians are illiterate is false. The most recent data from the Ministry of Education puts the estimated figure at 31%.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user, Itz Mc John Haruna, posted an image showing people standing and watching a fish that was claimed to be the worlds longest. The fish was said to have been found in a dam in Nigeria. Verdict: False! A check by DUBAWA revealed that the image in the viral claim is false. The image was AI-generated. A viral post on Facebook showing an image of a group of people gathered around what is purported to be the longest fish found in a Nigerian Dam is raising questions. The post has generated 81k likes, 17.6k comments, and 12k shares. Here are some of the reactions: Daniel Ifezue said, The longest fish indeed because youve assembled all the fishes in the world and measured them one by one to come to that conclusion. Cornelius Mereweather-Thompson said, I am surprised that the crowd doesnt descend on the fish and start cutting it to pieces. Do you think Nigerians would stand idly by to watch a gigantic fish? While the claimants post mentioned a dam, the attached image shows a drainage system. This immediately raises questions: Is this fish the longest-known species, or is it an exaggeration or misidentification? DUBAWA decided to examine the details of the image to determine the authenticity of the surrounding claims. Upon analysing the image, several key discrepancies emerged. First, while the poster claims the fish was found in a Nigerian dam, the photo reveals a drainage area, not a dam, significantly altering the storys context. The drainage appears partly dry, indicating that it is not a suitable habitat for such a large fish, further questioning the claims legitimacy. DUBAWA then ran a Google Reverse Image Search of the picture and discovered that it had been shared on other social media platforms, as seen here , here , and here . Additionally, we used a magnifier feature on Invid, a digital investigation tool, which revealed that the people standing around the fish in the image are not Nigerians, judging by the nature of their hair and skin colour. This raises further concerns about the authenticity of the scene. We also used Content at Scale , an advanced AI image detector, which showed that the image in question is AI-generated, with a rating of 97% AI and 2% human. DUBAWA further utilised another tool, Huggingface , which also gave a 98% AI and 2% human reading of the image, indicating that the image is unreal. The claim that the worlds longest fish has been found in a Nigerian dam is false! DUBAWAs investigations show that the characters and activities depicted in the viral Facebook image were AI-generated. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Nigeria Police Radio 99.1 Fm Abuja, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A user on Twitter claims that over 50 cows belonging to Fulani herdsmen were poisoned to death by Amotekun and or Yoruba youths in Akoko Local Government Area, of Ondo state. The claim that over 50 cows belonging to Fulani herdsmen were poisoned to death by Amotekun/Yoruba youths in Akoko LGA, Ondo state is false. The picture was dated from a news report that took place in 2019 and maliciously used to paint a false narrative. The ongoing crisis between Fulani herdsmen and farmers mostly in the south is no new story. Now, in reference to this existing reality, a Twitter user, Sarki (@Waspapping_) claims that over 50 cows that belonged to Fulani herdsmen were poisoned to death by Amototekun/Yoruba youths in Akoko LGA, Ondo State. The user implied that the matter is not voiced on any media. Alongside a photo displaying the acclaimed dead cows is also the narrative: I just woke up to the news that Over 50 cows that belong to Fulani herdsman were poisoned to deaths on Monday in Akoko LGA, Ondo state, by Amotekun/Yoruba youths, no any outcry from anyone or media outrage. No hashtags, nothing. Its well. Nonetheless, the tweet attracted over 1,100 like, close to 600 retweets and over 300 diverse comments that cut across suspicion and conviction. The acclaimed Amotekun displayed by the claimant is a security outfit based in southwestern Nigeria that was established in 2020 by the southwestern governors to respond to the security challenges in the region. Hence, this claim will not only trigger controversy but even chaos If it is not carefully scrutinized. DUBAWA conducted a Yandex reverse image search and results show that the acclaimed picture of dead cows in question was from major news in 2019 about a mysterious thunder that struck on Oke Owa, Ijare community in Ifedore Local Government Area of Ondo State, killing at least 36 cows. The news was popular around the time it occurred 3 years ago and had attracted multiple reports from different media. Apparently, the claimant only dated the picture a bogus narrative to it. The picture provided by the claimant as evidence was dated and picked out of its original context to paint a rather bogus and false report.",0
"Claim: Three images from Instablog9jas old post depict the perpetrators of a ritual killing. Verdict: Misleading! Our findings traced the images to three separate occurrences across Lagos, Uganda, and Ghana, suggesting that the narrative used to promote the assertion was fabricated for social media sensation. Three collaged images have been trending on social media, particularly on Facebook. Instablog9ja, a popular Nigerian blog, initially posted these images. The images depict a young man, a woman described as his mother, and a police van carrying a wrapped corpse. The duo was alleged to have conspired to rape, poison and eventually kill the mans younger sister for ritual purposes. He was caught during a stop-and-search operation carried out along Itamaga, Ikorodu Road in the state. During interrogation, he reportedly confessed to the Police that his mother, based on the native doctors instruction, asked him to k#ll his younger sister so that he could become rich, Instablog9ja claimed. Instablog9ja made this post on May 8, 2023, and Yabeleft Online republished the same narrative the next day. The popularity of these blogs made the claim go viral in the referred year. However, this claim began to recirculate in Oct 2024, as seen here , here , and here , with several users calling to prosecute the alleged suspects. DUBAWA decided to verify this verification due to the claims potential for misinformation. Image 1 DUBAWAs reverse image search traced this young mans image to an April 26, 2019, event. On that day, Bashiru Ahmed, a 21-year-old, was allegedly involved in a knife stabbing that led to the death of Oshin Aderibigbe, the Spokesperson of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS). Mr Aderibigbe, a recent graduate of the Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology, Lagos, was attacked in the Okoko area of Lagos State. Punch , Premium Times , and Daily Post reported this incident. Image 2 Again, DUBAWA found that the image of this woman did not originate from Nigeria but from a Ugandan murder case reported on Feb. 20, 2013. The woman, Rosemary Kamuli, 30, was arrested for killing her co-wife, Anna Basemera, in Kijenga village, Karago Town Council, Kabarole District, Uganda. According to the Uganda Radio Network (URN) , Ms Kamuli allegedly murdered Basemera after she visited their marital home to perform traditional rituals following the birth of twins with their shared husband. Image 3 Like the previous images, DUBAWA found that the third image is connected to a 2022 serial killing that took place in Wa town, Ghana. The wrapped corpse in the police truck was reportedly exhumed from a shallow grave in Bahamu, a suburb of Wa, on Sept. 19, 2022. According to Otec 102.9 FM , 18 people were arrested in connection with the incident, although eight were later released on bail. Our findings show none of these images described a rape, poisoning or ritual killing of anyone in Lagos, Nigeria. These images going viral are old and from an Instablog9jas 2023 post, which we found was fabricated to mislead the public.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user, Joe Igbokwe, alleged that Davido said he could not win a Grammy award because he failed to honour American rapper P. Diddys party invitation. Verdict: False. DUBAWAs findings show that the claim is untrue, as the Afrobeats superstar did not make such a statement. During the 66th Grammy Awards ceremony in Feb. 2024, Nigerian artiste David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, had his hopes dashed as he lost all three categories where his songs were nominated. On Oct. 5, 2024, a Facebook user, Joe Igbokwe , posted a picture of Davido with American rapper and record executive Sean Combs, known as P. Diddy. The user mentioned that Davido said he was not a winner at the Grammy Awards because he failed to honour P. Diddys party invitation. In the caption attached to the post, the Facebook user said that Davido made this statement while explaining why he could not win the famous Grammy. I turned down P Diddys party invitation twice and lost the Grammy twice despite arriving first at the award venue. My colleagues visited him, won the Grammy and became African giants, the claimant wrote. As of Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2024, the post had garnered about ten comments, 16 shares, and zero likes on the social media application. DUBAWA checks show that the post has been shared by multiple application users, as seen here , here , and here . While some people believed the claim to be accurate, others thought otherwise. A Facebook user, Atanda Quadri, wrote, I am proud of you, OBO. I appreciate those who achieve outstanding success in their careers, and you are one of them. Queen Onwugbalu said: He is talking rubbish. Another user, Nnaemeka Nwachukwu, queried, Did he say it? Due to the posts potential to cause harm, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim to set the record straight. DUBAWA noticed grammatical and spelling errors in the caption, which is unusual in Davidos write-ups. For instance, a proper noun in the sentence P. Diddy was not well capitalized, invitation was spelt as invitstion, and there are unnecessary spaces before punctuation marks. Furthermore, DUBAWA visited and combed Davidos social media accounts on X , Instagram , and Facebook but could not find any supporting information. We also conducted a keyword search on the claim to see if the claim was made at an event or interview but found no article by credible outlets. DUBAWA emailed Mr Davidos business email to get his comments on the claim, but he has not responded as of press time. Therefore, the claim that Mr Davido gave a reason he could not clinch the winning list at the Grammy Awards is false.",0
"Claim: Multiple Facebook pages, including Beautiful Life, Beyonce Lovers and Queen of Music, recently claimed that American singer Beyonc and American Rapper Jay-Z retired from the entertainment industry due to connections with embattled hip-hop mogul Sean Diddy Combs. Verdict: FALSE. Available reports reveal that Beyonc and Jay-Z have not retired from the entertainment industry and have not been linked to Diddys scandal. Sean Diddy Combs has recently been involved in multiple public scandals and legal issues, including allegations of sexual assault and criminal activity. According to the Associated Press, he is reportedly in custody following a federal indictment in New York , facing charges related to a series of alleged sexual crimes dating back to 2008. As these cases unfold, there have been rumours implicating other prominent figures, including Jay-Z and Beyonc. On Oct. 27, 2024, a Facebook page called Queen of Music shared a post titled, Diddy Breaks the Silence: Reveals the Shocking Scandal of Jay-Z and Beyonc and Their Secret Retirement. Similarly, on Nov. 10, 2024, a Beyonc Lovers page posted, From Superstar to Retirement Beyoncs Startling Revelation Shakes the Music Industry. Another page, Beautiful Life , claimed on Nov. 3, 2024, that Beyonc announced her retirement, with a post reading, Beyonc Announces Retirement After Private Video Leaks At Diddys White Breakfast Show Showing Disgusting Behaviour. As of Nov. 13, 2024, this post had attracted over 7,000 likes and 425 comments. The topicality of the issue and the personalities involved prompted DUBAWA to verify this claim. The Business Standard reports that Diddy and Jay-Z have a long-standing business relationship, which has led to speculation amidst the ongoing legal cases. Recently, Jay-Z and Beyoncs attorney, Alex Spiro, criticised broadcaster Piers Morgan for airing an interview with R&B singer Jaguar Wright, who drew comparisons between the couple and Diddy. Mr Spiro addressed these rumours, stating, Theres rumors, and then theres nonsense, and this is one step further. He indicated that they had issued an ultimatum demanding the removal of these false allegations or face legal action. According to the BBC , on Oct. 8, 2024, during an episode of Piers Morgan Uncensored, Piers Morgan offered an apology, saying, Editing interviews is not something we do lightly at a show called Uncensored. But like the proverbial cries of fire in a crowded theatre, there are legal limits on us, too. And we apologise to Jay-Z and Beyonc. We also consulted the DUBAWA Chatbot, asking if Jay Z and Beyonce were linked to Diddys scandal. The bot provided articles like the one by Vanguard and BBC , which showed the duo have not been implicated in any accusation linked to Diddys Scandal. We consulted the DUBAWA Chatbot on the retirement assertion, and it found no evidence to support this. According to the DUBAWA chatbot, no verified information indicates that Beyonc has quit music. In a September 2024 interview with GQ magazine, Beyonc discussed her approach to her music videos, confirming her continued involvement in the industry. She explained that while she distanced herself from the traditional pop star formula years ago, she remains dedicated to making music with meaningful messages. In February 2024 , Beyonc released two new singles, Texas Hold Em and 16 Carriages, which debuted during the Super Bowl. She then released her album Cowboy Carter on March 29, 2024. This album, a continuation of her previous work, Renaissance, features collaborations with artists such as Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus, Willie Nelson, and Linda Martell. Beyonc also mentioned that she has stopped producing music videos to allow her music to breathe on its own. Jay-Z, on the other hand, has remained active in music and business ventures since returning to the industry in 2006 despite announcing his retirement earlier. In a 2022 interview , Jay Z said, Im not actively making music, or making an album or have plans to make an album, but I never wanna say Im retired. Checks on the social media handles of Beyonces Instagram and Facebook pages show no news of such; likewise, a check on Jay-Zs Instagram and Facebook pages shows no such news has been shared on their handles. There is no post or news report on Jay Z or Beyonce retiring from the entertainment industry nor any evidence or report linking them to Diddys scandal.",0
"The Facebook account TVC News Nigeria is promoting a platform called Dangote investment. The accounts profile photo features the name and logo of Dangote Group , a company founded by Aliko Dangote . He is a well-known Nigerian businessperson, philanthropist and Africa's richest billionaire . In a post , dated 24 July 2023, the account says: DANGOTE INVESTMENT PLATFORM IS AN ONLINE TRADING PLATFORM THAT GIVES DOUBLE OF WHAT YOU INVESTED WITHIN 1HOUR AND 30MINUTES. The text is accompanied by a video of former Nigerian lawmaker Dino Melaye , calling on viewers to invest in the so-called Dangote investment platform. The post includes a WhatsApp link where interested users can send messages. We found similar posts here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Africa Check has exposed several Facebook accounts falsely claiming to offer investment opportunities to Nigerians. But is the investment platform and the page TVC News Nigeria legit? We checked. TVC News is a Nigerian broadcast station based in Lagos. The official Facebook page for the station is Tvcnewsng . It has a blue tick, meaning its verified by Meta , the company which owns Facebook. The page in question is named TVC News Nigeria . These names are very similar in an attempt to mislead Facebook users. The poorly written post is also a clue that the page is a scam. TVC News employs professional journalists and editors and one would expect all posts to be checked for errors before being published. The suspicious page has only 48 followers, while the official TVC page has over 345,000. The video in the post in question has only been viewed 160 times, a relatively low number. These are further red flags. Dangote Group manufactures different products, including cements, sugars and salts. In May, the company launched a refinery to boost the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. But Africa Check found no media reports of Dangote ever launching an investment platform. The group previously distanced itself from social media posts offering grants to Nigerians under the name Dangote Empowerment. In a 2021 tweet , the company said: Our attention has been drawn to a fraudulent scheme circulating on WhatsApp and social media titled 2021 Dangote Empowerment purporting to be sanctioned by the Aliko Dangote Foundation. This initiative is a scam! All signs point to these posts in the name Dangote investment also being scams. Africa Check has previously investigated similar false investment schemes here , here and here .

"The presidential candidate of the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP), Abiola Kolawole and his running mate, Zego Haruna, are on the town hall series by Daria Media Limited. The series, tagged The Candidates, provides a platform for the candidates to address national issues ahead of the February 25 , 2023, general election. The programme, anchored by Nigerian journalist, Kadaria Ahmed, is supported by the MacArthur Foundation, Nigerian Television Authority (NTA), and YouTube. DUBAWA, a member of the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition (NCF), will be involved in live fact-checking of claims made by the candidates. Claims made by the candidates and fact-check reports are presented below: Claim: Presidential candidate, Kola Abiola, claims the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) is the oldest party in Nigeria. The Peoples Redemption Party (PRP) was formed by Aminu Kano in 1978 after his withdrawal from the National Party of Nigeria. Created alongside four others, PRP is the oldest political party compared to the 17 other parties in Nigeria registered by INEC for the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Verdict: CORRECT Source: PRP website , The Guardian report Date: 22/11/2022 Claim: Kola Abiola, on Daria Media town hall, said Nigeria has an informal sector that is 60% of our economy. The most recent GDP report by the National Bureau of Statistics, which differentiated the formal and informal sectors, covered 2015. It puts the share of the informal sector at 41.43% . In 2017, the IMF estimated that the informal sector contributed 65% of Nigerias GDP. Verdict: False Source: National Bureau of Statistics, IMF Date: 22/11/2022",1
"Claim: The family of Justice Gloria Musu-Scott, in a recent statement, quotes the ruling party Chairman Mulbah Morlu as saying, their daughter Charloe Musu was killed for ritualistic purposes. Verdict: False. Online research on the particular Press Conference revealed that Morlu did not mention such a statement. The ruling party chairman also openly clarified the allegation to the media. The murder and armed robbery attacks on the home of Liberias former Chief Justice, Gloria Musu-Scott, have been greeted with several accusations, one of which is coming from the family of Justice Scott. Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was murdered on the morning of Thursday, February 23, 2023, at Justice Scotts residence in Brewville on the outskirt of the city. Other members of the household suffered injuries in the attack. It is not yet clear the motive for the murder and the attack but the news of the murder has since gone viral. The police have since begun an investigation into the matter. While citizens look forward to a speedy investigation and the arrest of the culprits, there have been some allegations and counter-allegations. One such is from the family of the former Chief Justice. On March 6, 2023, the family issued a statement accusing the ruling party chairman, Mulbah Morlu, of making statements against the family. The statement partly reads, On Thursday, March 2, 2023, the chairman of the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change CDC, Mulbah Morlu, had a Press Conference at the CDC headquarters in Sinkor. It was held immediately after the Liberian Women Sit-in Action in protest at the Legislature on Capitol Hill seat against the murder and assault against the Musu family. The family statement accused Mr Morlu of saying Charloe was killed for ritualistic purposes. The murder of Charloe has triggered widespread, vehement public condemnation in the country. The institutions and groups that have expressed disdain over the attacks include the Liberia National Bar Association , former Vice President and Standard bearer of the former ruling Unity Party, Joseph Nyuma Boakai . The gravity of the situation involving former Chief Justice Gloria Musu Scott and her daughters death and the accusation against the party chairman form the basis for this fact-check. Given the sensitive nature of the claim, DUBAWA decided to contact the family for evidence of its claim against the party chairman. But the family of the former Chief Justice, when contacted for a response, declined to verify the claim as indicated in their Press statement. The Family spokesperson Julius Musu in a telephone conversation with this researcher, said the family would not respond to the inquiry seeking answers over an allegation raised in their most recent release. All I can tell you is that the matter is before the police, and the family is cooperating, and that is all for now, Julius Musu said on the phone. The researcher scrutinised the video of March 2, 2023, press conference, which formed the basis of the ritual murder accusation attributed to Mr Morlu. From the scrutiny, it is clear there was no such accusation in the video. Though the family statement alleged that Chairman Morlu of President Weahs ruling Coalition said their daughter was used for ritual, he debunked the claim via telephone interview with OK FM on March 6, 2023 . His rebuttal, which can be heard between the 2:04:05sec on the show, among other things, rejected the claim, that is not true, I never said that. Several credible media institutions covered my press conference. The videos are out there. The claim by the former chief justice, Gloria Musu Scotts family, which accuses Mr Weahs three-party government chairman Mulbah Morlu of saying that Charloe Musu, daughter of Justice Scott, was killed for ritual purposes, is false. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with OK FM to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has announced plans to terminate its third-party fact-checking programme. This is a radical departure from the traditional content moderation strategy that began in 2016. The announcement , made by Mark Zuckerberg, the companys chief executive officer, via his verified Facebook page on Jan. 7, 2025, was among other policies to be implemented amidst what Meta termed as efforts to restore free expression and minimise errors within the platforms content policies. Zuckerberg in a video said Meta would incrementally phase out the third-party fact-checking programme. He said, Were going to get rid of fact-checkers and replace them with community notes similar to X (formerly Twitter), starting in the US. After Trump first got elected in 2016, the legacy media wrote non-stop about how misinformation was a threat to democracy. We tried in good faith to address those concerns without becoming the arbiters of truth. Since 2016, Metas fact-checking programme has collaborated with around 80 organisations globally to verify claims across its platforms, combatting the spread of misinformation, particularly during critical events such as elections and public health crises. Zuckerbergs announcement came amid growing criticism of Metas political bias in its fact-checking processes. He said that third-party fact-checkers have destroyed more trust than theyve created, particularly in the United States, and that the company is moving towards a model that emphasises user-generated content moderation. The transition to Community Notes means users will be empowered to provide context and insights on posts that may contain misleading information to boost community involvement in content moderation rather than relying solely on external fact-checkers. Zuckerberg noted that this change indicates a broader cultural shift towards prioritising free speech over stringent content controls. He said, [The 2024 United States presidential election] feels like a cultural tipping point towards once again prioritising speech. So were going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies, and restoring free expression on our platforms. Community Notes on X (formerly Twitter) began as a pilot programme on Jan. 28, 2021, but expanded to all users in the United States in October 2022 and globally two months later. Other platforms deploying user-generated content moderation strategies include Reddit and Wikipedia.",1

"The International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), a unit of the Poynter Institute, has invited fact-checking organisations globally to become signatories to its Code of Principles. Since its establishment in 2015, the fact-checking network has consolidated its position by uniting fact-checkers globally and supporting various initiatives such as annual conferences and training programmes. The Code of Principles is the standard for unbiased, transparent, and responsible fact-checking accepted by existing fact-checking organisations within the network. Organisations embracing these principles demonstrate a commitment to excellence in fact-checking, contributing to a global effort to combat misinformation. In return, they enjoy dividends and privileges exclusive to member signatories. This new development followed the temporary halt of membership to ensure thorough processing of those in the pipeline after the network received a record number of 61 new applications in 2023 alone. In the statement signed by the Deputy Director, Ferdi zsoy, on Jan. 23, 2024, the network revealed it provides new guidance and support to enhance the application process for organisations considering becoming signatories. Becoming an IFCN signatory signifies that a fact-checking organisation meets high editorial standards and has achieved financial stability, he said. However, start-ups or newly formed ventures cannot apply as membership indicates organisational maturity. The application process is scheduled to close on Feb. 20, 2024, at 11:59 PM (GMT-5), and the subsequent window opening would be on May 1, 2024, at the same time. Organisations interested in applying are encouraged to familiarise themselves with the IFCNs five core principles: nonpartisanship and fairness, transparency of sources, funding and organisation transparency, methodology transparency, and a commitment to an open and honest corrections policy. Eligible organisations must complete the New Applicant Eligibility Form and provide comprehensive information about their fact-checking practices, team, and funding sources. Submissions will be reviewed by IFCN staff, who will also guide organisations through subsequent steps.

"Claim: Social media users, particularly (Facebook) are accusing Montserrado County District #11 Representative Richard Nagbe Koon of holding an American passport contrary to the Liberia law. Verdict: DUBAWAs investigation, including the use of Pinterest , shows that the photo of the American passport, which has gone viral, was manipulated. Article 49 of the Liberian constitution states that The House of Representatives shall elect once every six years a Speaker who shall be the presiding officer of that body, a Deputy Speaker, and such other officers as shall ensure the proper functioning of the House. In fulfilment of this article, members of the House of Representatives went to the polls on Monday, Jan. 15, 2024, to elect their speaker and deputy speaker to head the House of Representatives and, by extension, the 55th legislature of Liberia. These elections set the basis for the inauguration of the president-elect and vice president-elect, Ambassador Joseph Boakai, and Senator Jeremiah Koung. During these elections, there were allegations that one of the two persons contesting for the speakership, Representative Richard Nagbe Koon of Montserrado County District #11, is an American citizen with an American passport. As seen here , Facebook was flooded with posts linking Representative Koon to being an American citizen carrying an American passport. According to the new Alien and Nationality law, A Liberian citizen who holds citizenship for another country shall not be eligible for any elective public office while still a citizen of another country. The legislature further stated in the repeal of the Aliens and Nationality Law that If such a person desires to contest, the person must renounce the citizenship of the other country at least one year before applying to the National Elections Commission (NEC) to contest with documentary evidence of such renunciation from the country and filed with a circuit court in Liberia. Here are excerpts from the new Alien and Nationality law of Liberia, as seen in the screenshot below. So, does Mr. Koon hold an American passport, which makes him a dual citizen? Due to the gravity of the claim, which borders on the constitution of Liberia, DUBAWA saw it necessary to investigate the passports authenticity. To begin with, our researcher first contacted the accused, Representative Richard Nagbe Koon, regarding the social media passport, which bears his name and photo. The researcher wanted to determine whether the passport was authentic and truly belongs to him. In response, Representative Koon said he was not an American citizen and did not hold an American Passport. The passport circulating on social media is fake. I travel to America using an info pass, and theres no way I would be a citizen of America and travel using an info pass. I have a green card that expired in 2018 in the teacher exchange programme at the University of Michigan, sponsored by the World Bank. Since it expired, I have been travelling with an Info pass, a stamp from the immigration office, he stated. Here are the screenshots of the interaction between Representative Koon and our researcher, Our researcher also emailed the United States embassy in Liberia through its public affairs section, but the embassy has yet to respond to the inquiry. We further ran a check on the passport trending on social media to ascertain the documents authenticity using Pinterest, and it was discovered that the document was manipulated. According to the search, the passport alleged to belong to representative Koon and the original from whence it was duplicated carry the same passport number and page number as seen in the pictures below. Based on all of the inquiries and investigations conducted by DUBAWA, it is evident that the copy of an American passport circulating on Facebook does not belong to Representative Koon. It was fabricated.",1
"Claim: Lateef Adedimeji bags a doctorate from an international university. Verdict: Indeed, Mr Adedimeji received an honorary doctorate from Estam University, Benin. Nevertheless, he did not fulfil the standard academic requirements as suggested by the claimant. The claim is misleading. In a recent Facebook post, Nollywood Picturestv , a notable entertainment blog, asserted that the acclaimed Nollywood actor Lateef Adedimeji has bagged a prestigious doctorate at an international university. The claim reads: Congratulations To Me, I Am Now a Certified PhD Graduate Popular Actor, Lateef Adedimeji Rejoice As He Bagged Doctorate Degree From An International University. The post has ignited a debate among Facebook users. While some extended congratulatory messages, others contend that Mr Adedimejis degree is honorary, stirring differing opinions. DUBAWA conducted this fact check to get the points right. We conducted a Google keyword search and discovered a DailyTrust article affirming that Mr Adedimeji was bestowed with an honorary Doctorate Degree from Estam University in Cotonou, Benin. Likewise, the recipient shared posts announcing this event on his verified Instagram and X handle. DUBAWA vetted his contents but did not find a place where he claimed to have fulfilled any academic prerequisites to merit this honour. In his words, he said: I have a new title, one I couldnt have imagined would come without me facing invigilators and keeping late nights to study The irony is really interesting. I burn midnight candles to master my lines and perfect my expressions. Now, Im getting rewarded with what could have been if I had done it for classroom reasons. I humbly reintroduce myself; I AM DR. ABDULLATEEF ADEDIMEJI ADETOLA, Doctor of Philosophy in Art and Culture from Estam University, Benin. Upon visiting Estam Universitys Instagram page, we found an official announcement describing Mr Adedimejis degree as an Honoris Causa Degree. Not only that, this institution also bestowed similar accolades upon notable individuals such as Nigerian actor Gabriel Afolayan, music promoter Abisoye Obayan, and Joyce Gagaoghene, Managing Director of Becktone Oil and Gas Limited. According to West Virginia University , honorary degrees are conferred honoris causa, a Latin term meaning for the sake of honour. Hence, by employing terms like bagged and PhD graduate in its Facebook post, Nollywood Picturestv exaggerated Mr Adedimejis doctorate. These expressions usually imply the fulfilment of conventional academic criteria rather than an honorary acknowledgement. Our findings indicated that while an honorary doctorate was awarded to Mr Adedimeji, he did not complete traditional academic requirements as inferred by the claimant. Hence, the claim is misleading.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user, George Udom, claimed that the #EndBadGovernanace protest has been shifted to October 1st with certain conditions. Verdict: False! One of the protest leaders, Omoyele Sowore, dismissed the claim as untrue. Meanwhile, no credible news outlet has reported the purported postponement. Ahead of a nationwide anti-bad government protest scheduled for Aug. 1, 2024, a Facebook user, George Udom , claims the protest has been postponed to Oct. 1, 2024. He stated that the Good Nigerian Movement (GNM) had announced the postponement, which is also based on the government meeting certain conditions demanded by the citizens. The conditions include temporary removal of import duties on food, affordable fuel availability, incentives, and security for farmers, among other social amenities. DUBAWA contacted Yele Sowore, one of the leaders of the nationwide protests, via WhatsApp and inquired if the claim was credible. In response, Mr Sowore informed us that the Facebook post is false and should be disregarded. Please ignore the desperate fake announcement in circulation that the #EndBadGovernance revolt has been postponed. It is false, he said. Moreover, no credible news outlet has reported any news of such postponement. Sources linked with the planned protest reveal that the claim is false.",0
"CLAIM : Over 300 drone cameras have been deployed by the US Embassy to expose police personnel likely to stop demonstrators from hitting the streets. False! No such drones have been installed, says the US Embassy official. A Facebook user by the name Abdulai Jalloh posted in a Facebook page/group named Friends Who Like Radio Democracy 98.1 FM , a picture of drones with a claim that the United States Embassy in Sierra Leone together with the Coastal Guard ship has mounted over 300 drone cameras in order to pick up or identify any police officer in the country who might stop any protester from coming out to stage a protest on the scheduled dates: 8, 9 & 10 August 2022. The Facebook post comes days after sections of the countrys youth announced a planned demonstration, strike or even to sit-at-home in protest over what they say is the rising cost of living in Sierra Leone. While it is true that some aggrieved youths are agitating for a street protest, it could not be said with certainty if the US Embassy had any role to play in the said demonstration. But, with the Facebook post fast becoming a subject of controversy, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim and to see if indeed the Embassy was playing any role in the protest. DUBAWA, the fact checking arm of the Centre for Journalism, Innovation and Development (CJID), sees it necessary to verify this claim because it has the tendency to destroy the relationship between Sierra Leone and the U. S. Embassy. Per the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the US Embassy cannot be meddling in the internal politics of any country, and Sierra Leone, is not an exception; so for a post to suggest that the US Embassy was deploying drones during an internal demonstration would be a flagrant violation of the said Convention, if it is found to be true. Also, DUBAWA considers it significant to verify the claim, owing to the fact that the page has over 27,000 followers/members; that in itself means that the claim is widely seen and read by lots of Sierra Leoneans at home and abroad. In order to verify the claim, DUBAWA first checked the website and social media handles of the US Embassy in Sierra Leone to see if there has been any official response by the Embassy to the claim. But there was none! Without seeing any such statement of denial, DUBAWA reached out to Alhassan Jalloh, who is the Press and Media Coordinator for the United States Embassy in Sierra Leone, via telephone interview to either affirm or deny the claim. Mr Jalloh dissociated the US Embassy from the drone publication on Facebook, saying This is fake. It is not on our Facebook page. He added that the US Embassy cannot be involved in internal political wrangling. DUBAWA asked Mr Jalloh if the Embassy was going to take any action, but his response was negative. We cant control this, he responded. DUBAWA has keenly followed the three-day demonstration announced by some sections of the countrys youth which has since turned violent with loss of lives and properties but has seen no sign of drone activities as the Facebook post had claimed. Claims about drone activities mounted by the US Embassys staff in Freetown, prior to the planned demonstrations (8, 9 & 10 August), are false. Checks by DUBAWA before, during, and even after the demonstrations indicate there were no signs of drone activities in the country. Also, the Press and Media Coordinator for the United States Embassy, Alhassan Jalloh, vehemently denied any such claim, stating that the Embassy would not engage in any such unfortunate activity to censor the activities of the Sierra Leone Police (SLP).",0
"By: Cole Praise and Lademi Aborisade Metas Third Party Fact-checking Program has been credited as the global funder for Fact-checking organisations. This was contained in the 2022 State of the Fact-checkers report by theInternational Fact-checking Network (IFCN). The report, which reflected an upward shift in the budget of fact-checking organisations worldwide, revealed that Metas third-party fact-checking program retains its position in 2021 as the highest funder. According to the 2022 report, Metas Third Party Fact-Checking program remains ahead of other funding sources for fact-checking platforms worldwide. It has so far not been overtaken because the program turns over 45.2% of its total income towards financing fact-checking organisations. Metas Third Party Fact-Checking program is still the leading funding source for fact-checking organisations, contributing 45.2% of their total income, the report reads. Metas funding is informed about how misinformation is a recurring problem and its interest in partnering with independent fact-checking platforms to mitigate its spread on social media. Meta, through original reporting, depends on fact-checkers to review the authenticity of stories posted on its social media app. The program has created the largest global fact-checking network and contributed over $100 million to programs that facilitate its fact-checking interests. In 2020, Meta partnered with fact-checking platforms to tackle COVID-19 mis- and disinformation peddled during the period. Together with IFCN, it floated a $1 million emergency grant program to that cause. Metas report on its investment in Fact-checking revealed it launched a health fellowship program with ten fact-checking organisations that will allow them to expand and combat health misinformation. The organisations operate in countries across Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East. In addition to combating health information, Meta partnered with global technology nonprofit Digital Health Lab at Meedan to fight online misinformation. In collaboration with the firm, several virtual training sessions were held between its medical staff and Metas third-party fact-checking partners. Other IFCN-partnership programs that Meta has funded include Climate Misinformation Grant, Global Fact-checking Mentorship Program , and Fact-Checking Innovation Initiative . Meta also funded a year-long fact-checking fellowship with the National Association of Black Journalists , creating an avenue for fact-checking platforms to hire potential journalists. It also floated an Accelerator Challenge program that pooled various fact-checking organisations to share ideas and create new strategies to enable people to access the right information. During election periods, Meta, formerly Facebook , has always thrown its weight behind fact-checking organisations worldwide to propagate truth and debunk false information.",1
"Claim: Information Minister, Lai Mohammed, has claimed that soldiers who attacked unarmed protesters used blank ammunition, and blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone False. Blank ammunition if not used properly can kill. Studies and reports have confirmed several such deaths. The attack of unarmed protesters by unidentified soldiers at the Lekki Toll gate in Lagos has generated several comments globally, in which authorities in Nigeria have denied directing soldiers to attack unarmed citizens. The military first denied knowledge of attacking protesters but later said it only fired blank bullets. Recently, the CNN investigation which supports other investigations done by prominent media organizations on Lekki shooting such as Premium Times , Peoples Gazette , Arise News among others, sprout out negative and positive comments from citizens including the government. The Minister of Information and culture, Lai Mohammed in a nationwide Press briefing claims soldiers at the Lekki toll gate fired blank bullet into the air, and blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone, adding that firing live ammunition into the crowd, as some have alleged, would have led to mass killing, which never happened. Dubawa did a google search which returned several articles on the subject. In April 1993, The NewYork Times reported that Brando Lee, a 27 years actor, the son of a popular actor, Bruce Lee died on the scene when he was shot by a gun with a blank bullet. Mr. Lee was shot 20 feet away in his abdomen when he was filming the movie titled, The Crow. Also publications by Metalfloss on December 4, 2015 reveals in the year 1984 that an actor Jon Erik-Hexum died while on the set of CBSs Cover-Up as a result of a blank cartridge. Bored by incessant delays, the actor pointed a gun loaded with blanks to his head and reportedly said, Can you believe this crap? before pulling the trigger, the report added. He had pressed the barrel directly to his temple , and the force of the explosion still did incredible damage, even without a bullet. It drove a small chunk of his own skull into his brain, which caused severe hemorrhaging and put him in a coma. He died as a result of his injuries. Make no mistake: blanks can kill, the publication warned. Another publication in Forensic Science International Journal said the necks of three persons were badly injured as a result of loaded blank ammunition. The weapon is said to have either been loaded by blank cartridges or tear gas cartridges which each victim died from blood loss as a result of ruptured cervical vessels.. Dubawa also reached out to a retired colonel Chinedu Owhonda for comments. Owhonda said blank ammunition can injure and kill someone, depending on the range it was shot from: Blank ammunition can injure somebody, and can kill, it also depends on the impact. If you fire someone at close range to the chest, definitely the person will have issues, he said. Evidence gathered indicates that blank bullets can injure and kill someone. This makes False Lai Mohammeds claim that blank ammunition cannot do any damage to the flesh, not to talk of killing anyone.

"Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo has put up his hotel in Morocco as a shelter for the survivors of the earthquake, according to a number of social media posts. One 10 September 2023 post reads : Despite being mocked by Morocco after loosing the worldcup, Ronaldo offered his hotel to the people affected by the earthquake in morocco. The Portuguese football team was knocked out of the 2022 Fifa World Cup tournament by Morocco in the quarterfinals. Moroccan fans trolled the Portuguese captain , saying he failed to secure a win for his team and country. A 6.8-magnitude earthquake hit Morocco on 8 September 2023, killing more than 2,500 people and affecting over 2.8 million others. The Pestana CR7 hotel owned by Ronaldo in the city of Marrakech was not affected by the disaster. The claim has also been posted here , here , here , here , here , here and here , and was covered by news platforms Punch and Daily Trust . But has Ronaldos hotel hosted earthquake survivors? We checked. The hotel management has denied the claim, despite media reports about it. The management told the media that they had received many requests to host people because the hotel was not affected by the earthquake. It is not accurate to say that we are hosting refugees and victims,"" a representative of the hotel said. Sport news site Goal quotes the hotels spokesperson who labels the claim false information. A fact-check report by Reuters also debunked the claim.",0
"Claim: According to a post by Shine Liberia , a social media blog, the legally elected Speakers office has finally received the Draft National Budget from the Chief Clerks Office. Verdict: False. The Executive has rejected this claim, asserting that the draft budget has yet to be re-submitted. The government maintains that its Nov. 18, 2024, submission to the acting Chief Clerk remains valid. Furthermore, Shine Liberia has failed to authenticate its assertion. The fight for legitimacy in Liberias House of Representatives has escalated amid claims over who is in charge of the 2025 Draft National Budget. The controversy follows the majority blocs move to oust Speaker Fonati Koffa. In October, members of the House signed a resolution calling for Speaker Koffas removal, citing alleged actions they deemed counterproductive to his office. The political upheaval coincided with the submission of the national budget by the Executive branch, creating uncertainty over which faction in the House would receive the document. Amid this turmoil, on Tuesday, Dec. 3, 2025, Shine Liberia claimed via social media that the legally elected Speakers office had finally received the Draft National Budget from the Chief Clerks Office. Way to go congratulations, Shine Liberia posted, adding, 73 copies were submitted by the Ministry of Finance to be distributed among the 73 Representatives. The post featured images of Speaker Koffa and the budget documents but raised more questions than answers. Other outlets, including DTV Online , amplified Shine Liberias claim. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the current House of Representatives stalemate this week. DUBAWA sought to verify Shine Liberias assertion in light of public interest. Research reveals that the draft 2025 budget was submitted to the acting Chief Clerk on Nov 18, 2024, who forwarded the document to the majority bloc supporting Speaker Koffas removal. Contrary to Shine Liberias claim, the Ministry of Information clarified that the Executive had not re-submitted the draft budget. A government statement emphasised that the November 18 submission remains valid and was never withdrawn. Jerolinmek Piah, the official government spokesperson, dismissed the social media post as baseless. Not true, he said when asked about the claim. Based on the evidence, Shine Liberias post and similar reports are demonstrably false.",1
"Several Facebook pages have been created, apparently to help Nigerians with their investments. Posts on the pages claim to offer investment plans to Nigerians to double their money within an hour. The account, BBC News Nigeria, uses the name and logo of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). One 29 May 2023 post reads : ""Choose a platform to grow and earn financially. NORLAND is one of the best platform that's ever secured and fast in trading and its an easy withdrawal program. ""Invest In NORLAND INVESTMENT and get paid within an hour ,we are 100percent legit,real and trustworthy......Stop letting the fear of losing be greater than the excitement of winning."" The post then lists the investment structure, including a student category, appear to show that the investment will double almost immediately. It includes a video and WhatsApp link where those who are interested are encouraged to send a message. The video has been viewed by more than 40,000 users. The account has posted similar messages and videos here , here , here and here . But is this a scheme of BBC News Nigeria and is the investment platform real? We checked. The badly written posts raised our suspicions, as the BBC is a well-regarded news organisation staffed by professional journalists and editors. We also noticed that the page was relatively new, with its oldest content published on 29 May. We also saw the number of followers on the account was low, no more than 50, compared to the BBCs following in Nigeria. The BBC desk covering Africa is known as BBC News Africa . The original Facebook page of the broadcaster in Africa is BBC News Africa . The Africa arm supports four Nigeria languages: BBC Pidgin , BBC Hausa , BBC Igbo and BBC Yoruba . They are all verified by Facebook with the BBC News Africa page alone having over 8 million followers. Another smoking gun is that a Nigerian journalist was scammed by the same investment platform in April 2023. The journalist lost N90,000 (about $US193) to the scheme, according to his account reported by the Lagos-based Foundation for Investigative Journalism . Africa Check has debunked a similar Facebook account claiming to offer investment to Nigerians.

"Claim: A certain web-based message that the Federal Government has approved Individual NIN registration online to avoid the unnecessary crowd in NIMC centers. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is now carrying out registration online via a certain link is false. The website is found to be fraudulent and untrustworthy, mostly used to boost page views by redirecting users fraudulently. The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) operates and regulates matters of national identity in Nigeria with services covering National Identification Number (NIN) enrolment and issuance, National e-ID card issuance, identity verification as well as data harmonization and authentication. While NIN is The National Identification Number (NIN) is a set of numbers assigned to individuals in Nigeria to identify them as bonafide citizens. Since the government announced the compulsory linkage of NIN numbers to mobile SIM cards, NIN registration centers have been witnessing a massive turnout of people who are yet to register. It is perhaps because of this preponderant situation in NIMC registration centers that a certain web-based message that the Federal Government has approved Individual NIN registration online to avoid the unnecessary crowd in NIMC centers. The web-based message provides a for users to click and commence the registration process. After clicking the provided , the user is redirected to a page that requests phone number, which subsequently, a new page is shown with three steps that demand completion before the acclaimed completion of the NIMC registration. These steps include: copying a provided , sharing it on multiple WhatsApp groups for a provided limit before proceeding to the registration proper. Previously, DUBAWA has carried analysis on multiple claims that relate to NIMC, NIN registration which all turned out to be false. It is as a result of these realities that this link is subjected to scrutiny to confirm its reliability. DUBAWA first took notice of the apparent spelling blunder obvious in the web-based message that claims to offer NIMC registration to Nigerians. Government was wrongly spelled as Gorvernment and unnecessary was also misspelled as unnecesary. Furthermore, an analysis of the website on ScamDoc (a web tool that evaluates digital identities reliability {email address or website} and provides answers to questions frequently asked by Internet users such as: How to check if a website is reliable or not? How to detect fraudulent emails?) reveals that the domain name is very recent (less than 6 months) with a short life expectancy that is linked to one or more countries known for being used by fraudulent websites similar to websites DUBAWA analysed in the past. Results of the analysis from ScamDoc Furthermore, the website was also discovered to be malvertizing (a word that blends malware and advertising, to refer to techniques cybercriminals use to target people covertly) by demanding users to share the link to groups on WhatsApp. Malvertizing is carried out by buying ad space on trustworthy websites and, although the ads may appear legitimate (as the one under scrutiny), there is a malicious code hidden inside them that redirects users to fraudulent websites or installs malware on their computers or mobile devices that keeps bringing up notifications. In this case, the user is redirected to this website that talks about religious dogmas not in any way related to NIMC registration. Even though DUBAWA has contacted NIMC several times and yet to register a response, the news regarding NIN registration conducted online would have been reported widely by the media. However, no reports indicate that the NIMC registration is now carried out online. The information circulating on WhatsApp that the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is now carrying out NIN registration online via a certain link is false. The website is found to be fraudulent and untrustworthy and is mostly used to boost page views by redirecting users fraudulently.",0
"A twitter user, Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari budgeted N3.2 billion for food and travel for 2020. He also claimed that President Buhari increased the fuel price three times in 2020. He further claimed that the President inherited an exchange rate of $1 to N199, the rate has risen to $1 to N500 now. False. The budgets for the presidents food and travel amounted to N2.65 billion and not N3.2 billion. It is also false that the president had increased the pump price of fuel three times as at December 9, 2020 when the claim was made. Checks showed that in 2020, fuel pump price was increased four times contrary to Omokris claim that it was increased three times. Moreso, President Buhari inherited an exchange rate of $1 to N197 and as at when the claim was made, $1 was exchanged for N380 officially. Omokri , with about 876,000 followers, made a number of claims on President Buharis budgets for food and travels, fuel price hike and naira-dollar exchange rates. He tweeted : General #Buhari has a N3.2 billion food and travel budget for 2020. That is N8.7 million daily. He is living lavishly at our expense, but increased fuel price 3 times in 2020. He met dollars at $1 to N199. Now it is $1 to N500. How true are these claims? The 2020 budget of the Presidency obtained from the Budget Office of the Federation showed that a total of N2.65 billion was budgeted for the Presidents food and travel expenses. A look at the document showed that N2.53 billion was budgeted for his travel and transport, comprising N1.75 billion for international travel and transport and N775.60 million for local travel and transport. In terms of the presidents food, N98.31 million was budgeted for his food stuff/catering materials supplies while refreshment and meals amounted to N25.65 million. In all, his food and travel budgets amounted to N2.65 billion, contrary to the claimed N3.2 billion. Secondly, data sourced from the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA), showed that the pump price of fuel has been on a downward slide from January 2020 up to June 2020 when the agency fixed the price between N121.50 and N123.50 per litre from the N123.50 per litre it announced for May. The first price increase was in July when PPPRA raised the pump price of fuel to between N140.80 and N143.80 per litre. The second price increase was in August, 2020 when PPPRA fixed the pump price between N148 and N150 per litre. Then, the third price increase came in September, 2020 when PPPRA fixed the price between N158.18 and N162 per litre. Additionally, PPPRA announced the fourth increase in pump price of fuel in November, 2020 ranging between N168 to N170 per litre before announcing a N5 cut in the price in December, 2020. Therefore, in 2020, fuel pump price was increased four times, contrary to Omakris claim that it was increased three times. Finally, on the exchange rate claim , the record of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) showed that on May 28, 2015, $1 exchanged for N197. That was a day before President Buhari was sworn in to office on May 29, 2015. However, CBNs record showed that as at December 9, 2020, the official exchange rate was N380 per dollar. Though parallel market exchange rates are historically higher than the official rate, official records do not support Omokris claims. The claims are false. The budgets for the presidents food and travel amounted to N2.65 billion and not N3.2 billion. It is also false that the president had increased the pump price of fuel three times as at December 9, 2020 when the claim was made. Checks showed that in 2020, fuel pump price was increased four times contrary to Omakris claim that it was increased three times. Moreso, President Buhari inherited an exchange rate of $1 to N197 and as when the claim was made, $1 was exchanged for N380 officially.

"Jaundice is a common and usually harmless condition in newborn babies that causes yellowing of the skin and the whites (sclera) of the eyes. Newborns with jaundice, medically called neonatal jaundice , are easily identified with yellowing of the palms of the hands and/ or soles of the feet, yellow urine instead of being colourless; pale-coloured pooh instead of being yellow or orange. These symptoms, among some others, usually develop between 2 to 3 days after birth and tend to get better without treatment by the time the baby is about 2 weeks old. In fact, about half of all newborns develop mild jaundice in the first few days. In premature babies, jaundice may start early and last longer than in full-term babies. But if bilirubin levels become extremely high, complications such as brain damage (kernicterus), cerebral palsy, and deafness can occur. Little wonder parents, especially mothers, seek for all means to prevent or cure their babies of this medical condition, not giving a second thought to what the side effects of any of the preventive or curative measures taken can be. But, is it really true that unripe pawpaw water does the cure? From time immemorial, there has been the assumption and belief that there are natural remedies to jaundice, one of such being that unripe pawpaw water cures neonatal jaundice fast. For instance, a recent post on a Facebook account claims that unripe pawpaw water is efficient in curing neonatal jaundice. Also, a popular Nigerian blog, legit.ng , while highlighting benefits of unripe pawpaw fruit, water and seeds, noted that one of the advantages of unripe pawpaw water includes the cure for jaundice. The Facebook message posted on Sunday, August 2, 2020: A Consultant Neonatologist at the University College Hospital (UCH), University of Ibadan, Dr Olukemi Tongo, said the claim of such a cure is false. There are lots of myths out there about green pawpaw water, pawpaw leaves and all thatthose things are not treatments for jaundice in babies. It will delay the baby receiving correct treatment; you may even be giving the child contaminated water in the name of givingthis traditional medicine and all that. She explained that neonatal jaundice requires appropriate treatment by qualified doctors, as such medical experts would know what level the jaundice is in the neonate and also approve the right treatment for such. Furthermore, in a published interview by The Eagle Online in 2018, a Consultant Pediatrician with Holy Family Pediatric Hospital, Osogbo in Osun State, Dr Kayode Valentine, also sounded the same warning that using unripe pawpaw water is not an antidote to jaundice. He noted that if jaundice was not well treated, it could cause death of the baby or make the baby handicapped due to brain damage from excess bilirubin that entered the babys brain. Moreover, a Nigerian Journal on Clinical published April 6, 2013, noted that there was also the misconception that water extract from paw-paw was used as treatment of neonatal jaundice and that neonatal jaundice is a common disorder worldwide and one of the important contributors to the high neonatal morbidity and mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa. There are several reasons why this claim appears dangerous, according to Dr. Tongo. They include the following: According to Dr Valentine, there is also the danger of losing the child to the cold hands of death. Both medical experts established the fact that administering unauthorized medications could cause brain damage or death of the child, hence, the need to often embrace medical treatments from qualified medical experts. Medical experts do not agree with the claim that unripe pawpaw water can cure jaundice. Also, experts warn against ingesting newborn babies with pawpaw water, as such action has adverse effects on the newborn organs, kidneys and livers are not yet mature to handle these substances . Hence, the claim that the soaking or boiling of unripe pawpaw water cures jaundice is unproven.

"Claim: When the Unity Party was exiting in 2017, inflation was 30%, said Randall Dobayou, a stalwart of the CDC and Deputy Director for the Environmental Protection Agency. Verdict: False. Inflation did not hit 30% in 2017, as asserted by the speaker. Data from the World Bank, IMF and others suggest 12.44%. The debate surrounding the best platform to transform the country has taken centre stage on major radio platforms across Liberia as the crucial October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections draw closer. One such argument among Liberian politicians is the issue of how the economy has been managed so far and how the winner of the upcoming elections can consolidate the gains made. A stalwart of the ruling establishment and deputy director for the Environmental Protection Service, Randall Dobayou , said one of the track records of the Weah administration had been macro-economic stability. We all saw in this country the Unity Party exit. The inflation was at 30%. Today, according to the IMF and World Bank report, inflation is 7%. So for the economy, we have already taken giant steps, said Dobayou as he argues Weahs governments priority on the OK Conversation show with two other opposition members. He made these statements during the show on Monday, May 29, 2023, just around 46 min s of the program. The claimant responded directly to a question about the governments major concerns and how unique the CDC ticket is compared to others. Due to the weight of the claim and its biting effects on citizens, DUBAWA has seen the need to fact-check the statement. Inflation is a term that we use to describe rising prices. It also reflects the annual percentage change in the cost of goods and services. The consumer price index usually measures it. Before Weahs election in 2017, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Havard-trained economist, presided over the countrys leadership. According to world bank data, inflation in 2017 stood at 12.4%. Also, the International Monetary Fund data for Liberias inflation indicate that in 2017 the inflation rate was 12.4% . Other data sources like Statista , macrotrends have on their separate websites 12.44% and 12.42 as Liberias inflation rate for the year 2017. However, Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberias current inflation is 6.9 or 7% . Findings show that the assertion that Liberias inflation was 30% in 2017 is false.",0

"The COVID-19 pandemic brought about new hygiene practices, some of which were unsafe. An example is washing fruits and vegetables with detergents, which was debunked in 2020 by the Times of India . Recently, a TikTok video of a lady explaining why she washes her groundnut before eating was shared on Instagram by Instablog with the caption, Lady reveals how she makes her groundnut hygienic for consumption. According to this lady, she takes the time to wash her groundnuts with detergent before eating them because of her experience with a groundnut seller. This video, as of Friday, Jan. 26, 2024, had 733,848 plays on Instagram, triggering different reactions with 4,911 comments and 5,175 shares. In the comment section, an Instagram user @Datedogeh08 wrote, Soap cant clean out completely, so shes killing herself by taking chemicals from the groundnut. Another user, @Jancyskin, queried why she didnt use salt and urged her to stop misleading people. Why didnt you use salt instead? Stop misleading people, Abeg. The question is whether this practice is hygienic, safe, or dangerous. Seeing the reach and engagement this video attracted, DUBAWA thought to clarify the facts and health issues around this. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fruits and vegetables should be cleaned under running water, whether you want to eat or cut them immediately. The centre warns against washing fruits and vegetables with soap, detergent, commercial produce wash, bleach solutions, or other disinfecting products. The United States Department of Agriculture also warns against soaps and detergents for cleaning food items. A 2021 report by the Washingto n Post noted that washing vegetables and fruits with soap or detergent harms the fruit and those consuming it. This is because the produce may absorb the soap, or the consumer may not end up rinsing off all the residue. An article by Mpasho , which highlighted that detergents often contain chemicals, fragrances, and other additives that are not intended for ingestion, noted that using soap or detergent on food items affects the taste, texture, and overall quality of the dish. Jason Bolton, an extension professor and food safety specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, speaking with the Washington Post, said, Soap, in many cases, has a different chemistry from what the body should ingest. Soap can irritate your gastrointestinal system, leading to vomiting or diarrhoea. It could even interfere with friendly microbes in your gut. While advocates of washing food items with detergents like the lady claim it helps to clean and disinfect them, Ben Chapman, a professor and food safety extension specialist at North Carolina State University quoted by the Washinton Post, said cool running water could remove 90 to 99 per cent of unwanted pathogens on our produce. According to Healthline s guide for cleaning vegetables and fruits, cool tap water is sufficient for cleaning. This guide noted that fresh produce should not be washed and kept but washed right before use. In its guide to raw peanuts, Hampton Farms noted that running these nuts under warm water two or three times and patting them dry is enough to clean them. While some food items like nuts and vegetables must be cleaned before use, experts noted that running them through cold or warm water is enough to clean such items. The use of detergents is harmful to both the food item and the consumer.",1
"Claim: Pre-marked ballot papers were identified at Williams V. S. Tubman High School within district #8 with precinct code 30348. A news media outlet, Today Liberia TV, made this claim. Verdict: Misleading! Pre-marked ballot papers were not discovered at Williams V. S. Tubman High School in District #8 with precinct code 30348. A media outlet, Today Liberia TV , posted on its official Facebook page pictures suggesting that pre-marked ballot papers have been identified at one of the Polling Precincts in District #8 Montserrado County. The platform claimed that the incident happened at the William VS Tubman High School with precinct Code 30348. To verify this claim, our fact-checker visited the exact polling precinct and interviewed poll watchers from both the main opposition Unity Party (UP) and the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), who, in separate remarks, denied anything of such taking place at their precinct. Augustine Yengbeh, the poll watcher of the Unity Party, said, No pre-marked ballot papers were discovered here today. I have been here since the start of the entire process until now. I have not heard or seen anything of such. His comments were backed by his counterpart from the ruling CDC, who didnt disclose his name. However, there is another school within the vicinity, A. Glen Elementary School, with precinct code 30349, that had such a situation. According to the observers of the Unity Party, James Teah, they discovered pre-marked ballot papers during the process, but it was removed from the rest of the papers and destroyed.",0
"The Facebook page Grant Opportunities Today claims that the Nigerian government is giving out monthly grants of N100,000 to all Nigerians. One of the pages posts , dated 21 July 2024, invites interested users to Submit Application Today and provides a link where they can supposedly apply for the grant. The post has received over 1,100 comments and over 46 shares. The pages posts have been republished here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.)

According to the website, Application Ends 7, August 2024, 11:59 PM. It also featured a CLICK HERE TO APPLY button. We clicked on the button and it took us to a site about United States visa sponsorship. There is no mention of the N100,000 grants. This is an example of engagement bait . These social media posts ask for likes, comments or shares to increase reach without offering a reward. They can drive traffic to a website, potentially generating advertising revenue.

"Claim: Reno Omokri, a social media influencer and critic, claimed that the Lagos state governor renovated the Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos. Verdict: False! Findings show that the federal government renovated the Third Mainland Bridge. The Third Mainland Bridge is the longest of three bridges connecting Lagos Island to the mainland. The others are the Eko and Carter bridges. The 11.8-kilometre bridge links the commercial district of Lagos Island to the mainland section of the city and once held the title of the longest bridge in Africa until 1996, when the 6th October Bridge in Cairo was completed. An important part of Lagos infrastructure and a central traffic corridor, the bridge helps reduce traffic congestion on the other fly over and improves transportation from the citys port. Over the years, the famous bridge has undergone several renovations to maintain its functionality due to heavy traffic, including in 2012, 2020, 2021, and most recently between November 2023 and April 2024, after a six-month closure. On May 26, 2024, President Bola Tinubu of the Federal Government was in Lagos to commission the bridge. While the second phase of the renovations is ongoing, i.e., May 2024, several conversations have been had about the source of its funding, and debates have been held about state governments and how well they have used their increased FAAC monthly allocations. Popular social media influencer Reno Omokri on April 25, 2024, while highlighting some of the achievements of Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo Olu, claimed that the governor renovated the Third Mainland Bridge. A part of the posts caption reads: Go to Lagos. Sanwaolu increased salaries for Lagos civil servants. Built railways all around the state. Renovated the Third Mainland Bridge Further referencing this statement that the governor had been putting the increased revenue to use and making comparisons to other governors, he wrote: Again, what is your Governor doing with his increased allocation when his wage bill has not increased? Could it be that he is resting on his oars and enjoying the increased allocation with his cronies simply because your disappointment with the #NigerianElections2023 has made you fixated on Tinubu, and you expect the President to do to you what your Governor ought to be doing? As of May 25, 2024, the post had been viewed over 296,000 times, generating over 2,000 likes, 540 retweets, and 485 comments on X. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed excitement and disbelief. An X user, @bummiearo , wrote: Thank you for always saying the truth, while @baresi2010 wrote, Sanwo-Olu renovated the third mainland bridge and is about to start building the fourth mainland bridge? I laugh in Itsekiri language. Another user, @CorneticusT wrote, Exactly my bro. What are they doing with the money? Having observed the various reactions generated by the post, DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. The Federal Government of Nigeria, not the Lagos State government under Governor Sanwo-Olu, undertook the renovation of the Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos. While the Minister of Works, Dave Umahi, was Flagging off the N21 billion repair project in Lagos in November 2023, he said, This is yet another milestone in the actualisation of the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Bola Tinubu. Speaking at the same event, Deputy Governor of Lagos, Obafemi Hamzat, thanked President Bola Tinubu for giving attention to the maintenance of Third Mainland Bridge and others in the state: So we are flagging this off and many other roads in Lagos that will be affected based on the appropriation that Mr President signed already that will be coming to Lagos and other parts of the country, so again we thank you Other credible media reports on the bridges rehabilitation also credit the Federal government for the renovation. Clearing any doubt about the project amidst speculations in April, the Minister of Works stressed that the Federal Government wholly funded the rehabilitation of the 11.8-kilometre Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos in April. The Lagos State Government did not do the Third Mainland Bridge. No, it was done by the Federal Government as directed by President Ahmed Tinubu. The Federal Government bore everything about the funding through the Ministry of Works, the minister said. Also speaking during the opening in May 2023, the Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Seun Osiyemi said , Of course, this is an infrastructure that has been given to us by the federal government so its ours, and we need to embrace and keep it, because a lot of money has been spent on this and its actually going to ease a lot of our transport. Our findings show that while the Lagos State government might have been involved in the planning stages, public pronouncements indicate the federal government was primarily responsible for the financing.

"The Federal Government through NEF has organized FREE LAPTOP SCHEME, reads a post on Facebook. It was posted by the account National Empowerment Fund - NEF on 8 May 2023 and includes a link where users are told to register for the free laptops. In the comment section to the post the account has written that the laptops will be delivered to beneficiaries. It has attracted over 1,200 likes and more than 60 comments. But is the NEF and this offer to be trusted? We checked. Africa Check looked up this supposed government fund and found no mention of it online and in any credible media outlets. We found a similar initiative called the Nigeria Youth Investment Fund (NYIF) by Nigerias federal government. It describes itself as dedicated to supporting the creative ideas, skills and talents of young people to help them become entrepreneurs. Using a fake name is common practice when the aim is to scam people. We looked more closely at the link in the post. We followed the link and landed on a Google form asking for personal information. Google form is a free survey administration software powered by search engine Google. The form asked for details such as full name, date of birth, phone number, and home and email addresses. This is sensitive information that could put users in danger of cyber or physical attacks. One of the other red flags is that the page has just over 45 followers on Facebook . This would be significantly higher if it were indeed a government initiative. For example, N-Power , a Nigerian government initiative aimed at tackling unemployment among young people, has over 650,000 followers on Facebook. Another red flag is that the page in question is new. Its page transparency section shows that it was created on 4 April 2023. It has had little activity since then. Trying to be safe on Facebook?

"On Tuesday, Jan 7, 2025, Metas CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the companys decision to terminate its third-party fact-checking programme, starting in the United States. Before this discontinuation , Meta had been using the services of independent fact-checking organisations to moderate content on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. Under this project, Meta partnered with fact-checking organisations like DUBAWA to identify potentially untrue information across its platforms, conduct fact-checks, and report such content. This made it easier for Meta to flag misleading or false posts. Meta announced that it would replace fact-checkers with a community notes system after discontinuing the project. In place of traditional fact-checkers, this new approach would allow users to provide context under posts that may contain false or misleading narratives. That is then used to flag what content is true or false. While community notes are not a strange feature to X users, they may be new to some users of Metas products. Here are six key questions that will help you understand this tool better, along with some relatable explanations. 1. What is the purpose of community notes? According to X, Reddit, and Wikipedia, which have already adopted this user-generated content moderation model, the purpose of community notes is to fight misinformation. On X, this tool lets users add clarifying notes to tweets that might be misleading or incorrect. Imagine you see a tweet claiming your favourite celebrity did something outrageous without any proof. With community notes, someone can step in and provide the facts or context needed to set the record straight. This way, everyone gets access to better information and can make more informed decisions. However, despite the use of community notes on X, misleading or false information is still shared on a daily basis. 2. Who can contribute to community notes? Whether its a casual user or an expert on a topic, Notes lets anyone add their voice to a conversation. In other words, if you spot a post that seems off, you can write a note to help clarify things. Think of it as being in a group project where everyone pitches in their knowledge to improve the final product. This open participation encourages different viewpoints and makes discussions richer and more informative. Apart from being trained professionals, fact-checkers often interview experts and deploy technological tools when verifying information. The downside of community notes is that users with little to no knowledge about a subject matter are also allowed to determine what information the public considers true or false. 3. How are contributions currently evaluated? One way platforms like X attempt to manage community notes is by allowing other users to upvote or downvote notes based on how useful they think they are. If you find a note helpful, you can give it an upvote. If it doesnt add much value, you can as well downvote it. This system helps highlight the best contributions so that when youre scrolling through tweets, you can easily spot the most reliable information. Whether this evaluation method is effective or not might be another question to ask. 4. How do users access Notes? On X, once a note gets enough votes from the community, it becomes visible right below the original tweet. This means if you see something questionable pop up in your feed, you can quickly check for any notes that clarify or correct it. 5. What are the benefits of Notes? According to its developers, community notes goal is to foster a sense of involvement and trust among users and enhance critical thinking skills. However, apart from being a political move, Zuckerberg sees the adoption of community notes as a way to ensure more freedom of speech. 6. Does community notes have any limitations? Several individuals have argued that community notes has several limitations that affect its effectiveness in addressing misinformation. According to Alex Mahadevan, the MediaWise Director at the Poynter Institute, one major issue is that around 60 per cent of the most-rated notes never become public, meaning many crucial clarifications go unseen. Additionally, for a note to be displayed, it must achieve consensus across the political spectrum, which is challenging in todays polarised environment. This often leaves important notes unpublished. The delay in publishing notes also hinders timely responses to misinformation, limiting the overall impact of the feature.",0
"Claim: Some Facebook posts have a claim that Nigerian public universities are set to resume on 15th March. There is a possibility that ASUU resumes after its four-week warning strike. However, the union has not announced its plan to resume on the 15th of March as claimed by social media users. Rather, the union still maintains its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement position. The claim is, therefore, false. As conversations between the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and Federal Government of Nigeria continue, a breaking news which has a claim that varsities are to resume on 15th March, has been circulating on social media. Aside the need to revitalise public universities, the 2009 agreement between the union and Nigerian government has been a major source of incessant industrial actions, disrupting the education of students in Nigerian public universities. In order to demand the fulfillment of this agreement, ASUU again embarked on its fresh three-week warning strike on 14th of February, 2022. Particularly on Facebook , DUBAWAs finding reveals a breaking news started circulating on Wednesday, 9th of March, 2022. Screenshots of similar posts have been repeatedly forwarded by WhatsApp users in different versions. While stirring controversial comments , some Facebook users have questioned the source of this claim. Despite that, a large number of people believed it to be true. For example, Ismail Abubakar demanded for the source of this claim from one of the posters. Plz stop playing with our emotions , he added to his comment which never got any response. Another user accused a poster of confusing people. He further urged other users to wait for an official announcement. He said: U guyx are saying what u dont knowledge, this not good delete this post, u are confusing people, wait for the anouncement first. Over time, DUBAWA has observed that during significant situations in the country, individuals and blogs dont stop sharing information. Despite that many fail to name their sources, many continue to misinform the public. Going by such an event, has ASUU declared its resumption plan? Information such as this usually makes it to the headlines of national dailies. But on the contrary, DUBAWA could not find any similar news in prominent Nigerian newspapers. News with such anticipated prominence with no actual appearance in any daily signifies a red flag. Furthermore, after careful observations, DUBAWA discovered that the circulating information was written in the same format except with little changes, in a few cases. But while some of them were written with assertions that varsities are resuming, others used the expression expected to resume in their publications. But one thing was common with these different versions, their headlines carry the breaking news or NEW tag. Meanwhile, in a March 7th publication of Premium Times newspaper, ASUU still maintained its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement stance. The union has already assured that it would continue the industrial action until whatever the government wants to do with the agreement is completed and an acceptable implementation commences. This came from the leadership of the union after the minister of education, Adamu Adamu, gave a three-month deadline to the newly inaugurated committee members who are to renegotiate the ASUU-FG 2009 agreement. This further refutes ASUUs resumption plan as claimed. ASUU has not announced its plan to resume on the 15th of March as claimed by social media users. Rather, the union still maintains its no resumption until implementation of 2009 Agreement position.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user has alleged that soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo is married to American YouTuber Darren Jason Watkins, popularly called IShowSpeed. Verdict: FALSE. DUBAWAs checks have shown that the Facebook users claim is false. Also, the images shared depicting the said marriage were generated by artificial intelligence. In June 2023, videos of American YouTuber and rapper Darren Jason Watkins, popularly called IShowSpeed and Christiano Ronaldo, went viral on social media. Ishowspeed, a big fan of Ronaldo, showed excitement after seeing his football superstar for the first time. In the video, Speed showed the soccer star a tattoo of himself as a top fan on his left arm. A year later, a Facebook user posted images of Ronaldo and Speed, claiming the YouTuber was pregnant for the Al Nassr forward. Penaldo and Speed after marriage, the Facebook user claimed on May 29, 2024. Data available on Facebook showed the post had over 9,200 comments, 4,700 shares, and 152,000 likes as of June 28, 2024. A Facebook user, Ikem Uju , who commented on the post, wrote: We will all see the end of it all. Now, it looks perfect, but time will tell. Every perversion from nature has great consequences. We are enjoying technology today, yet the same technology is destroying the world gradually. Another Facebook user, Jackson On Fir , wrote: This baby will grow so stressed, frustrated, and confused when he knows this terrible history; the right family is composed of woman+man = children, not man+man nor woman+woman, neither. Also, Delores Pearson commented on the post: No matter what people do, they cant undo what God did. If a man says hes pregnant, guess what he was born she!!!! Also, see online posts about the purported marriage between the soccer star and the YouTuber here , here , here , and here . DUBAWA decided to probe the claim due to its virality and the interest it has generated online. IShowSpeed has disputed the rumour. Reacting to it, the rapper questioned why people would fall for such a lie without evidence. What is wrong with yall? I wish it was true, but it is not. You cant play like this. Stop telling me congratulations, IShowSpeed said in a YouTube video , starting from minutes 2:15 to 2:42. The Al Nassr forward has been dating the Argentine-born Spanish media influencer Georgina Rodriguez since 2016, when the two met at a Gucci retail store in Madrid. Rodriguez has two children with Ronaldo and acts as a stepmother to his three other children. There is no evidence to support the claim that the Portuguese forward is in a sexual relationship with the YouTuber. After an extensive search across various online platforms, DUBAWA could not locate any images or publications of Ronaldo and Speeds marriage on reputable websites. DUBAWA later scrutinised the photos using an AI image detector, Hive Moderation , which revealed that the image was 99.5% AI-generated. The claim that Ishowspeed is pregnant after his marriage to Cristiano Ronaldo is false. DUBAWAs findings have shown the photos were AI-generated.

"Claim: An older woman and other family members were arrested by South African Police after a Nigerian son-in-law paid R95000 lobola (bride price) with fake money. Verdict: False! The image attached to the story was taken from a 2021 post by the South African Police Service. Also, the Police Service issued a statement debunking the false information. In recent years, there has been a growing misconception about Nigerians in the international landscape. In some quarters, it is believed that Nigerians are involved in fraud in one way or another, although no fact supports such perception. This is not unconnected with the countrys perceived corruption profile and some cases of past Nigerians arrested for fraud-related activities. Due to this, claims supporting this narrative make the rounds on social media. Recall that in Sept 2023, an X user tweeted that the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom found that 700 Nigerian Nurses had fake qualifications as other people stood in for them at the examination centre. He further asserted that Nigeria is considered a red list country for the recruitment of health professionals, meaning poaching of staff could endanger its own health and care system. A lot of netizens believed the report to be accurate, as this was reflected in their comments. However, an investigation by Reuters showed that the claim was false. DUBAWA observed a trail of false information about Nigerians circulating the social media space at the time. Some users share unverified assertions or manipulate existing reports to taint the image of Nigerians, particularly one that portrays them as fraudsters. On Jan 27, a popular blog tweeted that an older woman from Jukulyn, Pretoria, in South Africa and some family members had been arrested after being caught with counterfeit currency. It was alleged that their Nigerian son-in-law, Kelechi Adegoke Johnson, had paid R95 000 in cash to the family as lobola (a South African word for bride price). However, the money was fake, and the family innocently circulated it. The blog claimed the woman had taken part of the money to purchase items at ShopRite when apprehended. DUBAWA observed that people believed the report as reflected in their comments. One user, @ Dilika_ asked, What good do Nigerians contribute to South Africa? Some other users whose comments showed their belief in the report could be seen here , here and here . The report was also shared on Facebook , as seen here . Due to the sensitivity of the post, DUBAWA fact-checked it. DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search on the image attached to the Jan 27 tweet and observed it was taken from a 2021 post by the South African Police Service. At the time, the police statement explained that it arrested four suspects with R2 million counterfeit money. According to the statement, two women aged 57 and 58 and two men aged 36 and 48 were arrested and would be charged in court two days after the press release. The release did not state whether the suspects were relatives, nor did it mention the payment of a Nigerian son-in-law. Digging further, DUBAWA observed that the police force had recently issued a statement debunking the false information. The Police service said its members did not arrest any elderly woman at a store in Jukulyn, adding that no such case was registered at Rietgat (Jukulyn) and the neighbouring police stations. The service decried irresponsible social media use by users who deliberately post misinformation and others who reshare without verifying. The sharing of misinformation puts the South African Police Service at a disadvantage because all the allegations of crime have to be investigated. This leads to the Police utilising State resources and losing valuable time that could have been better utilised to investigate real incidents. Eventually, that also disadvantages victims of crime and hampers service delivery, police explained. The assertion that South African Police arrested an elderly woman and other family members after their Nigerian son-in-law paid R95000 lobola (bride price) with fake money is false.",0
"Claim: An Instagram user @ callmedangofficial claims that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sent a female astronaut to space for six days with 100 tampons and asked if that would be sufficient. Verdict: NASA queried Sally Ride, the first American female astronaut, about the adequacy of 100 tampons for a six-day mission. However, there is insufficient evidence to prove whether she received any tampons. A humorous video posted by an Instagram user @ callmedangofficial on June 21, 2024, has sparked a discussion on Instagram about the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) preparation for astronauts. The comic clip highlights the space agencys decision to provide a female astronaut with 100 tampons for a six-day mission. The video, which has over 23,000 likes, states, Remember when NASA sent a woman to space for only six days and they gave her 100 tampons. 100 tampons. And they asked, Will that be enough? Because they didnt know if that was enough, Belsky sang at her keyboard. These are our nations greatest minds. They are literally rocket scientists. The poster credited Marcia Belsky as the speaker in the video. Some of the comments on the post include @thesuccess_lana who pointed out the logic behind NASAs move, Its better to have them and not need them, because what if something happens and she stays longer than six days? Meanwhile, @Iambored858 offered a witty perspective, Maybe they didnt know because theyre men. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search of NASA and 100 tampons. While the search results show multiple platforms that have shared this claim, they also surfaced a story about Sally Ride, the first US woman to be in space. In 1983, 32-year-old Sally Ride made history as the first American female astronaut in space, thus breaking gender barriers on the NASA STS-7 mission. She worked the robotic arm to help release satellites into space. According to Rides 2002 oral history interview , NASA engineers asked if 100 tampons would be sufficient for her one-week flight. Ride recalled suggesting that half that number would be more appropriate. I remember the engineers trying to decide how many tampons should fly on a one-week flight. They asked, Is 100 the right number? Ride recalled. According to the transcript , she replied, No, that would not be the right number. They said, Well, we want to be safe, continued Ride. I said, Well, you can cut that in half with no problem at all. The tampon tale is not the only example of NASAs initial gender-related misunderstandings. Ride also recalled that engineers assumed women astronauts would want makeup in space, leading to the design of a makeup kit. Ride said in a January 2018 tweet shared by the NASA History Office, The engineers at NASA, in their infinite wisdom, decided that women astronauts would want makeup so they designed a makeup kit. However, a lesser-known aspect of her journey has resurfaced, highlighting the agencys early misconceptions about women in space. Through the keyword search, DUBAWA discovered that the conversation was revived in 2020 in a viral song by comedian Marcia Belsky , which @callmedangofficial recreated as a comic video on June 21, 2024. DUBAWA also found that it was posted on TikTok during the 2024 International Womens Day with over 2,300 reposts and about 200 comments. Users like Fryegirl commented, This will always be the best example of what women face on a daily basis when men try to make decisions for us. Liam Brunet expressed disbelief, they gave a woman astronaut an exorbitant amount of self-care supplies due to not knowing how space would affect her stuff SHAME ON THEM SHAMEEEEEEE. According to Sally Rides interview, NASA engineers asked if 100 tampons would be sufficient for a six-day mission, but it remains unclear if they provided her with that many tampons, as the claim was also recreated from an old video.

"Claim: Nigeria had the highest inflation rate under Obasanjo-Atiku, not under Buhari. Verdict: FALSE.The highest inflation rate occurred in 1995, while former president Olusegun Obasanjos two-term tenure commenced in 1999 and ended in 2007. The official spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC)s Presidential Campaign Council, Festus Keyamo, has lashed out at the presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar, and his party, the People Democratic Party (PDP), declaring that the highest inflation rate in the history of the country was recorded during the latters administration as vice-president to former president Olusegun Obasanjo. Mr Keyamo made the assertion in an i nterview with the news channel, AriseTV on Monday, January 16, 2023. He was also reported by Vanguard newspaper to have said that the inflation rate witnessed under the Buhari-led administration isnt the highest in the countrys history. This is not the highest inflation rate. In 2005, under Obasanjo and Atiku, we had a 28 per cent inflation rate. Under Obasanjo and Atiku, we had the highest, he was quote d as saying by the newspaper. This is happening in the aftermath of a series of p olitical jibes between both parties, who have been at loggerheads since the realisation of each others strength on the political scene. Due to the sensitivity of the matter, and the underlying critical perception it could have even on the upcoming 2023 elections, DUBAWA decided to look into it. The former president, Olusegun Obasanjo and Atiku Abubakar, his vice president, ruled Nigeria between 1999 and 2 007. Within their two terms, it was in 2001 that the economy experienced an ascending inflation rate of 18.87%, with an 11.94% annual rate increase. Presently, the countrys inflation rate at the end of December 2022 is 21.34, dropping a little and terminating a 17-year rate increase of the previous month. An inquiry into macro trends ga ve the analytical list of the inflation rates in Nigeria since her independence in 1960. A closer study of the statistical information revealed that since Nigeria became a sovereign state, the country witnessed the highest inflation rate in 1995, at a critical mark of 72.84%, with an annual increase rate of 15.80% in the previous year. Also, WorldData info presents a corresponding report about inflation rates in Nigeria, in comparison with the United States and Europe. In the report, 1995 is also recorded as having the highest inflation rate, 72.84%, and the only one in the countrys history. Mr Keyamos assertion is wrong. In the history of inflation rates in Nigeria, 1995 witnessed the highest rate of inflation, which was four years before former president Olusegun Obasanjo took over power as president of Nigeria.",1
"A post on Facebook claims to offer investment opportunities for Nigerians in a networking program for the less privileges under the name Rolvi Trading. The 30 June 2023 post reads , in part: It's an investment platform were you get (2x)-two times of what you invest, We're just using it to assist the citizens of the country's for the betterment of life and future, It's a newly launched in nigeria and it's really paying. The post is published by an account called Opera New Nigeria which uses the logo of Opera News , a mobile news application that allows users to follow trending news topics. The post includes a video of a man promoting Crowd1, a scam Africa Check has debunked . The video has been viewed more than 1,400 times. Some of the comments to the post ask for more information.

Similar posts here and here repeat almost identical messages. Africa Check has exposed several Facebook accounts falsely claiming to offer investment opportunities to Nigerians. And Crowd1 has been debunked by both Africa Check and fellow fact-checking organisation Dubawa . But is this scheme by the page Opera New Nigeria real? The page is named Opera New Nigeria, but the platform is known as Opera News with its Nigerian branch Opera News Nigeria . This is an indication that the page posting about Rolvi Trading and Crowd 1 is not genuine. The suspicious account has only one follower and was created on 30 June. By comparison, what appears to be the official Opera News Nigeria account is followed by over 140,000 people and was set up in January 2019. Rolvi Trading is a real company specialising in trading across a variety of markets. The Facebook link found on the companys website did not link to an actual account, but we could click through to the company's Twitter and Whatsapp handles. We reached out to Rolvi Trading and the company said it had nothing to do with the Facebook posts. It told potential investors to disregard them.

"Claim: A news headline outlines that JUST IN: Buhari Shot Dead By Gunmen In Edo The headline is misleading. The Buhari in question was not the president but a driver with Hart land Construction Company. Headlines are crucial in telling a news story. Misleading headlines and sometimes half-truth carved captions have misinformed and even misdirect peoples sense of reality. Even notably, a recent headline reads, JUST IN: Buhari shot dead by gunmen in Edo . It was first shared on PM NEWS and reappeared on ther platforms carrying the same headline. As expected, the headline drew serious attention from the public who thought the story was referenced to the President, Muhammadu Buhari. On Facebook, the post attracted multiple comments. A user, Nasiru Mohammed, wrote, God forbid, death at your door but not our president. Several other users questioned, which of the Buhari? Another user, James Kamar remarked that Oh my God, this is a bad way for the president to die. May his soul rest in peace. While the headline did amass traction, the narrative was nothing more than a usual news story. The Buhari in question was a driver with Hartland Construction Company. Simply identified as Buhari, he was reported to have been shot dead in Benin, the Edo state capital, by Unknown gunmen believed to be kidnappers. According to PMNews, two police operatives on guard duty were also shot at by the gunmen, before kidnapping an expatriate worker. Although the event took place, the presidents name in the headline gave the story rather unusual attention. While some users took time to read the actual narrative others took it as it was; the president is dead!!! Headlines tell what a story is about. Nonetheless, in this case, the headline is rather misleading as the Buhari in question is not the President but a driver.",0
"Claim : Several news websites including ThewillNigeria , Naijadiary reported that Desmond Elliot called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria following the #EndSARS protest. The claim that Desmond Elliot called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria as a result of the #EndSARS protest is misleading. The headline to the reports doesnt match the content as there was nowhere in Mr. Elliots speech where he categorically said social media should be regulated in Nigeria. The aftermath of the #EndSARS protest came with an influx of controversies, multiple streams of information, and claims. One of these is a speech by Nigerian actor and politician, Desmond Elliot. Mr Elliot, who is representing the Surulere constituency at the Lagos House of Assembly, was a Nollywood actor who later joined politics as a state lawmaker. At the Lagos State House of Assembly on Wednesday, 26th October 2020, the lawmaker pushed for his fellow lawmakers to pay more attention to the social media. He was reacting to activities of social media users and other citizens following some downside of the #EndSARS protests. Tagged business of the day, the lawmakers were discussing the effects and aftermath of #EndSARS protest in Lagos; destruction of monuments, public and private properties. Mr. Elliots speech centred around activities of social media influencers and other users was met with rife criticism by Nigerians who rebuked him for referring to users as children and calling for regulation. Some sections of the media reported Mr. Elliots speech in this sense. For instance, thewillnigeria.com , a news website, claimed Demond Elliot, called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria in line with the impact it had on the #EndSARS protest. The claim was presented in a news report that was headlined Regulate Social Media- Desmond Eliot alongside transcribed statements from Mr. Desmonds speech. Picture 1: Headline of the story on ThewillNigeria Naijadiary came up with a similar headline with the lead, A video captured the moment Nollywood actor turned politician, Desmond Elliot , called for social media regulation at the Lagos State House of Assembly. Nigerian social media also processed and reacted to the speech in a like manner. Alex Weenick (@Alexweenick ) tweeted in reaction, Dear Desmond Elliot, If you want to shut down social media like China, Also suggest that death penalty should be included for corrupt politicians like China is doing. #EndOppression #Endbadgovernance #EndSARS Another user @Oluchristy implied that the lawmaker even said. There Will Be No Nigeria In Five Years If We Dont Stop Social Media ~ Desmond Elliot. Like the news headlines, tweets, comments and other posts on social media perceived Mr Elliots speech as a call for the regulation of social media in Nigeria. Dubawa sets out to find out if Mr. Elliot actually made this call. DUBAWA traced the original video clip that captures the plenary session of the Lagos Assembly. A content analysis of Mr. Desmonds speech during the plenary session revealed that he mentioned social media twice in his 6 minutes speech. First when he said that We need to address certain things: Nigerian youth; the social media; the social influencers. All of these are making the narrative that were seeing today. Except were joking with ourselves, social media , yes though good has its negative impacts. And when he also said, Please celebrities; please social media influencers, stop the hatred already. You have a means constitutionally to change the government; its called your PVC. DUBUWA could not trace anywhere within the speech where Mr. Elliot said something about social media regulation in Nigeria . Furthermore, thewillnigeria.com , seems to have doctored Mr. Desmonds speech to suit its headline: Regulate Social Media- Desmond Elliot. In one instance, keywords from his statements were excluded in the reports. Picture 2: Screenshot of thewillnigeria.com reports on Mr. Desmond Although the highlighted statement is quoted as Mr. Desmonds words, his actual statement transcribed from the audio is different. The actual statement from Mr. Desmonds speech, contrary to the highlights in red, as poised by thewillingnigeria.com was Except were joking with ourselves, social media , yes though good has its negative impacts. while ThewillNigeria quoted him as saying Except were joking with ourselves, social media, has it s negative impacts. omitting the phrase yes though good. In his widely referenced speech, Mr. Desmond never categorically called for regulation of social media in Nigeria. The reports and concurring social media comments are misleading.",0
"With its immense popularity among the global youth, TikTok has evolved from a hub for dance routines and lip-syncing videos to a significant source of information. Interestingly, even media outlets have embraced the platform to engage younger audiences through creative content. However, TikToks accessibility and reach have also made it a target for misinformation, with malicious actors luring unsuspecting users through manipulated videos and sensational headlines. Research reports published in 2022 and 2024 revealed that the platforms algorithm had sometimes recommended misleading content to users. Below are a few instances from 2024 where TikTok became entangled in the web of misinformation. A TikTok user shared a video claiming that United States President Joe Biden had made a statement about the Dangote Refinery. According to the video, Mr Biden allegedly urged Aliko Dangote to set petrol pump prices in Nigeria at N150 to alleviate the economic burden on citizens. However, a fact-check by DUBAWA revealed that the video had been manipulated. Furthermore, such a significant remark from a prominent figure like Mr Biden would have been reported by credible news outlets, yet no such report existed, further confirming the claims falsehood. Read more . In August, the #EndBadGovernance protests swept across several cities in Nigeria. Four days into the demonstrations, videos surfaced on social media, showing Nigerians in the northern part of the country carrying Russian flags. An investigation by DUBAWA uncovered that a TikTok influencer with over 100,000 followers was behind the spread of this false information. The influencer used misleading hashtags such as #Zangazanga (a Hausa word for protest), #Putin, and #Rusiya (a Hausa word for Russia) to call for Russias intervention, further fueling the misinformation. Read the investigative piece here . In April 2024, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported that scientists from Ocean Networks Canada (ONC) had predicted a potential eruption after detecting about 200 small earthquakes per hour beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, far off Vancouver Island. Following this, a video on TikTok showed collapsed towers and trembling buildings, allegedly linked to the earthquake in Canada. However, a fact-check by DUBAWA revealed that the clips used in the video were unrelated and had been taken from various past events, either in Canada or other countries, debunking the claims authenticity. See more information here . In 2023, Emdee Tiamiyu, a Nigerian YouTuber, gave an interview to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), during which he made controversial claims that reportedly impacted Nigerian immigrants in the United Kingdom. Earlier this year, a claim circulated on social media alleging that Mr Tiamiyu had been arrested and deported to Nigeria due to his involvement in criminal activities. While the specifics of the alleged crime were unclear, a Liberian YouTuber claimed that Mr Tiamiyu had been arrested by the UK government for defrauding 160,000 in asylum support to build a house in Ogun state. However, DUBAWAs investigation found the claim to be misleading. The picture of the house shared as evidence was sourced from an entirely different context, further discrediting the narrative. Read more here . In 2024, one instance of misinformation on TikTok involved a user, @Be_wise0, sharing what appeared to be screenshots of reports from the popular Nigerian news website, Punch, on the Biafra agitation. The headlines in the screenshots read: Reps ask Nnamdi Kanu to drop Biafra agitation, but join politics for Igbo president and Presidency speaks on Biafra: We cant give out South-South; if the 5 South-Eastern states want to go, they are free. These posts gained traction, drawing attention from users, some of whom supported the claims. However, our findings revealed that the screenshots were manipulated versions of an original Punch report, altering the headlines to create false narratives about Biafra agitation.

"Claim: TikToker Abdulai Bangura17 shared a tweet on TikTok stating that the Political Parties Regulation Commission (PPRC) has stopped the All People Congress Party (APC) from holding campaign rallies. Verdict: FALSE. PPRCs Director of Training and External Relations, Lucian Momoh, confirms that the PPRC has not stopped or banned any political party from holding rallies. Instead, it has provided a campaign timetable for all parties to prevent supporters from clashing. Sierra Leoneans are geared up for the countrys presidential election scheduled for June 24, 2023. In the heat of the campaign by the political actors, a TikToker, abdulaibangura17, has shared a tweet from Twitter to TikTok that states that Sierra Leones Political Parties Registration Commission ( PPRC ) stakeholder Abdulai Bangura has stopped the political rally of the All Peoples Congress Party ( APC ) while allowing the Sierra Leone Peoples Party ( SLPP ) to conduct its campaign. The initial claim on Twitter has since been deleted, but screenshots continue to appear on social media platforms like here on TikTok. Given the probability of this post spreading misinformation and creating animosity among members of opposing parties in the campaign, DUBAWA found it necessary to investigate the claim. The researcher first checked with the ECS L to ascertain the campaigns situation in relation to the law. DUBAWA found a release published by the ECSL detailing the elections campaign period for Presidential, Parliamentary, and Local Council elections, which kicked off on 23 May 2023. The campaign calendar dictates the days each political party should go on a rally and at which district they should do so. The full campaign calendar from the ECSL can be downloaded here . The researcher also located a preliminary report from PPRC on election campaign monitoring. The report indicates the PPRCs satisfaction with the campaign conduct of all the political parties that have had their rallies from May 23 to June 1. The researcher additionally interviewed the Director of Training and External Relations, Lucian Momoh, who said: The PPRC chairman has never and would never halt any political party from campaigning. Moreover, the researcher located several posts on Facebook of APC supporters who rallied on one of the dates (June 2) ECSL mapped out for APC campaign rallies. It can be found here and here . The claim holds no truth, as the PPRC did not stop any political party from holding its campaign rallies.",0
"Claim: According to a viral WhatsApp message, the COVID-19 vaccine shortens your life span and leads to impotency This claim is false and misleading as Dubawa could not find anywhere the professor made this claim. Also, the WHO, several studies and reports do not agree with this claim. As vaccine rollout continues, we have seen an increasing spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation, including claims that the vaccine has been weaponised to depopulate the world . Recently, a viral WhatsApp message claims that the vaccine reduces the lifespan of as many that took the vaccine. For people below 50 years of age, they are expected to die within 5-10 years while those above 70 will die within 2-3 years. The message which was attributed to one professor Dolores Cahill also claims the vaccine makes people impotent. anyone who got the vaccine will be dead within 5-10 years time. If you are over 70years old and got the vaccine, -you will be dead within 2-3 years time. But most importantly you become impotent first. Excerpt of the WhatsApp message. Dubawa researched the professor and also conducted a keyword search on the claim. Doctor Dolores Cahill up until March 18, 2021, was a University College Dublin (UCD) professor , who chaired the Eurosceptic Irish Freedom Party, before her resignation on March 22, 2021. Her incessant online claims around COVID-19 led to a request for her to resign from a leading European Unions scientific committee and her removal from her lecturing role. DUBAWAs keyword search did not yield any useful result as we could not find the WhatsApp claim anywhere online outside WhatsApp. We, however, saw other claims made by the professor. Dr Cahill who was the Professor of Translational Science at the UCD School of Medicine has been one of the leading advocates against lockdown and mask-wearing during the Covid-19 pandemic. She once said that children who wore face masks were being starved of oxygen and would have lower IQ. She also claimed that Lockdown and social distancing are not needed to stop the spread of the virus, as people who recover are immune for life after 10 days. She also said death and illnesses can be prevented by extra vitamins like vitamins C, D and zinc. Opposing vaccinations, she also said politicians and the media are using COVID-19 as a fear-mongering propaganda tool to try and take away rights from people to make them sicker and to force vaccinations on them. These claims have, however, been fact-checked by the journal which showed they are false and misleading. The European Commission in response to these claims said her claims could cause significant harm if taken literally. Her former institution UCD has also disassociated itself from her comments. DUBAWA reached out to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which noted that Dr Cahills claim is false, as available COVID-19 vaccines have been assessed for safety and have also been found not to interfere with the human Deoxyribonucleic (DNA). There is no evidence of this. COVID-19 vaccines, including mRNA vaccines, save lives and prevent serious illness from COVID-19. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccine technology has been rigorously assessed for safety, and clinical trials have shown that mRNA vaccines provide a long-lasting immune response. mRNA vaccine technology has been studied for several decades, including in the contexts of Zika, rabies, and influenza vaccines. mRNA vaccines are not live virus vaccines and do not interfere with human DNA. Excerpt of WHOs comment. The claim that the COVID-19 vaccine makes one impotent is false as the possibility of impotency has been discussed only in association with the virus, not the vaccine. A 2020 study has suggested COVID-19 survivors might develop sexual and reproductive health issues; however, the study noted that evidence from diagnostic procedures, such as penile color-doppler ultrasound and hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis evaluation is necessary to assess the extent to which COVID-19 has been able to impair erectile, and finally vascular, function. Relatedly, vaccination and adhering to recommended COVID-19 guidelines have been advised to avoid any possible side effect associated with COVID-19. Also, DUBAWA s explainer throws more light on the COVID-19 vaccine and fertility issues for both men and women. This article shows fertility of men and women is not affected by COVID-19 vaccines. While studies on the virus continue, the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that none of the vaccines rolled out so far has been found to make men or women infertile. The claim attributed to Professor Cahill is false and misleading as Dubawa could not find anywhere the professor made this claim. In addition, the WHO, and other studies and reports do not agree with this claim. Even if the claim was made by the professor, her reputation with propagating a number of strongly rejected claims about COVID-19 questions her credibility and makes COVID-19 information from her not trustworthy.",0
"The production of pure water (sachet water) has been b.nned in Lagos State, reads the caption of a video circulating on Facebook in Nigeria since November 2024. The video shows some men wearing orange jackets destroying packs of sachet water. Some Facebook users believe the men acted on the states order. Sachet water, also known as pure water , is a common and affordable source of drinking water in Nigeria. It is sold in small and sealed plastic bags. In January , the Lagos state government banned the use of styrofoam and single-use plastics, with the ban on styrofoam taking effect in February to reduce plastic pollution. The same claim can be found here , here , here and here . But has the Lagos state government banned the production of sachet water? We checked. No plan to ban sachet water On 1 December, Lagos state commissioner for the environment and water resources , Tokunbo Wahab, responded to the claim and said that the government had no plans to ban sachet water in the state. He said this in a statement posted on his X account: It is important to emphasize that Lagos State has not banned sachet water and does not have plans to do so. Wahab said the individuals seen in the video were officers of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (Nafdac). But Nafdac denied any involvement in the matter. This wasn't the first time the state had denied the claim. On 15 October , the director of climate change at the environment ministry, Bankole Omoniyi , told the media that sachet water was not banned in the state. The claim that sachet water has been banned in Nigerias Lagos state is false.",0

"CLAIM: Jackie Chan and his daughter cry while viewing his old movies. VERDICT: Misleading! The video depicts a scene from the 2023 film Ride On, featuring Jackie Chan as the lead actor. In this scene, Chans character is a stuntman, and Liu Haocun portrays his estranged daughter. They are seen together in the video, sobbing while watching a compilation of Chans past movies. An Instagram account, Clips , recently shared a video online that showcases a touching and emotional moment involving veteran actor and martial artist Jackie Chan and his biological daughter. The video describes the scene as a heartwarming experience that captures the nostalgic expression on Jackie Chans face as he watches footage of the challenging stunts he has performed throughout his career. His alleged daughter, overwhelmed by her fathers past accomplishments, can only watch in awe, asking him if he was in pain while doing the stunts. The two began crying, an action that many commentators tied to the actors long-strained relationship with his daughter, Etta Ng, who was born out of wedlock. Jackie Chan and his daughter crying while watching some of his old movie scenes is the most wholesome thing. One user, Chocolatelavender, commented that the scenario is every fathers goal to make their children proud, Thats every dads goal before were gone, to be something y(our) child is proud of. However, another user, Coriandertree, argued that the lady in the video is not Jackie Chans daughter, Thats not his daughter. In real life, his daughter and him dont have a relationship, he disagreed . Jackie Chan, a renowned international actor and martial artist, has captivated audiences worldwide for decades with his impressive stunts and charismatic movie performances. He has become a household name in Nigeria, admired for his unique and captivating style. However, there have been controversies in the past regarding his relationship with his daughter. This claim has sparked ongoing discussions and speculations, prompting DUBAWA to investigate the matter further. After a thorough analysis of the purported video, DUBAWA discovered that it bears a striking resemblance to a scene featured in the movie Rush On. Upon reviewing the movie, it became evident that the alleged video was, in fact, a scene from the film. Furthermore, DUBAWA searched and discovered that the actress in question was not Etta Ng, Mr Chans biological daughter, but actress Liu Haocun . DUBAWA also verified Mr Chans official Facebook and Instagram accounts to see if he had posted the video scene and publicly acknowledged a reunion with Etta, but no such posts were found. News outlets had also not reported any similar development. Newspaper outlet Hollywood Life has reported that the rift between Mr Chan and his 23-year-old daughter, Etta, whom he had with 1990s beauty queen Elaine Ng, continues. Hollywood Life quotes Etta as saying, Mr Chan is not in my life, and I will never consider him my father. Yahoo also reiterates the strained relationship between the two, explaining that Chan had never been there for her. Distractify reports on how, despite being married to his Taiwanese wife, Joan Lin, since 1982, Mr Chan had a sexual affair with Elaine Ng, an encounter the veteran actor himself described as something wrong. The claim is misleading. The video is from the 2023 Rush On, and the actress in the scene is co-star Liu Haocun, not Mr Chans biological daughter. Moreover, the relationship between Mr Chan and his daughter remains strained, according to media reports.",1
"Claim: An X user claims that Trump has signed an executive order to withdraw the US from the WHO. Verdict: True. Updates from the White House confirmed that President Trump has signed an executive order to withdraw the US from the WHO. On Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States (US). Following the inaugural ceremony, several claims about his declarations and actions flooded social media. One such claim is an X post by Poo Base (@PopBase) which claimed that Donald Trump has signed an executive order to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization (WHO). This raised many concerns in the comment section, with questions about whether the move is good, and what it means for global health efforts. We also found this claim on Facebook here and here . We decided to verify the claim as part of DUBAWAs media literacy role and our fight against information disorder. According to White House updates on presidential actions on inauguration day, Mr Trump withdrew the US from the WHO. The United States intends to withdraw from the WHO. The presidential Letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations signed on January 20, 2021, that retracted the United States July 6, 2020 notification of withdrawal is revoked, a part of this report reads. Recall that in 2020, Mr Trump, in his first Tenure following the COVID pandemic, withdrew the US from the WHO despite it being described as illegal. However, after taking office in 2021, Joe Biden overruled this in his first act in office by declaring that the US would reengage with the World Health Organization (WHO). News reports by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC ), ( CNN ), and The New York Times confirm this new order by Mr Trump on Jan 20, 2025. Available news reports and updates from the white house confirmed that President Trump has signed an executive order to withdraw the US from the WHO.",1
"Claim: Simon Ekpa tweeted an image showing the corpses of Nigerian soldiers allegedly eliminated by Biafras men. Verdict : Mr Ekpas image has no connection with Nigeria or its military, and the narrative depicted is misleading. On July 25, 2024, Simon Ekpa, a self-acclaimed separatist agitator of the Indigenous People of Biafra, posted two images on his X handle with laughing emoticons. The first showed three dead men in military uniform inside a bush and the second showed a heap of half-bitten mangoes. These images have since gone viral with various captions depicting the corpses as men of the Nigerian army killed during an attack on IPOB (The Indigenous People of Biafra) soldiers. For instance, @MidBrgie , a user, mocked the deceased soldiers with his repost, saying that the Zoo terrorists of the Nigeria military went to EAT mago and slept off. The terms Zoo and Terrorists are how supporters of IPOB describe Nigeria and its soldiers, respectively. Upholding this story, Biafra War Room, another user said the soldiers were killed while destroying Biafras land, killing their women and children. You saw them been deployed in our land to kill our women and children, burning down our houses shops & to kill at will, but BLA / BDF eliminated the threat, he wrote in his post. Known for inciting violence in South-Eastern Nigeria through his sit-at-home orders, the Finish-based Mr Ekpa was declared wanted by the Defence Headquarters in March 2024. Over the years, DUBAWA has debunked multiple claims posted on his social media handles. Due to the inciting nature of the post and Mr Ekpas reputation, we decided to verify the image shared. We reverse-searched the image and found it linked to a recent face-off between soldiers and terrorists at a military outpost in the Savanes region of northern Togo. As reported by Journal Du Togo, a Togolese newspaper, the said terrorists launched this attack on July 20, 2024, killing 12 Togolese soldiers, injuring several, and taking away and destroying military equipment and weapons. In the process, the Togolese army also neutralised 40 of the attackers. The image posted by Mr Ekpa has no connection with Nigeria or its military. The narrative also used to portray the incidence is misleading.",1
"Claim: Ronaldo is getting married on Tuesday, April 2, 2024, according to a Facebook user. Verdict: Insufficient evidence. Georgina Rodriguez, Ronaldos girlfriend and mother of his children, has only teased that she could get married in May. However, she did not mention the name of the football star she was about to get married to. In 2022, former Manchester United star and five-time Ballon dOr winner Cristiano Ronaldo hinted he is open to marriage to his girlfriend, Georgina Rodriguez, but has sidestepped the reality of his intention by stating it was not in his immediate plans. A Facebook user, Simplesports , recently posted that Ms Rodriguez, who has been with the Portuguese international since his stint at Real Madrid, has announced a wedding date. Simplesports wrote, Cristiano Ronaldo is getting married today. Along with the caption is a wedding invitation indicating that an anonymous individual, represented by a love emoji, will marry Ms Rodriguez. The ceremony is purported to occur in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Tuesday, May 5, 2024, by 7:00 PM. The post has already earned over 34,000 likes and 572 comments and has been shared 1,200 times as of Tuesday, April 2, 2024. DUBAWA surveyed the comments that followed the post and realised that while some believed the assertion, others did not. Congratulations, they (would) both make a beautiful couple. Viva Amor, Marilyn Marmol commented . Although I have been waiting forever for this, I think this is fake, Ute Kokomma Okoh commented . Due to the virality of the post, DUBAWA decided to verify it. DUBAWA looked at the invitation details and noticed that despite the mention of a rendezvous for the wedding, there was no mention of the grooms name. Formal wedding invitation cards typically contain the name of the groom and bride, who is about to wed, but this did not. This is important because it not only reveals their identity but that of the families to be joined in holy matrimony. Moreover, sports news outlets, such as Essentially Sports and Sports Brief , have largely dismissed the announcement as a speculation, without any certainty. DUBAWA also viewed Mr Ronaldos Instagram page, where he is an active user with about 627 million followers, but nothing of the wedding details is linked to any of his posts. Besides Ms Rodriguezs teasing announcement on her Instagram story, none of the parties involved has been reported to have said anything further about the speculated development. No sufficient evidence validates or counters the claim that Mr Ronaldo is getting married to his girlfriend, Ms Rodriquez. The wedding invitation does not mention the grooms name, and no report from any parties involved says anything about the event.",0
"Claim: A Twitter blog claimed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) asked women in Anambra to avoid using make-up on November 6, when the states gubernatorial election will be held. INEC had asked women to avoid using makeovers on the election day for proper identification. As the Anambra elections scheduled for November 6 draws near, several information have been circulating regarding the readiness of INEC to ensure a successful election. Aside from the fears expressed over the safety of voters due to the rate of insecurity in the region, INEC said the body had successfully implemented 12 out of 14 activities in the timetable and schedule of activities for the election including the provision of non-sensitive materials for the governorship election. A Twitter blog, Naija PR on 17th of October made a post on its Twitter handle explaining that INEC had informed Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day. The post reads: INEC has told Anambra women to avoid using make-up on Election Day. The post, which had garnered over 700 retweets, was greeted with doubts from some people who expressed reservations about the accuracy of the report. Despite this, so many other Twitter users and pages shared the same information on their timelines with the same piece of information. Other news outlets also reported the news as seen here , here and here . Findings by Dubawa showed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) indeed asked women coming to cast their votes during the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election to avoid using make-up on the election day. In a report on several credible news platformsas seen here and here , the INEC State Deputy Director, Gender Desk, Chika Osuji, gave the directive on October 17 in Awka. Osuji had attributed the development to the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) that the agency would deploy to capture voters faces during the poll. Osuji had said The BVAS will be used during the Anambra gubernatorial election to enable voters to use their fingerprints during accreditation at the polling units. I know many women may not be able to engage makeup artists due to restriction of movements; but for those who cant do without makeups, we appeal to you to minimise the level of the painting. If we cant read your fingerprints we can read your face, and if we cannot read your face, you are not a registered voter, and we will not allow you to participate. Explaining the BVAS, Barrister Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee said the system uses fingerprints or facials for efficient voter accreditation. In situations where the fingerprint of the voter fails, the face of the voter will be captured to allow them cast their votes . However, if there are heavy makeovers, the person may not be identified. A civil society organisation which also serves as an election observer during the Isoko South State Assembly Constituency bye-election in Delta State had earlier hailed the initiative , saying the BVAS will reduce human interference in the electoral process. It further described it as a robust and efficient way to guarantee the credibility of the voter accreditation and result management process to promote transparent elections. The claim that INEC advised female voters to avoid using make-up on election day is true. Findings by Dubawa showed that this is due to the BVAS system that will be deployed.",1
"In October 2024, a former chair of Nigeria's electoral commission, Prof Humphrey Nwosu, died . Nwosu chaired the National Electoral Commission (NEC), now known as the Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec), from 1989 to 1993 and presided over the historic annulled election of 12 June 1993. But some messages circulating on Facebook in Nigeria claim that the current Inec chairperson, Prof Mahmood Yakubu , has also died after a brief illness. Yakubu is serving his second term . He was first appointed by former president Muhammadu Buhari in 2015 and reappointed for a second term in 2020. One of the Facebook begins : Breaking News: INEC Chairman, Professor Yakubu, Passes Away in London After Brief Illness. Reports indicate that he went to bed in good health but woke up experiencing a severe medical emergency. Despite efforts by his family to provide the best care by transferring him to London for treatment, he was pronounced dead, it adds. The same claim appeared on Facebook here and here . ( Note: See other instances of the claim at the end of this report. ) But is the chair of Nigeria's electoral agency dead? We checked. Inec chairperson is alive As a well-known figure, Yakubu's death would have been widely reported by trustworthy local and international media. The absence of any credible news reports suggests that this is a death hoax. Rotimi Oyekanmi, spokesperson for Inec, told Africa Check that Yakubu was well. The Inec chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, is alive, hale and hearty, Oyekanmi said. We also found a video of a TV interview in which Yakubu commented on Ghana's elections on 7 December 2024. Death hoaxes targeting public figures are a form of misinformation. They exploit public attention and can cause confusion. The false claim also appeared here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"CLAIM: A viral WhatsApp message link claims the WHO is giving out 500 Euros support . FALSE. The claim that the WHO is giving out 500 Euros as support fund is false as analysis of the link shows the website is a new website and has no link with the WHO. The WHO has also distanced itself from the link in a statement. A link going viral on WhatsApp with the World Health Organisations (WHO) logo claims that the WHO is giving out 500 Euros support. Dubawa opened the link to see what the website holds and followed the instructions. The link, once opened, has a congratulatory message on top which reads, congratulations you have been selected to benefit from the support provided by the World Health Organization for 500 Euros After this message comes another instruction that requires one to answer three questions before one can benefit. The first question seeks to know your business type with three options; official, worker, and unemployment. Any option you pick leads to the second question which seeks to know your marital status with three options; single, married, and divorced. Similarly, whatever option you pick leads to the third question which seeks to know your age group; 18-30, 30-40 and 40-70. This shows this site is a phishing website seeking details of people. Below these questions on the site are comments by users who claimed to have either received the support fund or gotten the code. After answering all three questions, your answers are reviewed and a pop-up message tells you how much your subsidy amount has been set at and requires you to complete the steps by sharing to five groups or persons on WhatsApp after which you can now click get withdrawal code. The request to share to WhatsApp is also a characteristic of phishing sites. Going through the websites and following the instructions, Dubawa noted several red flags. First red flag was the link address which did not contain the organisations name like its official website and other WHO related sites do. Also Dubawa checked the website on duplichecker , and found the website is less than a month old as it was created on December 28, 2020. Another red flag is the grammatical errors found on the website from the congratulatory message, to the question on the business type which had unemployment as an option instead of unemployed, to the question on relationship status that gives the option divorce instead of divorced. Dubawa also reached out to the WHO for answers. The organisation released a statement on Monday January 4, 2021, distancing itself from the link. A link claiming that the World Health Organization (WHO) is offering 500 EUR ($US 615) in benefits to people who answer three questions is a scam. This fraudulent scheme asks for personal information on individuals and despite using the WHO logo is not in any way associated with the organization. Excerpt of the WHO statement. The WHO warned the public to be wary of such deception and not send money or personal information to anyone or any site claiming to be awarding funds, jobs, grants, scholarships, or other benefits on the behalf of WHO. The organisation also provided a link where the public can report scams . The claim that the WHO is giving out 500 Euros is False. Dubawas check and analysis of the site show this and this was supported by a statement from the WHO organisation.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user asserts that an American court has just sentenced three Nigerians to a joint number of years in prison for running online scams. Verdict: Contrary to the claim, DUBAWAs findings show that the sentence has been passed on Nigerian nationals since 2017. The claim is misleading. With the rise of technological advancement and digital innovation, internet fraud has become a disturbing issue, leading to a significant increase in the number of fraudsters arrested in Nigeria. A Facebook post shared on June 12, 2024, features a photo of three Nigerian citizens alleging that they were recently given weighty sentences in the United States of America for defrauding people of a huge amount of foreign currency. Part of the caption accompanying the image reads: A court in Mississippi, USA has sentenced three YORUBA men to 235 years in prison for running online scams that duped people out of tens of millions of dollars. At the time of this report, data available on the post shows that it has amassed about 25 times, with three comments and liked once by users of the application. Checks by DUBAWA show that the claim has gone viral on X. See here , here , and here . DUBAWA resolved to verify the claims authenticity as part of its mandate to combat misinformation. To check the claims veracity, we subjected the attached image to a Google Lens search and found results suggesting news stories about the court case. According to a 2017 report by Vanguard newspaper, the alleged Nigerian nationals were sentenced to a combined 235 years in prison for running an international fraud network that duped people out of tens of millions of dollars through online scams. Similarly, other media outlets like Punch and Daily Post reported the court sentence. Using the available information, we scoured through the official website of the United States Department of Justice Office of Public Affairs. We found a press release about the development published on May 25, 2017. Three Nigerian nationals, who were extradited from South Africa to the Southern District of Mississippi in July 2015, were sentenced to prison this week for their roles in a large-scale international fraud network, the statement reads in part. Evidence gathered by DUBAWA reveals that the news of the court sentence is old, contradicting the claims recency as alleged by the Facebook user.",0
"Claim: A viral video on social media platforms alleged the invasion of the National Assembly complex by operatives of DSS eleven days before the 2023 General Election. Verdict: MISLEADING. The video shared as breaking news on most social platforms is an old video from 2018. On February 14, 2023, social media platforms in Nigeria were washed with a video of heavily armed masked security operatives believed to be members of the Department of State Service (DSS) barricading the entrance of the National Assembly complex, Abuja. The viral video shows a male member of the House of Assembly visibly angry and questioning the authority of the security operatives who said they were acting based on an order from above. In Nigeria, order from above connotes that the directive was given by a superior command, possibly from the presidency. The man in the video could be heard asking, Order from above? What above? What happened to the above? Are they above the God that put them there? Is that what you called for? Do you call for this kind of change? This impunity of the highest order! You closed Nigeria house? In the one-minute, 35 seconds video, the masked armed operatives could be seen taking positions in front of the National Assembly. In contrast, some other people, presumably journalists and staff of the National Assembly, were seen recording the happenings with their mobile phones. The video has been seen on Facebook, WhatsApp, TikTok, Twitter, and other social media news platforms. On Facebook, within seven hours of its upload by LadyK Ifeoluwa , the video has been viewed 44,000 times, had 1,400 shares, 330 comments and was liked 1,000 times. On WhatsApp, concerned relatives shared it in groups and sent to individuals. On TikTok, it was shared by @paulthegudguy with the video having 34 likes and three comments at the time it was viewed. On Twitter, the video was shared by @sasakosaChief . He also referenced a news platform ( Ne wsRescue), which uploaded the video wrapping it around a narrative that the military had taken over the National Assembly. The NewsRescue platform seems not credible as no name of the publisher and correspondent were provided no telephone number or address except an email address associated with the editor. The timing of this video and the varying narratives is dangerous, especially as the DSS recently questioned Femi Fani Kayode over a post on his verified Twitter handle @realFFK suggesting that some notable Nigerians are planning a coup. No doubt, the video can cause panic, fuel unrest in parts of the country and can prevent registered voters from coming out on election day to exercise their franchise. Due to the virality of the video, its implication on our democratic system and its potential to destabilise the country at a time when the nation is preparing for another general election, DUBAWA finds verifying the report crucial. A keyphrase search on the web revealed that the video had been uploaded since 2018. The two minutes, 37 seconds video was shared by Channels Television on YouTube on August 7, 2018, and has 76,463 views. The same video was also uploaded on Channels Television Facebook page on the same day, with the post having 203,000 views and being shared 6,200 times. On YouTube, the news platform wrote that the masked security operatives and officials of the Department of State Service (DSS) arrived at the National Assembly very early on Tuesday morning, barricading the entrance to the complex. Coincidentally, the fake story also began circulating on a Tuesday, but this time on February 14, 2023. We also found the same video on another YouTube channel, Chosenozo, uploaded on the same day (August 7, 2018) with 51,989 views. The video is a more extended version (11 minutes, 15 seconds real-time recording). The originator of the video intentionally put out an abridged version of this video from 2018 to mislead the public. It is important also to note that the video is being shared when members of the National Assembly are on recess in preparation for the 2023 General Election beginning on February 25th . The legislators proceeded on recess on January 25, 2023, and are billed to resume on February 28, three days after the Presidential and National Assembly election scheduled for February 25, 2023. Although many social media users believed the story and went on to share it, some social media users were quick to point out that the video was an old one. At the same time, some of them said they were within the National Assemblys premises on the day when the fake news popped up. Our verification shows that the video is not recent because it happened in 2018, and the National Assembly was in recess when it was shared. Therefore, the claim that the Department of State Security operatives, DSS, have hijacked the National Assembly is misleading. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with Harmony FM to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"CLAIM: A screenshot of a purported AP headline shows the president of the USA, Joe Biden, calling for the cancellation of Nigerias presidential election. FINDING: A visit to the AP News website and the presidents official social media handles showed that Mr Biden had not made any utterance regarding the outcome of Nigerias 2023 election. A keyword search on Google showed that the last time the US president spoke about Nigerias election was on February 23, when he called for a peaceful and transparent election in Nigeria. VERDICT: INCORRECT. SOURCE: Associated Press, Reuters News. DATE: 01-03-2023",1
"Claim: TikTok users claim residents can get paid for snoring in the United Kingdom. Verdict: Misleading! Our findings revealed that individuals in the UK do not receive payment specifically for snoring. However, if a health condition impacts their daily activities, they may be eligible for a Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Sleep apnea, characterised by snoring, among other symptoms, is one such condition. Developed countries are renowned for establishing social welfare programmes to aid citizens or residents who face challenges in supporting themselves due to disabilities or unemployment. While many people have benefited from several of these initiatives, Visa Sponsorship , a TikTok channel, has announced that people can get paid for snoring in the UK. This post has received diverging responses, with some users demanding that those who endure the presence of a snoring individual should also be compensated. A user, Habeeb147, thought he was overly qualified to receive the benefit. He wrote: I am over qualified pls, how can I get the benefit? Conversely, others like Agnes Rogers expressed scepticism over the information. She wrote, Dont believe it. The whole country will be trying for it. Apart from TikTok, similar claims have also been shared on Facebook, as seen here , here , and here . DUBAWA conducted this verification to set the records straight. Not everyone who snores has a health condition. Snoring can occur due to sleeping position, alcohol consumption, or the airways anatomy. It is common for people to snore occasionally without it indicating a severe health issue. However, persistent or loud snoring could be a concern, especially if accompanied by other symptoms, such as daytime fatigue or gasping for breath during sleep. Snoring is usually considered harmless. However, you might be eligible for PIP in the UK if it is due to sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. It can be caused by obesity, enlarged tonsils, or underlying health conditions. When left untreated, it can lead to daytime fatigue, irritability, and an increased risk of health problems like high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke. Apart from the claimant, several other reports have confirmed that UK residents could be eligible to receive the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) if they have sleep apnea. PIP is a UK government initiative established to provide extra living costs to people living with long-term physical or mental health conditions in the UK. As explained on the UK government website, applicants are only eligible if they are already 16, have a long-term physical or mental health condition or disability, and have difficulty doing everyday tasks, including getting around. While the government recognised physical and mental health conditions as eligibility criteria, there was no explicit mention of sleep apnea or snoring, as announced by the claimant and other blogs. PIP has two parts: a daily living part and a mobility part. The daily living fund assists with everyday tasks like preparing food and bathing, while the mobility fund aids in getting around. Applicants eligibility for each part and the amount they receive are determined by the difficulty level they experience in these areas. If their life expectancy is less than 12 months, they will automatically qualify for the daily living part, with eligibility for mobility based on their needs. Beneficiaries will receive an amount ranging from 72.65 to 108.55 per week for the daily living part and from 28.70 to 75.75 per week for the mobility part. This payment is tax-free and only receivable every four weeks. Applicants are expected to contact the UK PIP department and have a form delivered within two weeks. After this form is completed and returned, they are to wait for feedback and a possible call for assessment. Other documents needed for the application are seen below: People do not get paid for snoring in the UK. However, one might be eligible to receive Personal Independence Payment (PIP) benefits if one has a health condition that affects everyday tasks.",0
"Elizabeth Ogunbamowo Claim: A viral video resurfaced on Wednesday, 30th June 2021 claiming members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) staged a mass protest against the recent rearrest of their leader, Nnamdi Kanu. It showed IPOB members displaying their flags and chanting war songs. The viral video is misleading as it is a 2015 video which resurfaced and is being circulated to sell a narrative that IPOB members constituted a nuisance after the arrest causing a lot of gridlock in Port Harcourt. On Tuesday, 29th June 2021, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, announced the re-arrest of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of separatist group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Malami said Kanu was intercepted through the collaborative efforts of Nigerian Intelligence and Security Services on Sunday 27th June. He said Kanu had been brought back to Nigeria in order to continue facing trial for 11-count charge against him after jumping bail in 2017. Kanu was first arrested in Nigeria on October 14, 2015, following years of his campaign for the sovereign state of Biafra. He was granted bail in April 2017 but fled the country after soldiers invaded his residence in Abia state during a military clampdown on IPOB members. While on the run, the separatist leader piloted the affairs of IPOB from abroad. His rearrest had sparked heated reactions across the countrys political landscape, particularly among those backing activities of IPOB. Not long after Kanus rearrest, social media users started sharing a video of IPOB members protesting on a street in Port Harcourt and causing a lot of unrest linking it to the warning. Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, took to his Facebook page to share the same video with the caption, Marching for Nnamdi! I repeat this man must not die in detention. The post has since gathered over 6,000 likes on the platform with 4,000 shares. He also shared the video on Twitter and it had raked in over 1,900 retweets and 2, 600 likes as of the time of Tuesday, June 6. On Youtube, the video has also been shared by some pages such as an online blog titled Daily Post, a mimicry of the original news medium, Daily Post. This blog, a pass off of Daily Post, also published a story to this effect on its website. Other Youtube Channels on which this video was shared include: Ikeja Online Tv, Biafra Channel TV, Val Obi Channel among many others. Dubawa observed that the video that has gone viral on social media appeared in various lengths. One was 8 minutes 22 seconds long while another appeared in 4 minutes 25 seconds; another version which was shared was 4 minutes, 38 seconds. The video showed protesters who appeared to be members of IPOB in vehicles and on foot en masse on the streets with the Biafran flag. A YouTuber who shared the video on June 30, said in the background, It is happening right now in Igweocha Rivers State, Igweocha is boiling right now, our people brothers and sisters have come out to protest the arrest of our great leader. Zoo government cant silence us, no they cant do that, we cant be discouraged, Biafra is here. We are here. Forty seconds into the video, a man and a lady could be heard in the background shouting. Nna eh (Igbo word meaning Father), e dey happen for Port Harcourt oh, Biafra, Biafra, here we are, O boy see the crowd. This is the state of Biafra at Igweocha. They want to bring down the Nigeian flag, this is Biafran land. Yes, this is Biafra! Biafra, here we are, at Igweocha, declare the state of Biafra. They have removed the Nigerian flag. For Buhari to tamper with Nnamdi Kanu, he is finished. Buhari must obey Biafra. Dubawa also observed an icon at the right-hand corner of the video which represents that of a video editing app, Kine Master. The Youtuber used this video editing app, Kine master to select and edit the videos. Another Youtuber, Val Obi , rotated the same video before posting on his channel. While the original version of the video and other copies of the video showed a red truck on the left-hand side of the recorder, this YouTuber changed the view to the right hand. He claims, There is rioting at the moment in the city of Igweocha Port Harcourt following the arrest and detention of Mazi Kanu. From checks, the video had originated in 2015. One of the YouTube channels, NNTV Africa posted the video as far back as October 31, 2015, in three parts. Part one of the video is what has been copied and recirculated as a recent video. IPOB had earlier in a statement issued on 30th of June had urged its members to remain calm and had only declared that its members will flood Abuja for Kanus trial on July 26 and 27 as stated. The statement issued by the groups spokesman Emma Powerful had read, Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is presently in the custody of the Nigerian Government. This evil crime of kidnapping was masterminded by the Nigerian Government in collaboration with all those that view IPOB and Mazi Nnamdi Kanu as a stumbling block against their bid to hold Biafra in perpetual slavery. We, therefore, enjoin every IPOB member both at home and in the Diaspora and all Biafrans to remain calm because this is not the end of the road. Our leaders next court appearance is July 26, 2021, and Biafrans should mobilize and attend the court hearing. This reporter observed the picture quality of the video was not in a very high resolution. With the InVID verification Plugin, the reporter used the analysis tab to get fragments (images) from the video. The reporter further used the available reverse image search engines such as TinEye, Google image reverse search, and Yandex on the fragments produced. While Yandex did not produce any useful results, Google reverse image search showed that the video had been posted several times in the last few days on Facebook, online platforms with most results showing YouTube videos. One of the search results showed the same video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt. TinEye produced about four matches for the video when a keyframe analysis was conducted showing the same videos being uploaded in 2016 and 2019. Using the keyframe tab, InVID also allowed for a video fragmentation, where the reporter selected keyframes and with a right-click, more search engines were made available for reverse image search. With this, the Bing search engine brought up the same result of the video uploaded on October 21, 2015 titled IPOB Biafra Burning Nigeria Flags in Port Harcourt. A keyword search on YouTube also led to the video which was posted on October 31, 2015 on NNTV-Africa titled, Biafra Restoration, Nnamdi Kanus Arrest: IPOB Protest in Igweocha (Port Harcourt) Rivers State Part 1 This Fact check concludes that the viral video of protesters carrying the Biafran flag also with leaves chanting war songs is misleading as the video first appeared online in 2015. Therefore, the video could not have been connected to a recent protest against the rearrest of Nnamdi Kanu in the South-South. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with SaharaReporters to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"CLAIM: St Joseph Primary School polling station in Central Freetown is yet to start voting more than an hour after ECSL voting time officially ended. EyeWitnessNewsSL reported delayed voting at polling station 16148 at the St. Joseph Primary School eight hours into voting. With two hours to go for the polls to end officially, the report suggests the angry electorate are yet to cast their ballot. DUBAWA rushed to the centre at 6:45 GMT and confirmed that the voters were yet to cast their ballots more than an hour after voting officially closed. The polling centre manager Deborah Jaward explained that voting had been delayed due to the absence of the voting roster. According to her, the original centre manager for the polling station was chased out by the angry voters who were tired of waiting without end for the roster. DUBAWA observed armed police and military officers deployed to the station to protect the new Center Manager and maintain law and order. Around 7:30 GMT when DUBAWA was leaving the polling station, voting had still not started, and the electorates were seething angrily. VERDICT: True",1
"Last year, we saw the acceleration of AI-generated images and how they can be used to mislead people. AI generates new images using neural networks, rules-based systems, statistical methods, and other techniques. AI images can also be misleading because they do not always accurately represent what they should. For example, if an AI image shows a person, that person may not look like that. This can lead to misunderstandings. DUBAWA highlighted five times we saw how AI was used to mislead the public. X user shared images of R. Kelly performing in prison, suggesting he sells out shows in the prison yard. The tweet stirred up mixed reactions in the comment section. While some marvelled at the ability of the convicted R&B singer to excel in the prison yard, others dismissed the images of the concert as digitally generated. As of Tuesday, May 9, 2023, the tweet had gathered over 6,213 retweets, 2,082 quotes, 57 likes and 1,431 bookmarks. Our findings show that the image is not original. Analysis of the images shows they have been highly enhanced with the help of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, discrepancies abound between the details of the images and the context in which they are set. After a state of emergency was declared in New York, USA, due to intense flooding, Social Mediaz, a Facebook page, released a cautionary video to the public. The brief clip features a massive octopus crawling over a parked white car in an enclosed garage. As it reaches the windshield, the creature extends its arms, resulting in the car being crushed and an alarm blaring. The videos caption warns people to be mindful of where they park their vehicles during this critical situation. While investigating , we discovered that the video depicting an octopus crushing a car is a product of artificial intelligence. It is not only misleading; it has nothing to do with the New York state of emergency. A Facebook handle, The Pickers NG, posted on the meta parent app, Facebook, that the 2023 presidential candidate of the Labour Candidate, Peter Obi, paid a visit to the state house in Abuja, where President Bola Tinubu resides. Obi visits, Tinubu welcomes. Obi in Aso Rock villa. Part of the statement reads. While verifying , DUBAWA discovered that the photo used to represent the post had been doctored.We used a Google Reverse Image Search tool on the picture and saw a similar one was taken earlier with another person. Also, no public reports suggest such a meeting occurred between Tinubu and Peter Obi. A video clip posted by Big 9 (@Innocentzikky_) shows Nigerian singer Damini Ogulu (Burna Boy) hailing his fellow male singers, Wizkid and Davido. The tweet unsurprisingly attracted great engagement as over 1.2 million users viewed it, 1,910 retweeted, 390 quoted, 8,638 liked, and 944 bookmarked. To confirm our suspicion, we subjected frames from the simulated video to a more digitally scientific approach, using an AI-image-detecting tool, Hugging Face. After passing the clip through the tool, it identified 100 per cent artificial intelligence property. The video clip is an artificial intelligence-simulated copy of an interview that Burna Boy had in 2019 with the Breakfast Club. X user @HerStoryUG has shared a picture purporting to be Nigerian chef Hilda Baci with a certificate from the Guinness World Recordz for breaking a record of 100 hours of uninterrupted cooking. The post has already received over 53,000 views and over 500 views. Investigation using Fotoforensics suggests that the image had some edits done to it. The JPEG% in the Fotoforensics tool also shows a mass repetition of numbers. This is a red flag. This suggests that the image has, possibly, been edited multiple times. DUBAWA also ran a Tineye image search and was directed to Rawpixel, a website dedicated to publishing stock photos. DUBAWA saw the original photo captioned, Cheerful black woman showing a sign with a blank speech bubble on the website.",0
"Claim: An X user @Ne0_officiall asserts that excessive intake of oral contraceptives can cause fibroid growth. Verdict: Insufficient Evidence! There is no sufficient medical research to support this claim. Some studies suggest that oral contraceptives may increase the risk, while some suggest oral contraceptives can also be used to reduce the risk of developing fibroids. Uterine fibroids are a significant public health concern among Nigerian women. Studies show varying prevalence rates across different regions, with a 14.2% prevalence in Ogoni, Rivers State, a 6.83% prevalence in South-West Nigeria, and as high as 48% among celibate women in Ibadan . Research also suggests that fibroids are more common in women aged 2645, with cases increasing with age. Despite these figures, misinformation about fibroid causes and risk factors continues to spread on social media. Recently, an X user, @Neo_officiall, alleged that excessive use of oral contraceptives can cause fibroid growth.

Given the high prevalence of fibroids among women and the virality of the post, DUBAWA decided to investigate this. Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths that develop in the uterus. They range in size and are influenced by hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone. While fibroids are common, their exact cause remains unknown. Not all fibroids cause symptoms , but when they do, symptoms can include heavy menstrual bleeding, back pain, frequent urination, and pain during sex. Most fibroids happen in people of reproductive age. Studies show that fibroids grow when hormone levels are higher (like during pregnancy) and shrink when hormone levels are low (like during the transition to menopause). Medical research continues to study fibroids for the cause of growth and effective treatments. Two major components known for stimulating the growth of fibroids are estrogen and progesterone. Birth control pills contain both of these elements. According to the Mayo Clinic, several risk factors can increase ones chances of developing fibroids. These can include Obesity and a higher body mass index (BMI), a family history of fibroids, not having children, early onset of menstruation (getting your period at a young age), and late age for menopause. This 2021 study suggests that oral contraceptives may increase the risk of developing uterine fibroids or cause existing fibroids to grow larger, particularly due to the hormonal content, especially estrogen, which fibroids are responsive to. However, other research indicates that long-term use of oral contraceptives might reduce the risk of developing fibroid. According to Yan Katsnelson, a surgical expert, the exact cause of fibroids is not currently known. However, researchers believe they are linked to higher levels of certain hormones. Theres no one-size-fits-all rule on which birth control method is right for people with fibroids. In some cases, hormonal birth control may help regulate the menstrual cycle and prevent extreme fluctuations in progesterone and estrogen levels, explains Katsnelson. However, the influx of additional hormones may contribute to fibroid growth. Every person needs to discuss their options for birth control with their physician, especially if a diagnosis of fibroids has already been established, says Katsnelson. Another medical physician, Doctor Stan, noted that taking too many birth control pills causes fibroid growth is an oversimplification and not strongly supported by scientific evidence. Fibroids develop due to various factors, mainly hormonal changes, and the link between birth control pills and their growth is not proven. The claim that excessive use of oral contraceptives causes fibroid growth is misleading. No strong medical evidence supports this. Experts suggest that if you have concerns about fibroids or contraceptives, you should consult a healthcare professional for accurate information.",0
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp video claims a strange disease was inserted into semo imported to Nigeria, leading to the deformation of a family of eight in Lagos State. Verdict: Misleading! The image of the Mpox victim attached was from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and there is no report of any strange disease in Lagos. Semo is a type of food commonly eaten in Nigeria. Shortened for Semovita and made from Semolina, semo is made from processed wheat, a coarse, purified wheat middling of durum wheat mainly used in making pasta and puddings. It is typically cooked into a smooth, dough-like delicacy, similar to fufu or eba. Semo is often served with soups and stews, such as egusi, ogbono, or vegetables. Recently, a video circulating on social media platforms, particularly on WhatsApp, shows two individuals with pox. The voice in the 56-second footage, speaking in Yoruba, claims that the man and a woman shown ate semo and got inflicted with the strange disease from semo. The male voice in Yoruba said, Every Nigerian listening to me. May we not be afflicted with a deadly disease. I beg you in the name of God. Let us avoid semo. They said the disease is injected inside semo. In Lagos, where I am currently, eight people ate the semo two days ago. May we not see any calamity. May we not turn deformed. A whole family has been deformed. Please, whoever listens to this and does not share will be unfortunate, and your children will be unfortunate. I beg you, in the name of God, whosoever shares this with their contacts to save peoples lives, may you not contract any deadly disease. In the name of God, let us avoid eating semo. They are inserting the disease inside semo, especially those imported from India. The disease is in India, and they want it to get into Nigeria. Please note that they have detected the disease inside semo. Please let us transfer this to everybody. Thank you. A similar claim also appeared on Facebook . Due to the sensitivity of the claims in the video and its virality, we conducted a fact-check. We tried to detect the disease displayed in the video by conducting a Google Reverse Image Search on the images shared in the footage. The result showed that it was Mpox. We showed the video to medical practitioners, and they confirmed the pox on the people shown in the video, suggesting the disease is Mpox. According to the Senior Registrar, Department of Family Medicine, Federal Medical Centre, Owo, Dr Samuel Aluko, The lady up looks more classical for a case of Mpox. The man under looks more like chronic complicated skin lesions. It could also be a severe case of Mpox, though. We then conducted a reverse image search, which revealed that the picture of the infected woman in the viral video was taken during the Mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Guardian reported on June 26 about the virus in South Kivu Province of DRC. Similar reports linking the image and the disease outbreak to DRC can be found here and here . The World Health Organisations (WHO) June 14, 2024 report confirmed that Mpox had killed 654 people out of the 14,626 cases in DRC in 2023 and as of May 26, 2024, 7,851 cases were detected, including 384 deaths. WHO reported that a 19-year-old woman with a macular skin rash was discovered in the province on June 1, 2024. This evidence confirmed that the image of the woman shared in the viral video was not from Nigeria but from DRC. We also found no evidence of a new Mpox outbreak in Lagos State or any report of a family of eight that contracted the disease, as the viral WhatsApp video claimed. However, reports revealed that there was a deadly outbreak of Mpox in Nigeria in 2017, followed by another outbreak in 2022. Before 2017, the Centre for Disease Control reported that the last time that cases of mpox were reported in Nigeria was in the 1970s. According to the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), Mpox is a rare infectious viral zoonotic disease (i.e. an infection transmitted from animals to humans). CDC reported that the disease was discovered in 1958 when two outbreaks of a pox-like disease occurred in colonies of monkeys kept for research, hence the name mpox. The first human case was identified in a child in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. The incubation period ranges from six to sixteen days but can range from five to twenty-one days, with symptoms typically lasting two to four weeks. However, cases can be severe, particularly in children, pregnant women, or individuals with suppressed immune systems. According to the World Health Organization WHO , Mpox is characterised by common symptoms such as skin rash or mucosal lesions, fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. WHO also says it can be transmitted to humans through physical contact with an infectious person, contaminated materials, or infected animals. Laboratory confirmation is achieved by PCR testing of skin lesion material. Treatment for Mpox involves supportive care, and in some circumstances, vaccines and therapeutics developed for smallpox and approved in certain countries can be used. As of October 2022, mpox has been reported in 13 African Union (AU) Member States: Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Liberia, Morocco, Mozambique, Nigeria, Sudan, and South Africa. The spread of the disease has shown a concerning geographic distribution, with cases now documented in various regions across the continent. The disease has been recorded in African countries , including Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Congo, Cte dIvoire, DRC, Gabon, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. No evidence was found that a strange disease was imported into Nigeria from India through semo. Also, there was no report of a deformed family of eight in Lagos State. Our investigations also show that the video used to make the claim is from Congo. The claim is, therefore, misleading. This report is produced for the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame Karikari Fact-Checking Fellowship in partnership with The Hope Newspaper to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in Nigeria. Editors Note: The word Monkeypox was reviewed to mpox, following the WHO guideline.",0
"Claim : Nigerias agricultural revolution has created over 13 million direct and indirect jobs. Verdict : Insufficient evidence/Unproven Recently, President Muhammadu Buhari has been releasing statements quoting the success of his administration. Mr Buhari said he served Nigerians well to the best of his ability and disappointed no one. In December 2022, the president, while speaking at an interactive session in the United States, noted that targeted interventions by his administration in the agricultural sector had created 13 million direct and indirect jobs. In a statement, Garba Shehu, the presidential spokesperson, quoted him as saying, This agricultural revolution has led to the creation of over 13 million direct and indirect jobs. Mr Buhari also said the country has been able to handle the systemic shock caused by both COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war on global food supply chains and attendant price spikes. The countrys agricultural sector has battled several challenges over the years, which limited its growth despite numerous interventions. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the sectors low performance is caused by many challenges impacting its productivity. These, the organisation said, include; poor land tenure systems, low levels of irrigation farming, climate change and land degradation, low technology, high production cost and poor distribution of inputs, and limited financing, among others. According to Statista , employment in agriculture is the share of individuals working in agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing to produce a good or service for profit or pay from the total employed. The latest data from the World Bank (2019) shows that employment in agriculture is only 35% of the total employment rate in the country, whereas, in 1991, it was 51% of the total employment. The World Bank further aggregated the number of Nigerias Labour force in 2019 to 62.9 million . For context, given the labour force in 2019 is 62.9 million and the total percentage of unemployment equals 10.7% , which is 6.7 million, it means the total employment figure for the same year is 56 million. It also means since employment in agriculture is 35% of total employment (56 million), there are estimated 19.6 million agriculture-related jobs. The question then is how many of these people are engaged in paid or unpaid services in the agriculture sector? The World Bank, in its explanation, noted that total employment involves wage and salaried workers (also known as employees); and self-employed workers, with its subcategories: which included self-employed workers with employees (employers); self-employed workers without employees (own-account workers), and; members of producers cooperatives and contributing family workers (also known as unpaid family workers). The situation explained in Nigerias economic update by the World Bank showed that between 2005 and 2015, Agriculture accounted for 40 per cent of Nigerian workers. The report noted that labour has gradually shifted from agriculture to other sectors over time. Over time, employment in less-productive sectors like agriculture and manufacturing have dropped, and employment in the highly productive resource sector has gone up, it added. Meanwhile, Nigerias unemployment rate is currently at 33.3%, with about only 30 million persons fully employed, according to the latest data by the National Bureau of Statistics. This shows that theres been an increase in the unemployment rate from 10.4% in Q4 2015. Prof Segun Ajibola, former President of the Chartered Institute of Bankers of Nigeria (CIBN) and professor of economics at Babcock University, told the Nigerian Fact-checkers coalition (NFC) that theres been a steady decline in the number of people engaged in Agriculture from independence till date. On how to measure indirect job opportunities in the Agricultural sector, the don noted that Agriculture has spillover effects and involves both backward and forward integration. For example, those who are involved in primary agriculture, they produce, these are people who grow yam, rice, produce palm oil, palm kernel, cotton and so on, thats the primary segment. Those involved in the secondary level, the transporters: those who transport from the farm to warehouses, those who keep the products in warehouses, the silos, the marketers, those who eventually process those products. For instance, cocoa, those who buy cocoa and those who transport cocoa, there are some cocoa processing factories in Nigeria like Ile Oluji cocoa processing factory, all those working there will be counted as people working in agriculture, thats forward integration. Then there are those who use those products like Nigeria Breweries, Guinness, Nestle food, some of them have what they call farmer-grower skill. They give money to farmers; thats what we call backward integration. They give money to farmers to produce corn, which they process into other products, the same way Nestle foods have farms where they grow some of these products; all of them, for example, Nestle food will regard themselves as working in Agriculture because what they do is to process agricultural products to finished products, a segment of PZ will see themselves as still working in Agriculture, same thing with Guinness, same thing Nigerian Breweries. Marketers, transporters, sellers, those who work in agro-allied businesses like cocoa processing farms and so on, all of them will be counted as those who work in agriculture and agricultural-related businesses. They will regard themselves as part of employment in agriculture. I think its from that angle that the president is looking at it as opposed to the World Bank looking at agriculture from the angle of those involved in agriculture as a means of livelihood. President Buhari came into power in 2015. As observed, employment in agriculture as a share of total employment has witnessed a steady decline from 37.51% in 2014 to 35% in 2019, according to the World Bank. From the foregoing, there is no sufficient evidence to show that the current administrations interventions in the agricultural sector have provided 13 million direct and indirect jobs in the country. This is evident in the fact that the sectors employment rate has been declining. When the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition contacted Shehu to highlight the data source quoted by Mr Buhari, he referred the researcher back to the speech the president gave in New York, which does not serve as a credible source. There is insufficient evidence to support Buharis claim that interventions in Agricultural have provided 13 million jobs in Nigeria as the unemployment rate in the sector was on a decline during the period reviewed.

"Claim: A Facebook user posted a video containing the logo of Channels TV promoting a joint pain remedy. Verdict: FALSE. According to Channels TV, the station did not promote joint pain remedies. DUBAWAs findings show that the video is AI-generated. A video containing Channels TV brand and logo was posted on a Facebook page , called Family Tree on January 7, 2024. The 42-second-long video, which was used to promote a joint pain remedy, featured a newscaster and a medical practitioner, Dr Rashard Dacus, who was introduced as the producer of the remedy. The first speaker said Dr Rashard promised to pay a million euros to anyone who cant cure joint pain with his new remedy. While corroborating the first speaker, Dr Rashard also boasted the remedy has 100% efficacy, adding that joint pain will disappear forever, and the joints will return to a healthy state after applying the remedy. He further claimed that more than 100,000 customers have already saved themselves from joint pains after applying the remedy, which he said, if used several times a day, will hasten the process of joint regeneration. The caption attached to the posts also further promotes the joint remedy. It reads, SCIATICA, ARTHRITIS, SPONDYLOSIS, LUMBER SPONDYLOSIS can be a constant struggle, but with us, Immediate and Permanent Cure is Guaranteed as our medication is specifically designed to provide immediate and permanent relief for the joint, muscles and spinal pain caused by arthritis, spondylosis, and lumber spondylosis. Our powerful formula targets the underlying causes of inflammation, reducing pain and improving mobility permanently.

As of Thursday, May 8, 2024, the video had over 8,000 views, 87 shares and 310 comments. DUBAWA decided to verify the video because of the inconsistencies in voice and speakers. DUBAWA observed that the audio and the mouth movements dont match. This inconsistency suggests that the video has some deep-ware effects, which means its AI-generated. We further decided to verify the video on Deepware , and the result said the video was suspicious. Deepwares findings Also, we observed that some unique patterns and features of Channels TVs flagship news at 10, which generally include the name of the newscaster, and downline rolling of other major news, are missing in the video. We also contacted a Channels TV reporter, Kayode Okikiolu, whose video clip was used to promote some health products. He confirmed, The video is fake and not from us (Channels TV). Weve had to make several disclaimers on these kinds of videos. Okikiolu also clarified that the first speaker in the video, who appears like a newscaster, doesnt work for the station. According to DUBAWAs findings, the video is AI-generated. In addition, information obtained from a worker at the Channels TV station indicates that the video didnt emanate from the station.

"The Obasanjo Foundation is offering a N20,000 grant to support all Nigerians, but time is running out! This amazing opportunity is ending soon, and you need to apply today to qualify, reads a post on Facebook. Olusegun Obasanjo is a prominent Nigerian politician and retired military general. He served as Nigerias military ruler from 1976 to 1979 and as the countrys democratically elected president from 1999 to 2007. The 30 September 2024 post features a graphic with Obasanjos photo. It also has a link and encourages users to click for application. The same claim and graphic can be found here , here and here . But is there any truth to it? We checked. Scammers are using foundations name We found it suspicious that none of the links in the posts took us to the Olusegun Obasanjo Foundation website . Instead, the links directed us to various blog posts about visa sponsorship opportunities in the US and the UK. Some blogs asked for our full name, account number and location. Revealing personal details online can make you susceptible to phishing attempts . Attackers may try to trick you into giving them more personal information, which they may use to commit fraud. We also searched the foundations website and social media accounts and found nothing about the N20,000 grant.

"CLAIM: News reports by Kakaaki News, Sahara Reporters, Punch, and some other media outlets have it that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by Interpol. True. The claim that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria is true but it is not a recent development. A news report by Kakaaki news , Sahara Reporters, Punch and some other media outlets, on Tuesday December 29, 2020, claimed that EUR 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria by the International Criminal Police Organisation known as Interpol. According to these reports, this was contained in a statement on the organisations website titled Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed. Dubawa visited Interpols site to find this statement and also conducted a keyword search. The result of this search showed similar reports on this was published by the Punch on Tuesday, December 29, 2020, and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020. The search also led to a document published on April 14, 2020 on Interpols site titled Unmasked: International COVID-19 fraud exposed as claimed in the report. The document noted that this happened around March when countries were going into Lockdown and the need for face masks which was one of the control measures for COVID-19 was high. This case of fraud was described as a sophisticated fraud scheme that used compromised emails with payment for the supply of face masks. According to the document, the German health authorities contracted two sales companies in Zurich and Hamburg to procure EUR 15 million worth of face masks. An agreement for an initial delivery of 1.5 million masks was made, in exchange for an up-front payment of EUR 1.5 million. The buyers initiated a bank transfer to Ireland and prepared for delivery, but before the delivery date, the buyers were informed that the funds had not been received and that an emergency transfer of EUR 880,000 straight to the Dutch supplier was required to secure the merchandise. The email address linked to a legitimate company in Spain selling face masks was compromised and its website cloned. This was uncovered by financial institutions and authorities across Germany, Ireland, and the Netherlands. The document showed that nearly EUR 500,000 of those funds had already been sent to the United Kingdom, all of which was destined for an account in Nigeria. Two suspects in the Netherlands were arrested as at the time the document was released in April. Subsequently, in September 2020, another report was published on Interpol which indicated that two suspects linked to the mask fraud were arrested in Nigeria. Dubawa also reached out to Kakaki News, the Punch and Sahara Reporters on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, to enquire why this case of fraud is just being reported since the information has been released by Interpol since April 2020. As at Thursday morning, December 31, 2020, none of the news sites had responded. The claim in the reports by Kakaaki News, Punch and Sahara Reporters that 500,000 COVID-19 fraud was traced to Nigeria is true as Interpols document showed this was part of the 880,000 which had been transferred from the German company to the United Kingdom destined for a Nigerian account. This is however not a recent development as Interpol had published details of this since April 2020.",1

"Claim: Finance and Development Planning Minister Samuel Tweah and Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe claimed: the Invincible Sports Park was constructed by President Weah and his friends. Verdict: Misleading! Checks by DUBAWA show that a portion of the funds used to construct the Invincible Sports Park was budgeted for in the 2022 national budget, while other state institutions contributed financially to the project. Liberia is expected to go to polls on October 10 this year to elect new leaders, including the president, vice president, 73 representatives and 15 senators whose tenures are about to end. The elections will most likely be won or lost based on the oppositions promises and credibility or the track record, achievements or failures of the incumbent. As the campaign heats up, two senior officials of the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) led administration headed by soccer icon George Weah took to the national radio to outline the gains made by the CDC government in the last six years. Finance and development planning Minister Samuel Tweah and the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner Eugene Lenn Nagbe appeared on the state-owned media outlet, the Liberia Broadcasting System or ELBC , to talk about progress made by the CDC government. The show carried on the LBS online radio and Television, LNTV , was also covered by several media institutions, including Front Page Africa and D-TV online . During the show, the Liberia Maritime Authority Commissioner, Eugene Lenn Nagbe, claimed that President George Weah built the Invincible Sports Park with support from his friends. Commissioner Nagbe was responding to a question asked by one of the journalists on the show about whether some of the projects undertaken by the Liberian leader were executed with his personal or government funds. Nagbe said, The Pro-Poor housing and the market structure the president is building are direct results of what the people asked for when the president made his most recent counties tours. There are some projects that the president is undertaking by himself, like the Invincible Sports Park. He funded it with some support from his friends. He made this claim over the four hours show from 2:25:57 to 2:26:05 hours. Commissioner Nagbes claim was also buttressed by his colleague, Minister Samuel Tweah, during the show. Minister Tweah said, To be clear and honest with you, the Invincible Sports Park was funded by the president because people have tried to bring this president down on the basis of lies, and we are here to fight falsehood. I am happy that the Liberian people no longer believe the lie, so they are flat-footed. They are still bent on spreading lies on their Facebook pages saying that the Invincible Park was built from the government budget, no it was [not], and we are very clear on that one. Minister Tweahs comments came around the 2:35:35 2:36:14 hours of the over four-hour show on Monday, June 19, 2023. The interview has garnered over 7,000 views with over 615 comments. DUBAWA decided to verify the claim due to controversy and the interest the claim generated. To start with, DUBAWA sighted a February 9, 2021 , video in which President George Weah broke grounds for the construction of the Invincible Sports Park, located in Sinkor, Fish Market, directly opposite the home of ex-Liberian President Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. At the program, President Weah said that he felt obligated to the people of the area where the park is constructed because, according to him, it was where he used to play when he started his footballing career. The Liberian leader said, I, therefore, want you to know that I am developing this public park as my personal contribution to the people of this area. President Weah made the remarks at 35:24-36:00 minutes/seconds of his speech during the groundbreaking ceremony. But was the Invincible Park built solely with funds from the president? The Minister of State without Portfolio, Trokon Kpui, appeared to have contradicted the claim that the president built the Park from his own and friends funds. He said on the Spoon Talk programme on April 5, 2022, that part of the funding for the project came from state institutions. Minister Kpui said, This is the presidents project, but we also have funds coming from the National Port Authority (NPA) , National Social Security and Welfare Corporation (NASCRP) and the Liberia Maritime Authority (LiMA) . Minister Kpui appeared on the show in his official capacity as chief administrator of the project and made the claim on the show between 1:19:53 to 1:20:20 hours.The show was carried live on the institutions official Facebook page . According to him, the president funded 60% of the budget for the Invincible Park, and the remaining 40% came from state coffers. Despite this contradiction, DUBAWA contacted the two senior Liberian government officials through WhatsApp to provide evidence in support of their claims that the park was built solely with funds from the president. However, the two men did not reply to DUBAWAs questions posed to them. Here are screenshots of DUBAWAs questions to Minister Samuel Tweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe. DUBAWA didnt stop there. The researcher then visited the 2022 national budget of Liberia since the project was launched in 2021. DUBAWA discovered on page 10, under the summary of the Public Sector Investment Plan (PSIP), that the government of Liberia funded the construction of the Invincible Sports Park Project under code 0720. The allotment for this Invincible Sports Park project is US$ 500,000 for 2022 and projected for under the 2023 and 2024 national budget at 400,000 and 320,000, respectively. Here is a screenshot from the 2022 budget of Liberia: Based on the concessions made by the Administrator of the Invincible Park project and the facts available within the 2022 national budget of Liberia, the claim made by Minister Samuel Toweah and Commissioner Lenn Eugene Nagbe is misleading.",1
"Claim: A Twitter user shared an image of Nigerias former President, Muhammadu Buhari, shaking hands with the former President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, with a claim that the Nigerian government is backing Iran and Palestine in the ongoing IsraelGaza conflict. Verdict: MISLEADING. The image associated with the assertion dates back to 2015, and official communications from the Nigerian government advocate for diplomatic resolutions to the conflict rather than explicit support for any party involved. The Israel-Gaza conflict, a long-standing and complex geopolitical issue, has seen periods of heightened tension and violence between Israel and the Palestinian territories of Gaza and the West Bank. The conflict escalated further on Oct 7, 2023 , when the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented assault on Israel, with hundreds of gunmen infiltrating communities near the Gaza Strip. This assault resulted in about 1,200 casualties, with more than 250 individuals taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. In response, the Israeli military conducted air and artillery strikes, resulting in over 33,000 Palestinian casualties, according to Gazas Hamas-run health ministry. Meanwhile, on April 13, 2024, an X user Sir. Engr. A.Y (@A_Y_Rafindadi) made a post on his page, alleging that the Nigerian government is extending support to Iran and Palestine amidst the ongoing IsraelGaza conflict. The post included an image showing Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerias former president, shaking hands with Hassan Rouhani , a former President of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Accompanying the image was a caption declaring Nigerias allegiance to Iran and Palestine in what was termed as World War III. It read: In this world war III, Nigeria Stand With Iran/Palestine The giant of Africa is with the oppressed The post has gained traction, gathering over 1.3 million views, 24,000 likes, and 2,400 reposts. Reactions in the comment section clearly showed that people believed the post was true, with some urging the federal government to refrain from taking sides in the war. Northern Pearl (@kadunasAyomide) reacted: Which Nigeria? On behalf of Nigerians, please count us out. We just need nepa light ffs. Others also doubted the credibility of the post, questioning Buharis constitutional rights as a past president to declare support for a party in war on behalf of Nigeria. DeOtunba GCFRN1( @de_generalnoni) commented : Tinubu is President, not Buhari. So, wherever Tinubu stands, Nigeria does! This claim emerged concurrently with Irans large-scale drone and missile attacks on Israel, reportedly in retaliation for an earlier Israeli strike that resulted in casualties near the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Investigations conducted by DUBAWA reveal that the claim is MISLEADING, as the image in question predates the current conflict. A Google Reverse Image Search with TinEye and Google Lens Search on the image indicates it was captured during the 3rd Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) summit in 2015. Furthermore, DUBAWA cross-referenced the claim and found an official statement released on Apr. 14, 2024, by Nigerias Ministry of Foreign Affairs through its spokesperson, Francisca K. Omayuli, urging diplomatic resolutions between Iran and Israel. The statement emphasised both parties need to consider peaceful conflict resolutions for global stability. A keyword search revealed publications by Channels Television, ait.live , and Arise News corroborating the Federal Governments stance on the Iran-Israel conflict. The official statement, titled NIGERIA APPEALS FOR RESTRAINT FOLLOWING THE RECENT ESCALATION BETWEEN IRAN AND ISRAEL, urged both nations to exercise restraint while diplomatic efforts aimed at de-escalation are underway. While the claim of Nigerias support for Iran and Palestine in the Israel-Gaza conflict garnered significant attention, a thorough investigation by DUBAWA reveals it to be misleading. The image shared as evidence predates the current conflict, and official statements from Nigerias Ministry of Foreign Affairs advocate for diplomatic resolutions rather than explicit support for any party. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Bridge Radio 98.7FM, Asaba, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed an uploaded video showing littered bodies abandoned in an undisclosed area in the Southwest is a recent development. Verdict: Misleading. Reports from credible media outlets reveal that unaccounted bodies were found in the Soka area community, Ibadan, in 2014. On Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, a Facebook user, Nwa Biafra Info TV , shared a video showing gory and gruesome scenes of dried skulls and fresh bloody human parts in a completely abandoned building project. The user asserted that this happened recently. Aside from multiple dismembered human parts, other items discovered at the building were personal effects such as footwear and clothes. Alongside the video posted, the Facebook user wrote, The Afonja ritualists are more concerned about the coming of Biafra, but this is what is happening in their backyard-PM. The documentary clip, with a Television Continental (TVC) watermark, has amassed about 17 likes, one comment, and 23 reposts as of Sunday, Nov. 17, 2024. Due to the posts sensitivity and the existing politico-ethnic feud between the three major nationalities, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. Verification DUBAWA carried out a Google Reverse Image Search on some of the screenshots of the video clip. We came across a similar video documentary posted by TVCNews on YouTube on March 25, 2014. In the clip, TVC News reports how a secluded building believed to be a habitat for mentally deranged persons was discovered to be an abode for kidnappers who captured their hapless victims and killed them there. The discovery was made by a group of motorcyclists who had formed a search party for their lost colleague before they found the hideout. A similar video file was found on YouTube by SaharaTV , which was posted on March 29, 2014. DUBAWA then conducted a keyword search related to the incident, and we came across media reports that provided more information about it. A news report by Daily Trust on March 29, 2014, narrates a criminal den uncovered by the Nigerian Police in the Idi Mangoro area of the Soka community in Ibadan, Oyo State. According to the report, the police discovered human bones, guns, cutlasses, shoes, handbags, clothes, and other personal effects, which were found in two containers in the eight-room building. Vanguard , British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) , and AllAfrica also reported similar narratives. Conclusion Findings reveal that the video posted by the Facebook user is not recent; the video is a 2014 TVC documentary about a kidnapping den in Soka, Ibadan.",0
"CLAIM: An X user, Nwa ( @nwaadaz ), claimed that according to TCT News, the Imo state governor, Hope Uzodinma, killed more than 500 youths in his first tenure. FINDING: Over 400 deaths through violence were recorded in Imo between Jan. 2019 and Dec. 2021. In the first quarter of 2022, more than 25 fatalities were recorded. There was insufficient evidence to prove the number of youth fatalities within Uzodinmas first term; however, no death reports were attributed to him. There is also no news platform called TCT News.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims that the government of Dubai is giving out $110 as a Ramadan relief fund. Verdict: FALSE. Our research shows that the Dubai government is not distributing funds for Ramadan relief, and the message was spread maliciously. Worldwide, Muslims start their annual fast period in the month of Ramadan. During this period, information continues to flood the internet. Amid their fast, Muslims are bound to have a special need to buy foodstuffs and carry out their faith in good health which requires funds. Amid this, a message that the government of Dubai is sharing $110 as Ramadan Relief Funds, and every individual of all nationalities can apply. DUBAWA chose to verify this claim due to its virality and requests for verification. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the Dubai Ramadan relief fund mentioned in the message but did not find any. Our findings, however, showed different organisations and charities are giving out food to people during Ramadan. According to the Arab News, Dubais ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al-Maktoum, started a program to sustainably provide hundreds of millions of meals to those in need during Ramadan. We subjected the link to Whois.com to verify the websites source, and we found that the website was created in Oyo state, Nigeria, not in Dubai. Another red flag is that people who visit the website can bypass the form on the page without filling out the application form, suggesting it is a malicious act. Another glaring red flag was the presence of fake testimonial statements. This is a common technique online con artists employ to entice prey into their cave. Despite not being clickable, the links to the alleged remarks still serve as a trickery tool for users. After clicking submit without inputting my details on the landing page, we came across messages that revealed the number of applicants is limited to 50,000. After submission, the website requests additional information from visitors before granting entry to the grant, as seen in the screenshot below; a trick commonly used by con artists to get people to visit their websites. Part of this additional information which is the request to share with groups and friends, explains why the message went viral on WhatsApp. Our findings show that the Dubai government is not giving out Ramadan relief funds, and the message was shared with ill intent. Hence the claim is false.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user, Agozi Commedy, claims that the suspended Rivers State Governor, Siminalayi Fubara, has been arrested by the federal government for disobeying President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Verdict: False. The Federal Government did not arrest Governor Fubara. The viral video is from a previous, unrelated event. On March 18, 2025, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu declared a state of emergency in Rivers State and suspended Governor Siminalayi Fubara, Deputy Governor Ngozi Odu, and all elected state assembly lawmakers for six months. Retired Vice Admiral Ibokette Ibas was appointed as the sole administrator to oversee the states affairs during this period. The decision followed a prolonged political crisis in the state, attributed mainly to the power struggle between Fubara and former Rivers Governor Nyesom Wike, now Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. Following the declaration of a state of emergency, various narratives surfaced on social media. A Facebook user, Agozi Commedy , shared a video alleging that the Federal Government (FG) had arrested Governor Fubara for disobeying President Tinubu. The post was captioned: Breaking News: Federal government has just arrested Rivers State Governor SIM Fubara for disobeying President Tinubu Asiwaju. The post has garnered significant engagement, amassing over 2,000 comments, 14,000 reshares, and more than 11,000 likes. Among those who commented, Adanna Okoye remarked, Anytime I want to listen to fake news, I come to this page. Similarly, Chukwudinma Chukwurah urged others to disengage, stating, Please, lets unfollow this man. He is full of lies and fake news! Meanwhile, another user, John Omidiran, from Osun State, Southwest Nigeria, expressed scepticism about the situation, saying, Can someone explain this mans offence to me? Honestly, this doesnt add up. We have terrorists, Fulani herders, and kidnappers wreaking havoc across the country, yet no serious action is taken against them. Why are the rights of Rivers people being trampled on so recklessly? Due to the issues sensitivity, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. We conducted a Google Keyword search using Fubara + Arrest + Tinubu but found no reports from reputable media houses confirming the governors arrest. We used InVID WeVerify to analyse the over eight-minute video attached to the post. The footage shows a chaotic scene with security aides protecting the suspended governor while police officers fired tear gas canisters. At five minutes 43 seconds in the video, Governor Fubara is seen addressing the press. He said, Its very unfortunate that we are experiencing this kind of situation again, which is similar to what happened nine years ago. Everybody who knows me understands that I stand for truth. I am concerned that a taxpayer-funded facility is being destroyed, just to please someone. From what I have observed, security has been compromised. They were shooting at me, but it doesnt matter because we all die one day. I want to die so that when people hear the name Fubara, they will remember that I died for this struggle. I am not against anyone, and I have no hidden agenda. I dont know where all these attacks are coming from, but as the Chief Security Officer of the state, I should be the one ensuring safety, he added. Further analysis revealed that the video is old and was taken during an incident a year ago when the Rivers State House of Assembly was gutted by fire. Parts of the video were found in a previous news report by Channels Television titled, Gov Fubara Inspects Burnt Rivers Assembly Complex Amid Police Resistance. DUBAWAs findings reveal that Governor Fubara was not arrested but vacated the Government House following his suspension. The claim that the federal government arrested Siminalayi Fubara is false. The viral video circulated is an old clip from a previous event involving the governors visit to the Rivers State House of Assembly after a fire incident. There is no credible evidence to support the claim of his arrest.",0

"Claim: Consumption of meat and dairy products affects climate change . Verdict: True. According to the United Nations, climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. Recently, discussions around climate change and its effect on the planet have continued to increase. Humans worldwide have experienced climate variability from extreme weather events to floods, water scarcity, and storms. However, there has been a significant increase in the last hundred years due to the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels include coal, oil, and natural gas, formed from the fossilized, buried remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. These are said to contain high carbon content, and burning them causes what is known as the greenhouse effect in Earths atmosphere. A salient matter of discourse is the number of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere caused by both natural and human activities. It has been argued that most of these changes are caused by human activities, mainly burning fossil fuels which lead to global warming. During the 2nd World Ocean Summit, Asia-Pacific, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) called for urgent action to maintain planetary health, which was described as essential for human and societal health and a pre-condition for climate-resilient development. Also, during COP27, the United Nations Secretary-General called for a continuous fight for climate justice and ambition. Amid these conversations, a Twitter user, @MikeHudema, who identifies as a climate campaigner, tweeted the relationship between industrial meat and climate change. In the tweet , Hudema urged people to reduce their consumption of meat and dairy products. He said this would help combat the climate change challenge and soil, air, and water pollution. Industrial meat is leaving a trail of destruction all over the world. One of the most useful things everyone can do to combat climate change, soil, air and water pollution, is to eat less meat and dairy, his tweet reads. But how true is this claim? DUBAWA consulted experts and studies on climate change to ascertain the veracity of the tweet. A 2014 report from the think tank Chatham House established a link between human consumption of meat and dairy products and climate change. The report noted that greenhouse gas emissions from the livestock sector account for about 14.5% of the global total, more than direct emissions from the transport sector. However, a major concern in the study is the lack of concerted efforts to reduce the consumption of meat and dairy products. Seven years later, the IPCC, in its April 2022 climate change mitigation report, identified certain actions people can take to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that lead to global warming from academic papers. While the scholars called for a dietary shift, they noted that emerging food technologies such as plant-based alternatives to animal-based food products and controlled environment agriculture could substantially reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from food production. It was suggested that humans reduce the intake of meat, adding that diets high in plant protein and low in meat and dairy areassociated with lower GHG emissions. They noted that agriculture is a key driver of land-use change, causing deforestation and wetland drainage. Meanwhile, the United Nations noted that cattle used for both consumption and inedible outputs are responsible for about 65% of the livestock sectors emissions, followed by pig meat, buffalo milk and meat, chicken meat and eggs and small ruminant milk and meat. It further stated that 44 per cent of livestock emissions are from methane, 29 per cent from Nitrous Oxide and 27 per cent from Carbon Dioxide. Writing on the effect of methane on climate change, the Environmental Defense Fund stated that methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere. DUBAWA spoke to Jennifer Uchendu Kalu, a climate change campaigner and Susty Vibes founder. Uchendu explained that there is indeed a link between the consumption of meat and dairy products and climate change. According to her, greenhouse gas emissions affect climate change, and gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) are all emitted into the atmosphere through livestock agriculture. In fact, according to the FAO, 14.5% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions can be linked to livestock agriculture. This is the basis of this argument, and thus it is correct to say that livestock agriculture in the way it is currently practised can lead to global warming and, thus, climate change, she said. One school of thought believes that as humans, by continuously demanding meat and dairy products, we increase the need for the production and ultimately increase livestock agriculture-led emissions. These emissions come from feed production for the animals, their digestion processes (burping and excreting), and the transportation and processing of their by-products. Let us also not forget that emissions are also released when manures are stored, Uchendu explained. She, however, noted that beyond milk and meat production, there is also wool production, cheese and gelatin, which also play a role in climate change. A more overlooked factor is that these animals often graze on the land and further reduce the vegetation that could help mitigate the GHGs, she said. Speaking on actions humans can take to help curb the effect of climate change, Uchendu expressed the belief that science and technology need to scale lower emissions pathways for the agriculture sector. She suggested that research and development can be better explored to determine the best ways to convert the methane produced into biofuels and other useful energy products. These processes are still very small scale, she said. While I advocate for flexitarianism where people generally reduce their meat and dairy consumption because of the current global limitations, I believe that the first option is the more realistic way to go as not everyone will want to switch to plant-based protein, Uchendu added. The claim that consuming meat and dairy products affect climate change is true. Experts have suggested, among other things, cutting down on the consumption of these products to mitigate their effect on climate change.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims taking pain relievers or anesthesia after COVID-19 vaccination is dangerous and both should be avoided for two years. The claim that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided after vaccination is false and misleading as our findings and WHOs response shows this. Aches or pain are common side effects of coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine. Vaccination side effects show that the vaccine is teaching the immune system how to recognize and attack SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19). To relieve this pain, some vaccinated persons turn to pain relievers or killers. A recent viral WhatsApp message claims that pain relievers like diclofenac should be avoided for two years after taking COVID-19 vaccine. According to this message, the adverse effects of the vaccine and pain relievers have been fatal, making reference to a doctor who allegedly killed his wife by injecting her with diclofenac after COVID-19 vaccination. PLS IF YOU HAVE BEEN VACCINATED FOR COVID 19 AVOID DICLOFENAC OR ANY ANAESTHESIA FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE VACCINE WITH THESE HAVE BEEN FATAL. Excerpt of the viral WhatsApp message. Taking a close look at this claim, Dubawa noted this claim sounded and looked like the one fact-checked earlier in April, 2021 . While the April claim says taking Pain killers after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine is dangerous and can lead to death, the recent claim says to avoid diclofenac and any other anesthesia if vaccinated. Both claims seem to be tied to the same story of a doctor who killed his wife by injecting her with a dose of Diclofenac after she had earlier received the COVID-19 vaccine. Dubawas earlier check however showed that the womans death was not vaccine related. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on Anesthesia and pain relievers. Anesthesia are medicines used during tests and surgical operations to numb sensation in certain areas of the body or induce sleep to prevent pain and discomfort. This search led to checks by Quint and India.com discrediting the claim that getting anesthesia after vaccination is dangerous Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains. There are different pain medicines, with advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others and each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Pain relievers go by many names ; Analgesics, Narcotics, Painkillers, Pain medicine etc. There are different types of pain relievers but they can be classified into two types! Over-the-counter pain relievers and prescribed pain relievers. Over-the-counter (OTC): These are pain medications available at stores for any adult to purchase. They include; Acetaminophen, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ( under which Ibuprofen and Diclofenac fall under), Combination drugs (contain both acetaminophen and aspirin, an NSAID), and Topical (cream, gel, spray or patch) that can be applied directly to the skin. Prescription : These medications are only available with a prescription from a healthcare provider as they provide stronger pain relief. They treat severe or chronic pain. These include; Antidepressants, Anti-seizure medications, Muscle relaxers, Opioids, Steroids and Topical. A look at studies and reports show that the arguments around pain relievers and vaccines is on the possibility of pain relievers curbing the necessary immune system response necessary to fight the virus like this study shows not on any health danger The Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in its recent report in June on how to relieve COVID-19 side effects warns against pain killers before vaccination but notes it can be taken afterwards with due consultation with your doctor. Dubawa also reached out to persons who have been vaccinated in Nigeria to get their experience if any with pain relievers. Mr Richard Akinwunmi, who has gotten his complete dose (two dose) of the Astrazeneca vaccine explained he took ibuprofen after his first dose and there was no adverse effect. For my first dose, no pain until the night of that day. I experienced a heavy shoulder and muscle spasms so I took ibuprofen for 3 days and a lot of water. For my Second dose, I started feeling feverish (malaria kind) almost immediately and I took a lot of water and paracetamol for 3 days. Excerpt of Mr Richards response. Alhassan Bala on the other hand said he only took paracetamol. Maybe because I am the type of person that hates pills, I only took paracetamol after I started experiencing fever a few hours after the dose. The fever went away after about 24hours. Excerpt of Alhassans response. Just like Alhassan, Lateef Sanni also took paracetamol which he said was recommended by the health officials where he got his vaccine and he was fine afterwards. I only took paracetamol if that qualifies as a pain reliever. The doctors instructed that if I feel funny that I should use paracetamol. And that was what I did. Immediately I took it, the malaria-like symptoms I had disappeared. Excerpt of Mr Lateefs response. Speaking to health officials, Dubawa gathered pain relievers can be taken after vaccination not before. A medical officer, Lynda Effiong-Agim said it is not advisable to take pain relievers before vaccination but they can be taken afterwards as long as the person has no previous contraindication using NSAIDS. If the person previously had no contraindication to using NSAIDS then there is no issue because NSAIDS arent for everyone. However the NSAID is not to be taken in advance before vaccination, it is afterwards to help with pain, e.t.c. Excerpt of Dr Lyndas comment. Another health official, a gynaecologist, Dr Monday Idoko, at Garki hospital Abuja said the claim is not scientifically justifiable and if true maybe a coincidence. On paracetamol which most of the vaccinated persons we spoke to said they took, he clarified it is also part of pain relievers. But the claims arent scientifically justifiable. It may be a coincidence. Diclofenac is an abused drug bought over the counter so if it were true, we would have had a lot of these cases. Excerpt of Dr Idokos comment. Dubawa also reached out to the World Health Organisation (WHO) via email. The organisation responded saying there are no recommendations that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided for two years following vaccination. The WHO added that pain killers may be used for injection site pain following vaccination, but generally paracetamol is what is recommended. Diclofenac is an anti-inflammatory drug, and not an anaesthetic agent. The oral preparation of diclofenac is used to reduce inflammation and pain. The injectable version of the drug is only recommended for severe pain, often post-operative pain, and given under close medical supervision. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported following diclofenac, which from the news reports is felt to be the cause of death in the doctor in India. Pain killers may be used for injection site pain following vaccination, but generally paracetamol is what is recommended. There are no recommendations that diclofenac or anaesthesia should be avoided for 2 years following vaccination. Excerpt of WHOs response The claim that diclofenac or anesthesia should be avoided after vaccination is false and misleading as our findings and WHOs response shows this.",0
"CLAIM: FIFA bans Lauren James for the rest of the tournament after the red card. VERDICT: MISLEADING . Credible news outlets report that the England international has been suspended for only two matches in the ongoing Womens World Cup tournament. A Facebook user, Bem Raphael Aondongu, on Tuesday, August 8, 2023, posted that England international, Lauren James, has been banned from the ongoing Womens World Cup tournament. He shared that Ms James was penalised with a red card for stepping on Nigerian defender Michelle Alozie in their round-of-16 encounter last Monday . Ms James trampled on Alozie while the latter remained on the floor. The England forward stepped on her Nigerian counterpart in a goalless match that had worn on to the 87th minute. The unprovoked encounter had immediately earned her a yellow card, and then a red after a Video Assistant Referee (VAR) check. Consequently, the penalty meant Ms James would be excused for the remaining part of the match. It wouldnt be allowed to participate in Englands quarter-final encounter with Columbia after winning Nigeria in a 4-2 penalty shoot-out . The Facebook post drew in 108 likes, 33 comments and three shares as of Monday, August 14, 2023. Facebook users in the comment section seemed to applaud the action, with some opining that the punitive measure should have been extended. Very good. Floxy Nobis wrote . It is supposed to be for two tournaments. The act is derogatory, honestly speaking. Jethro Asiwe reacted . After a red card had been awarded to Ms James, it was rumoured that the Chelsea stars moments at the Womens World Cup may have ended abruptly. Independent reported how Ms James could be ruled out from participating in the rest of the tournament, as she awaits a Fifa Disciplinary panel hearing and attributing it to the England forwards misconduct with Nigerian defender Ms Alozie. EUROSPORT had also reported that Ms James would miss Englands next game against Colombia in the quarter-finals and could be out for longer depending on the outcome of FIFAs disciplinary panel hearing. FIFAs rules outline every principle related to handing out a red card to a player. Specifically, Article 10.5 postulates that a player would be suspended from his teams next match after he has stepped off the match he had been awarded either a direct or an indirect red card. It further accords the FIFA disciplinary committees power to act as it sees fit. It also says in Article 10.6 that if a player who has received a red card cannot serve the sanctions due to his teams elimination, or the last match of the game, the sanctions will be carried over according to the provisions of the Disciplinary Committee code. Due to the uncertainty around the claim, we decided to fact-check it. We searched Google for sanctions by the Fdration International de Football Association (FIFA). We discovered an update by Yahoo! news that the England forward has gotten only a two-match ban. Further searches linking other news outlets revealed a sky sports report that Lauren James would miss the quarter-final and a potential semi-final of the World Cup . Independent also corroborates that story, saying that she has been handed a two-game ban which means she will miss both Saturdays quarter-final with Colombia and the subsequent World Cup semi-final should her teammates progress. Reuters also quotes FIFA saying that the FIFA Disciplinary Committee has imposed a two-match suspension on Englands player Lauren James It said, The suspension will be served for the FIFA Womens World Cup quarter-final and the next international fixture following that. The claim is misleading. Recent media reports indicate that Ms James will only serve a two-match ban given to her by the FIFA disciplinary committee.",0
"Claim: News circulating on WhatsApp claimed that former ADP Presidential candidate Mohamed Kamarinba Mansaray who raped a minor has died in prison. Verdict: False. The Sierra Leone Correctional Center has said Kamarainba is not dead. The Human Rights Commission has also debunked the news as fake. Former Presidential candidate for the Alliance Democratic Party, Mohamed Kamarainba Mansaray has been at the centre of public speculation for the last three years. The politician was arrested in July 2020 for raping a minor. Kamarainba, as he is popularly known, was sentenced to 32 years in jail last year, having been found guilty on all four charges. He was charged and sentenced to jail alongside his co-conspirator, Marion Arouni. Throughout his trial, Kamarainba has been sick, and at some point, he had to be transferred from prison to the 34 Military Hospital. The message about his death was first posted on WhatsApp. The message claimed to have been authored by the Human Rights Commission Sierra Leone, something the institution has now denied. To verify this, DUBAWA contacted the Human Rights Commission on whether they authored the brief statement claiming that the politician had died in jail. The commission denied and later released a statement following a number of media enquiries. In the statement , the human rights body stated: The Commission has not received any such information from the relevant authorities regarding Mr Mansaray, who is currently serving his jail term at the Freetown Male Correctional Center. DUBAWA also contacted the Sierra Leone Correctional Service, where Kamarainba is. A spokesperson for the service, Cecile-cole Showers, said the politician is not dead as rumours claim. When asked if Kamarainba is alive, Mr Showers said: Yes, he is alive. He also added that Kamarainba is not well. He is not keeping well at the moment; as we speak, he has already been admitted to a hospital, Showers said. Shortly after the interview, The Correctional Service also tweeted , denying the claim. Kamarainba is not dead, as widely rumoured. The Sierra Leone Correctional Service has debunked the claim.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user by name J Howard Mattaldi alleged in a post he made in a private group (Fries FM) that Mr. Dorr Cooper, Inspector General at Commerce Ministry, was not listed amongst graduates of the University of Liberia 104 Convocation even though he had joined other candidates for the occasion. Verdict : True! The University of Liberia 104th Commencement Convocation graduation booklet obtained by this Researcher shows that Inspector Dorr Cooper wasnt listed for graduation. A viral post of Commerce Inspector Dorr Cooper circulated on Facebook Sept. 18, 2024 during the graduation and convocation of the State-run University of Liberia. According to the posts, the Inspector had gone to the ceremony ground in his graduation gown and with support from family and friends, hoping to earn a Degree that day. But a Facebook user, J Howard Mattaldi Jr., alleged on Facebook that the Government officials name was not on the list of graduates from the College of Public Administration. Liberia Commerce Inspector General D. Dorr Cooper escaped UL graduation after confirming he wasnt on the list, the poster said. Screenshot of the post below The posts generated 166 comments and 154 reactions at the time of this writeup. Persons who commented argued that the claim was fake and only intended to tarnish the Officials reputation. Screenshot of comments The claim was also posted by Shine Liberia blog and social media users. The trendy nature of the post and mixed reactions to the claim led DUBAWA to initiate a fact-check. DUBAWA decided to acquire the official booklet of the graduation in order to authenticate the names on the list. Our Researcher obtained the 104th Commencement Convocation booklet of the University possessing all the names of candidates that graduated from the College of Public Administration. After a thorough search in the booklet particularly under Public Administration, the name Dorr Cooper wasnt found. This shows that the Inspector wasnt listed for graduation as expected by him and his family. Screenshot of Public Administration Graduates listing below The researcher further contacted Inspector Dorr Cooper via his official Messenger account to understand the circumstances under which he attended a graduation ceremony with his family when he was not on the list of graduands. However, the Inspector didnt respond to our inquiries even though the messages were delivered to him as indicated by messenger. Screenshot of messages below DUBAWA did not get a response for this. Meanwhile, DUBAWA contacted the Chairman of Public Administration Department at the University of Liberia Mr. Arthur B Sharpe via telephone to find out whether Inspector Cooper was eligible for graduation and given clearance by the university as expected. In response Chairman Sharpe told DUBAWA that Inspector Cooper wasnt given clearance for graduation by the University of Liberia on the basis that all the information he (Dorr Cooper) presented to the Department for verification were fake. According to the Chairman, the school records show that Dorr only sat a single course since his entry into the school and failed the course. Before graduation, I obtained information on the students for verification before the issuing of clearance and every information this fellow called Dorr Cooper provided was fake. The University did not give him clearance from the record I have, Chairman Sharpe said. Based on DUBAWAs findings, it is true the Inspector wasnt listed for graduation because he wasnt cleared by the University for graduation. .",1
"Claim: A Facebook user, Edwuadotv, posted a video of a robot flying a completed building to a site and claimed that it is the latest innovation in infrastructure from Chinese engineers. Verdict: FALSE. A computer graphics (CG) generalist on TikTok, identified as @Augingenuity, created and edited the video. The video portrays existing movable buildings, which differ from what it depicts. A Facebook user, Edwuadotv, shared a video showing a robotic drone conveying a fully completed building to a residential area on Jan. 19, 2025. He claimed the video is evidence of the latest infrastructural development in developed countries like China. He also said that potential buyers will not spend much to procure such a building, as the completed structure will be driven to the allocated site. As of Jan. 23, 2025, the video has gained 268 reactions, 12 comments and 36 reshares. The video can be found here and here . The differing thoughts identified in the comments sections prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. DUBAWA used a keyframe from the video on Google Lens to conduct a reverse image search. We traced the source to a TikTok account, @augingenuity , a computer graphics (CG) generalist and three-dimensional (3D) animation specialist. In the original post, he controlled the animated building with a gamepad, which depicts evidence of visual effect editing. He also used hashtags like #animation and #cgi, which indicated that the video was edited content. As of Jan. 22, 2025, the TikTok post gained over 32,000 bookmarks, 463,000 reactions, and 8,500 comments since it was posted on June 21, 2024. Within the period, it has also gained over 7 million views. The video is not the first visual effect content he posted on his page. He had created videos of a large elephant on a pedestrian road dancing to the Gwo Gwo Gwo trend, a gigantic robot threatening a popular content creator after losing a grip-strength contest, among many others. Considering Nigerias existing infrastructural innovation, we investigated possible cases of movable buildings. A sample we found on a YouTube real estate post was built in Lagos within 80 hours. The storied building was built in prefabricated bits throughout the timeframe. Other movable buildings DUBAWA discovered through keyword searches, like here and here , were not airlifted as a ready-made edifice, contradicting the video in the claim. The video claiming to show a robot airlifting a completed building is false. Our investigation revealed that the video was a digital creation.",0
"Claim: A user on Facebook claims China has implanted chicken organs in pigs to make them produce chicken eggs. The image used to support the claim was extracted from a different context and doctored to suit the bogus narrative. This claim is false. When a user on Facebook, Uchenna Dike, shared an image of what he claimed to be pigs laying eggs, alongside the heading: China plants chicken organs in pigs for faster and more eggs production, the comment section of the post became hilarious. Making us to realise; or to understand that some scientific knowledge is purely satanic, i.e. please add chicken-pig egg to my rice, one user, Cyprian Ajunwo, commented. However, some doubts raised by other users stirred some questions. Mammal animals can never lay eggs I still remember that one very well. It is impossible, Asiwaju Olajide Toby, contested. Not entirely surprising, the post garnered over 5000 re-shares and close to over 2000 reactions within just two days of its appearance. Notably, the claimant and the commenters could not point to the actual source of the narrative, as most of the users apparently seem to believe it. The same narrative made headlines on a Ghana-based news website, Vimbuzz: China plants chicken organs in other animals for faster egg production , featuring the same image as the one shared on Facebook. But still, what is the probability of such a great invention taking place? No doubt, great scientific and technological inventions have been referenced to the Chinese and in the past also, the world has witnessed great revolutions in different areas, yet, the claim that pigs are genetically modified to lay eggs seems to be a question that requires more answers than the one that already meets the eyes. When a Yandex reverse image search was conducted on the alleged image, the results showed the image was taken out of context and manipulated to cast a new and bogus narrative around it. Originally, the alleged image appeared on a Ukrainian agricultural promotion website . The image was used, along with a post that was promoting common individuals to venture into cattle ranching. Apparently noticeable is that even the alleged pigs, as initially claimed in the image, were actually a group of ranch cows. This is not the first time the image was used to spread false claims. In 2018, a Ukrainian-based news site, Top news debunked a claim that used the image of the cows to allege that cancer was implanted in cows to boost their growth. Pigs or mammals can not lay eggs. The possibility is just not feasible, Dr Jeremiah Milon, chief veterinarian at Animal first, said. Also, according to Scientific American, Only two kinds of egg-laying mammals are left on the planet todaythe duck-billed platypus and the echidna, or spiny anteater. These odd monotremes once dominated Australia, until their pouch-bearing cousins, the marsupials, invaded the land over 71 million to 54 million years ago and swept them away. New research suggests these two kinds of creatures managed to survive because their ancestors took to the water. Pigs can not lay eggs and mammals in general cannot. DUBAWA has uncovered that the image used to spread the alleged narrative was doctored. This claim is false. This fact-check was produced by DUBAWA in partnership with Code for Africas PesaCheck, with support from ICFJ.",0
"Claim : A viral WhatsApp post claimed that Orange Sierra Leone is offering its old customers free data. Verdict : False! In a public notice on its Facebook page, Orange Sierra Leone stated that it is not giving out free data to old members. A WhatsApp post circulating in Sierra Leone claims that one of the leading telecommunications operators, Orange SL, is offering free data to its old subscribers. Congratulations to all Orange Old Customers. Orange is offering Free Data to all OLD SIM CARD. 6 months old sim-5GB, 1 year and above-10GB, 5 years and above-50GB and 10 Years plus-Unlimited. Hurry Now and check if your ORANGE SIM CARD is eligible for this offer, a message on the purported data bonus reads. The post also directed people to an accompanying link that they can follow to access that offer. The Alleged promo has been shared widely on WhatsApp in Sierra Leone. A click on that link shows FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention-Access Blocked. DUBAWA decided to investigate this claim in its campaign against mis-and-disinformation in Sierra Leone. DUBAWAs checks have shown that Orange Sierra Leone is not giving out free data to its old customers, as alleged. The telecommunication company dismissed the allegation by issuing a Public notice via their Facebook page. Please disregard any fake advert you may encounter on the internet. Be careful of scam ploys and phishing websites. Keep your information private, the denial read in part. Orange SL will communicate to you directly and on our social media pages as and when there is a promotion, it added. Further checks conducted by DUBAWA online did not reveal any online information supporting the claim that Orange Sierra Leone offered its old subscribers free data. On June 4, 2024, DUBAWA contacted the Head of Communications, Digital and Sponsorship, Orange Sierra Leone, Philip Emeh, to ascertain whether the claim was true and determine what measures they are taking to prevent future occurrences of such fraudulent acts. We have issued a public notice debunking the claim that we are giving out free data to old customers. We will not be saying anything more, he said. DUBAWA contacted some individuals who shared the link in their WhatsApp groups to trace the source of that information, but only one responded. The individual who could not say his name said someone forwarded the link to him, but he later found out it was not authentic when he clicked it. Also, the alert FortiGuard Intrusion Prevention-Access Blocked given to persons who dared to click on the link indicates that the web page violated an internet usage policy or is a malicious website. Based on DUBAWAs findings, it is not true that Orange Sierra Leone offers free data to old SIM card subscribers, as alleged. This report is produced for the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KarKari Fact-Checking Fellowship in partnership with Epic Radio to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in Sierra Leone.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message on security tips claims that the message came from the Inspector General of the Sierra Leone Police Ambrose Sovula. The Assistant Commissioner of Police, Brima Kamara, says the viral message on WhatsApp containing security tips is not from the IGP. A WhatsApp message which has been shared on various WhatsApp groups as well as to individuals containing security tips claims to have come from the Inspector General of Police Ambrose Sovula. The message which has nineteen (19) tips explains how citizens should secure themselves. Dont allow your children who cant recognize voices to open doors for strangers/visitors, says tip one. The message furthered that, stay away from any strange man, who looks like a pregnant woman; he may be carrying harmful products. The message concluded by requesting that it should be rebroadcast to family and friends, adding that security is everybodys business. The Assistant Commissioner of the Sierra Leone Police Brima Kamara confirms to Dubawa that the viral WhatsApp message did not come from his boss nor from the Sierra Leone Police as an institution. This was made known to Dubawa when he was contacted via WhatsApp to verify the message. No! Even though some of the security tips contained therein are appropriate for ones personal security; they are not coming from us, says ACP Brima Kamara. To further cross check such a claim, Dubawa searched the website of the Sierra Leone Police to see if such a message was posted to no avail. Conclusion Whilst the content of the security tips are commendable, Dubawa is setting the record straight that no such message came from the Inspector General of Police nor from the Sierra Leone Police institution itself. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with The Daily Trust to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: A viral video clip claims vaccines are targeted at eliminating Africans. The claim that vaccines are meant to eliminate Africans is false and the statement on vaccines is not related to COVID-19 vaccines. With the growing spread of misinformation and different theories surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine in relation to Africa, a 30-second video going viral on social media claims there is a plan to eliminate Africans through vaccines. In the video, a witness named Dr Robert O. Young who was answering questions from a set of panellists said there were too many people in the world and there was the need to get rid of them starting off in Africa. For the purpose of sterilization and population control, there is too many people on the planet we need to get rid off in the words of Bill Gate, at least 3billion people need to die. So we will just start off in Africa. We will start doing our research there and we will eliminate most of the Africans because they are deplorable, they are worthless, they are not part of this world economy so they have their rights taken away and they are surpressed and experimented Excerpt of Dr Roberts statement. Dubawa researched the witness (Dr Robert O. Young) in the video and discovered that Dr Young is an American naturopathic practitioner and author of alternative medicine books. Dubawa also conducted a Google reverse image search with screenshots of the video which led to a report on January 13, 2021, by Everyday.ng . According to this report, the video was filmed at the International Tribunal of Natural Justice (ITNJ) sittings in Bali, Indonesia at the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into the Weaponization of the Biosphere in June 2019. The video has, however, been gaining traction since emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. This report led us to the ITNJ website where we saw different clips of this sitting from different days without finding Dr Youngs statement. The 10-minute clip of Day one covered the opening introduction of the Bali sitting in June 2019. Day two clip covered ITNJ Trustee Emeritus, Sacha Stone, giving a speech. The link available on the site for the full clip of the seating led to a YouTube video that could not be accessed. Dubawa then went ahead to search for Dr Youngs testimony at the ball seating. Dubawa found a Youtube video of one hour and 38 minutes that contained Dr. Robert O Youngs testimony . The video was posted on Youtube with a short summary that explained that Dr Youngs statement provides the how and why the state department put him out of business and in jail because of his natural treatment to cure cancer. Going through the video, Dubawa learnt Dr Young was trying to make the point that the different vaccines given to children in the first six years of their life, from the measles vaccine to the polio vaccine are more poisonous than helpful. The short clip going viral was trimmed out of the full testimony towards the end of the video, where Dr Young quoting Bill Gate, said these vaccines are meant to kill and reduce the world population. It is, however, noteworthy to note that the claim on depopulation by Dr Young accredited to Bill Gate has been debunked . While the statement in the viral clip is true and taken from the original full video of Dr Youngs testimony, it is not related to COVID-19 vaccines. Dubawas findings show that while it is true that Dr Young made such a statement in an original video from the ITNJ seating, his statement was taken out of context as his statement and the seating have no relation with COVID-19. The time of this seating also discredits this videos connection to COVID-19 which happened 5 months before COVID-19 broke out in December 2019. This makes the claim false and misleading.",0
"Claim: An X user posted that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for refusing to sing the national anthem, for protests, and for insulting the president and politicians, or religious leaders, among others. Verdict: False! President Tinubu has not made any new laws or imposed fines against protesters or other issues. Rather, the House of Assembly speaker is set to read a bill on the same on the floor of the House. Over the years, Nigeria has grappled with complex issues surrounding freedom of speech and expression. Under military regimes , when freedom of speech was severely curtailed, laws like the Public Order Decree were enacted, which gave authorities broad powers to restrict public gatherings and expression deemed detrimental to national security. While the military regime is now history, recent years have seen a resurgence of debates around freedom of speech in Nigeria. The government has faced criticism for introducing or considering laws that some perceive as encroaching on fundamental human rights. Some notable examples include the Social Media Bill , the Anti-Fake News Bill , and the Hate Speech Bill, among others. These proposed laws have sparked intense debate among civil society groups, journalists, and human rights advocates, who fear they could undermine democratic principles and create a chilling effect on free expression in Nigeria. As these details continue to be debated in the public space, on August 13, 2024, an X user, @MickaelCbearnard, posted a tweet claiming that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for Nigerians who refused to sing the national anthem for protests, insulting the president and politicians or religious leaders among other penalties. The tweet reads: While we were dragging SA (South Africa), Tinubu began passing a new law. The bill prescribes 10 years in prison + 5 million fine for anyone who refuses to sing the national anthem. It also prescribes 5 years for anyone who protests. And finally, 2 years in prison for anyone who insults Tinubu. And its not just that. If you insult any politician, you get 2 years in prison. Ranging from councillor, LGA chairman, SSA to SA to governor or PA to a traditional ruler. If you insult a pastor or Imam, 2 years in prison. If you receive donations from the diaspora for protest or campaign against Tinubu, 20 years in prison. As of August 15, 2024, the post had been viewed over 950,000 times, generating over 6,300 likes, 7,400 retweets, and 850 comments on X. It has also received reactions from users, who expressed outrage and disbelief. An X user, @Amazirostanley , wrote: This is an abuse of the power of the office of the president. It will lead to more protests. He should arrest us all. Protest is a right. @mosdefdbest wrote: These people are lower beings than animals. Gradually, this man is turning the democracy we dont have into an autocracy. While expressing scepticism at the post, @Quests_Ans queried: Does he have that right? Having observed the various reactions and engagement generated by the post and its virality by other platform users, DUBAWA decided to fact-check it. The bill seeking fines and imprisonment for Nigerians who embarrass leaders, among other issues, was sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Tajudeen Abbas, not President Tinubu. Mr Tajudeens bill, introduced on 24 July 2024 and titled the Counter Subversive Bill, according to its explanatory memoranda, seeks to criminalise subversive activities by associations, organisations, militias, cults, bandits, and other proscribed groups in Nigeria. Further defending and taking ownership of the bill being tagged to the president, the speaker, in a statement by his media aide, Musa Krishi, said: It is currently at the introductory stage and has not yet been subjected to detailed legislative scrutiny. The statement further notes that it falls within Nigerias anti-terrorism framework. The Bill awaits the second reading, during which the general principles will be debated. However, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria clearly breaks down the power relations of the three arms of government, which are clearly defined to ensure the promotion of good governance. The provisions of section 5(1) of the 1999 Constitution are very apt in this regard. Our findings show that the claim that President Tinubu prescribed some years in prison and fines for protesters who refuse to sing the national anthem and insult the president and politicians, among other issues, is false.

"Claim : A religious leader in The Gambia, Imam Abdoulie Fatty, asserted that female genital mutilation (FGM) has no health implications. Verdict : This claim is false. DUBAWAs checks have revealed there are serious health consequences for anyone who undergoes female genital mutilation. FGM has no health benefitsit can lead to immediate health risks, as well as a variety of long-term complications affecting womens physical, mental and sexual health and well-being throughout the life course, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said . On March 18, 2024, lawmakers in The Gambia voted to overturn a nine-year ban on female genital mutilation (FGM) that has been in place since 2015. The legislators in the West African nation voted 42 to four to advance a controversial bill which would repeal the landmark 2015 ban on FGM that made the practice punishable by up to three years in prison. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined female genital mutilation /cutting as all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. Reacting to the steps taken to lift the ban on FGM, a Muslim scholar and preacher in The Gambia, Imam Abdoulie Fatty, said the practice has no health implications to warrant a ban. What people are saying about Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is not true. One Dr Jack Faal, who is a medical Doctor, once said all what people are saying about FGM is not true. During the process of cutting, the blood that the victim loses is very small and cannot cause any health implications. If a woman is circumcised, she recovers very fast when compared to other bodily wounds. Surgery kills and is still killing people, he said in the Hausa dialect during an interview posted on Facebook, starting from minute 0.20 to 01.20. He continued , What we normally cut during female circumcision is very small. FGM is not only our culture, but its part of our Islamic religion. They want us to abandon the Holy Book of Allah and the Sunnah of his Prophet to accept the wishes of only a few peoples decisions. As of today, we say no to the wishes of these few people and will follow the Sunnah of the Prophet and whatever you want to do, go ahead. DUBAWA decided to fact-check the imams assertion because of the interest it has generated in the West African country and for public health safety. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that there are no health benefits for persons who undergo female genital mutilation. On the contrary, the procedure can lead to immediate health risks. All forms of FGM are associated with increased health risk in the short- and long-term. FGM is a harmful practice and is unacceptable from a human rights as well as a public health perspective, regardless of who performs it, the WHO said . Some of the health risks associated with FGM are severe pain, excessive bleeding (haemorrhage), shock, genital tissue swelling, infections, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), urination problems, impaired wound healing, mental problems and in certain cases, death. Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of America noted that although FGM is seen as part of the culture of certain countries where it is practised, it has no health benefits. In fact, it can lead to immediate and long-term health problems that can affect obstetric, gynaecological, sexual, and psychological health, Americas foremost health authority said. According to a report by Mayo Clinic, the health complications of FGM can be categorised into early and late complications. Frequently seen early complications include bleeding, infection, and urinary retention. In general, fewer immediate complications are seen with type 1 FGC, with bleeding and urinary retention still occurring at low rates, the report reads (see page 623). The report further noted that the common late complications from FGM can be organised by the type of symptom, with most falling into categories of urinary complications, scarring, pain, infection, infertility, and sexual dysfunction. Similarly, a report authored by a senior lecturer at the School of Nursing and a researcher at the Africa Coordinating Centre for the Abandonment of Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (ACCAF), Dr Samuel Kimani, revealed the practice has serious health consequences for girls and women. The report titled, Health impacts of female genital mutilation/cutting: a synthesis of the evidence revealed that, The health impacts associated with FGM/C that require interventions have been broadly categorised into immediate, genito-urinary, gynaecological, obstetric, sexual and psycho-social consequences. See paragraph 3 of page iv of the report. The cutting of womens and girls clitoris and labia is usually done with crude unsterile instruments and without anaesthesia by traditional practitioners who have little knowledge of female anatomythe cutting results in immediate harm. Bleeding (haemorrhage) occurs due to laceration or severing of branches of the pudendal or clitoral arteries, which have high blood pressure, causing a strong flow of blood during and shortly after the cutting process, the report said. See paragraph 2 of page 5 of the report. DUBAWA contacted a human rights activist in The Gambia, Fatou Suna, who said female genital mutilation is a human rights violation and has a lot of health issues. Over the past few months, I joined a team that went out to different communities and engaged women and girls on this FGM issue, but even those who were conducting it testified that the practice is harmful, she said. The Communications Officer for Catch Them Young, a human rights group in The Gambia, told DUBAWA: We will continue with the advocacy until we get what we want. We want to make sure that the practice is eradicated in The Gambia and beyond. FGM kills slowly, she said. Based on various research reports authored by reputable health organisations and experts, it is therefore not true that Female Genetic Mutilation (FGM) has no health implications as alleged by the Islamic scholar Imam Abdoulie Fatty.",1
"CLAIM: Nnamdi Kanu has been released from DSS custody. VERDICT: False. A recent tweet by the legal counsel to IPOB implies that the separatist leader is still in the custody of the states secret police. Meanwhile, news outlets report the pleas made by state players for Mr Kanus release. The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has continued to be remanded in a holding facility of the Defense State Security (DSS) despite the appellate courts order to release him . The embattled IPOB leader had witnessed eight of the 15 counts against him dropped in April 2022, and the remaining seven also struck out in Oct. 2022. However, Mr Kanu is yet to be released by the state secret police. Amidst the development, a Facebook user identified as Billionaire Blogger posted a video where a lady and man stated that the IPOB leader had finally been released. God is wonderful. Them don release Nnamdi Kanu. Them don release Nnamdi Kanu, the lady jubilated. Domiciled in France, according to the video, she hailed the IPOB leader and congratulated him. She further declared that the IPOB leader will emerge as the next president of Nigeria. The lady also requested other Facebook users who would come across the video to share it around. Her male counterpart, who appeared on the video after she had ended her appeal, also reiterated the claim that Mr Kanu has been released. He stated that the court had ordered the release of the IPOB leader because Mr Kanus arrest breached territorial laws since he enjoyed dual citizenship. It is very wrong for a country to breach territorial integrity by going into another country to arrest a man who is a dual citizen, he said. He further stated that he viewed the governments decision to release the IPOB leader as bait to lure Mr Kanu to incite either ethnic or political insurrection. He reclined his belief against the backdrop of the 1914 amalgamation that was signed to bind the southern protectorate, the northern protectorate and the colony together as an independent state. He spoke of an agreement that was made during the amalgamation to go back from it if the needed peace and harmony were not achieved after 100 years. According to him, that time elapsed in 2014. As a result, any party is at liberty to walk out of the pact to the former status quo without defaulting on any legal obligation related to the agreement. He added that due to the discovery of oil in the lands of the southern part of the country, the authorities have refused the legitimacy for any perceived secession, declaring there is peace in the country. He said Mr Kanu only tried to spotlight the countrys lack of peace and harmony. Although they arrested him, the separatist leader has now been released. Already, the post has generated 23,000 likes, over 6,000 comments, and 835,000 views as of Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023. Most of those in the comment section only found the video incredibly true and were quick to text in their congratulations. Congratulations to you, sir. Double Clear1 commented . A big congratulations to the hero of our time. Nancy Ndubisi wrote . However, we were not ready to take the news at face value, so we verified its authenticity. A keyword search enabled us to locate a Daily Post report dated Thursday, Oct 19, 2023. The report amplifies a social media text message by Mr Kanus special counsel, Aloy Ejimakor. The paper reports that Mr Ejimakor perceived his principals arrest and subsequent detention by former president Muhammadu Buhari as ethnically motivated and unlawful. Daily Post indicated that the legal practitioner had written the message on X (formerly Twitter) and further tagged the handle of the president, President Bola Tinubu, not to do the same as his predecessor had done. Consequently, we looked up the post on X and found it . Buharis detention of MAZI NNAMDI KANU was not based on law but on the politics of tribalism that has dogged Nigeria since time. Tinubu (@officialABAT) shouldnt validate it. #FreeMNK, part of the message reads. We noticed the hashtag #FreeMNK, which only seems to suggest that the IPOB leader is still in detention and has not been released yet. In another development, the ImoState governor, Uche Nwosu, made a plea to release Mr Kanu. Mr Nwosu was appealing to the president, President Bola Tinubu, to release Mr Kanu ahead of the gubernatorial election in Imo State for peace to reign in the state. A Guardian newspaper report also tells of the decision of the supreme socio-cultural group in the southeast, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, to seek the release of Mr Kanu by the end of the year. The paper further reports that the indigenous group beckoned on all its Biafran supporters to abstain from exercising any aggressive action for 40 days, beginning from October 31, 2023. The announcement was said to have been made by the groups Secretary-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro. The claim is false. No public or material evidence suggests that Mr Kanu has been released from detention. Rather, available information only shows that the IPOB leader is still in the custody of the secret police.",0
"Claim: An X user, via a video post, claims that there are recent plans to Islamise Nigeria. Verdict: Misleading! Evidence from credible media outlets shows that the Islamic support for Mr Tinubu happened in 2023 before he became Nigerias president. The 2023 election that brought President Tinubu to power was marred by controversy following the Islamic religious affiliation of the two representatives of the All Progressive Congress (APC). This development sparked criticism from Christian unions and Nigerians who perceive the coalition as a negative and unfavourable representation at the federal level. On Wednesday, Oct. 30, 2024, an X user, @JPChidiOkoye1 , shared a video showing a man speaking about the Muslim-Muslim ticket. In the video, many Islamic clerics can be seen in attendance. Evil agenda to Islamize Nigeria is still ongoing, this user wrote. Available data on the post shows that as of Saturday, Nov. 9, 2024, the footage has amassed about 15,000 views, 113 likes, 21 comments, and 52 reposts. Going through the posts comment section, we noticed that many commenters believed the post. Lets celebrate Muslim-Muslim tickets until we all have no country call(ed) Nigeria. Could U just imagine the rubbish! @Nakson147 asserted. Another user, @fido1hn , satirically wrote, Them never get light for one week now. Na their Muslim-Muslim ticket go kpai them all. Meanwhile, @tv_wakawak expressed, These people are a curse! Anywhere you find them! The agender is (the) same! Death and destruction. DUBAWA decided to verify the videos recency and authenticity, given the posts contentious nature and potential to incite religious and political rife. DUBAWA analysed keyframes from the posted video using Google Reverse Image Search. The result led us to similar videos posted on X ( here and here ) in 2023. Further investigation also led to the original video posted on Facebook on Jan. 6, 2023. The video was the same as the one posted by the claimant but with a different audio. In this particular video, the man spoke in Hausa. The Facebook caption reads, History will not repeat itself, and there will be no annulment this time around (referring to the Muslim/ Muslim ticket of APC). Dr Abdullmudalib Muhammad, the Convener of the meeting, then stated the purpose of the meeting, part of the post reads. The participants are Muslims and Islamic clerics. We gathered Muslims from all persuasions to enlighten them on ensuring that the Muslim/ Muslim ticket succeeds. We invited over 75 Islamic groups from several states, including Yoruba and Igbo Muslims. We told the Islamic clerics /participants that the issue is not about building infrastructure for the nation, but the major issue is who will promote Islam. We told the participants that a Muslim, wherever he is, is better than a kafiri (unbeliever) non-Muslim he wrote further. To understand the context of the 2023 video, we performed a keyword search, which directed us to several reports published in January 2023. Republican News published a report on Jan. 7, 2023, of a prayer session organised by Muslim clerics in the Northwest to support President Tinubu ahead of the 2023 general election. The report further explained that a Nigerian Islamic preacher, Abdulmutallab Mohammed, emphasised the importance of supporting President Tinubu, describing the APCs Muslim-Muslim ticket as not just the supremacy of Islam but a call to Jihad. Daily Post and Head Topics also reported a similar development. Furthermore, we observed that the video discussion centred on the 2023 election, and Tinubu had yet to be declared Nigerias president then. DUBAWAs findings show that the video is not recent, as it has been online since 2023. Therefore, the claim is misleading.",0
"CLAIM: A video shared by Facebook user @ONYII NWA IMO claimed that Imo voters have resorted to staying indoors as only a few people are at different polling units in Owerri, the state capital. FINDING: Tunde Ososanya , a BBC Reporter covering the election in Imo, in a telephone conversation, confirmed that the incident of low voter turnout in Owerri and other parts of Imo State is true.

"This is Nigerian former football player, Wilson Oruma. In life, always try to be good to others and avoid taking advantage of others for you don't know what the future holds, reads the caption to an image circulating on Facebook. Wilson Oruma is a retired Nigerian footballer. He played for Nigeria at the 2002 and 2006 Africa Cup of Nations , where the team finished third both times. He was also part of the team that won gold in football at the 1996 summer Olympic games, a year after making his international debut. The image circulating on social media shows two photos side by side. On the left is Oruma and on the right a man, seen from the back, who appears to be wearing only a ragged loincloth. According to the posts, the photo on the left shows the football star in 2016 and the other shows him in 2024. The posts insinuate that Oruma is mentally ill. Similar posts can be found here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) But how true is this claim? We checked. Misleading photo A reverse image search revealed that the photo of Oruma, which the social media posts allege was taken in 2016, is in fact from the African Cup of Nations in 2006 when Nigeria played against Ghana. Oruma retired in 2010 after one season with Greek team Athletic Club Kavala . We also did a reverse image search of the image of the half-naked man. We found no instances of the image published anywhere, other than in the social media posts claiming the man is Oruma. While this doesnt prove the man is not Oruma, there is also no evidence that the image shows the true state of the footballer in 2024. In 2023, Oruma denied claims that he was mentally ill, saying he was fine. The fact-checking organisation Dubawa has also debunked the posts, calling them false and misleading. Similar posts about the state of the Wilson in 2024 can be found here , here , here , here and here .",0
"Claim : A Facebook user claims that the South African singer Tyla was forced to cancel her planned world tour due to low ticket sales. Verdict : False. Checks by DUBAWA showed that the singer did not cancel her planned world tour due to low ticket sales, as alleged. Rather, the Grammy-award-winning singer had to cancel her tour due to health reasons. A Facebook user, who goes by the name Richard Kingsley (Dr) and introduces himself as an entertainment promoter with over 158 thousand followers, shared an image of South African singer Tyla in which he claimed the Water hitmaker had cancelled her planned world tour due to low ticket sales. Tyla just cancelled her whole tour due to low ticket sales. One hit is never enough. No matter how big the record is, he wrote on Facebook on March 7, 2024, as curated using Wayback Machine. The social media platform records showed the post had 8,234 comments, over 2,345 shares and over 80,342 likes. DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim as part of its campaign against misinformation and disinformation in The Gambia. Checks by DUBAWA showed that the South African singer Tyla did not cancel her planned world tour due to low ticket sales, as alleged. Rather, the Grammy award-winning singer cancelled her tour due to health reasons. In consulting with medical professionals, its become increasingly clear that continuing any festival or tour dates would jeopardise my long-term health and safety, her statement on Instagram on March 7, 2024, reads in part . She explained , As much as this is something I would rather have dealt with privately, its important that I share what I have to share with you today. For the past year, Ive been silently suffering from an injury that has tragically worsened. Ive seen doctors and specialists with high hopes, but the pain has only become more agonising, as has the severity of the situation. The South African singer promised that her team is diligently working on a spectacular show for you as soon as I am recovered and ready to return safely onstage this summer. The cancellation of the planned world tour comes nearly two months after the singer won a Grammy in the category of Best African Music Performance for her Afropiano and R&B song Water, which has reached global popularity. A Google keyword search conducted by DUBAWA showed that all the reputable media organisations that reported about the cancelled tour cited the singers injury, not the low ticket sales, as alleged. Referencing the singers Instagram post, French channel France24 reported on March 8, 2024, that: The rising music star, who gained international fame last year [2023] with hit single Water, said she was heartbroken after doctors advised her against proceeding with the tour. Also, a South African online news portal reported on March 13, 2024, that: The South African singer known for her hit song Water, Tyla, has cancelled her upcoming tour in North America due to a health concern. DUBAWA later contacted the Facebook user to discover where he got the claim from; however, as of this publication, he has not responded to the inquiry. Therefore, it is not true that South African Grammy award-winning singer Tyla cancelled her planned North American tour because of low ticket sales. The singer has said that she cancelled the world tour because of health concerns.",1
"Claim: A Twitter user claims youth in Adamawa State burnt brooms to show their support for Atiku Abubakar. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken during Bugum Chugu, a fire festival that takes place in Ghana. It is neither related to Nigeria, nor has anything to do with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate. As the 2023 presidential election draws near, the Nigerian social media landscape has been awash with discussions around the major contending candidates. Recently, some social media users began to circulate a TikTok video suggesting that the youths of Adamawa State are out to show their support for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar. Millions of youths burning brooms in Adamawa after receiving Atiku yesterday, well, this is just the beginning. 2023 is going to be mad. #AtikuKawai, one of the tweets reads. The video shows a crowd, matching on the street with fire sticks in their hands as loud music blasts in the background. The video has confused social media users. While some believed it was Adamawa youth burning brooms in support of the PDP presidential candidate, others claimed that the video was from Ghana. Therefore, DUBAWA opted to verify the accuracy of the video. After close observation of the video, DUBAWA found two overlapping usernames. Although blurry, they were two different user identities. TikTok is known for automatically attaching its users names to their videos. However, the original version of a TikTok video is not supposed to have more than one username, indicating a form of manipulation on the video. When DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on TikTok, similar videos shared by other users were uncovered. The earliest version of the footage revealed it was taken during a Ghanaian festival that took place on the 9th of August, 2022. This is contrary to the circulating version. In the original version, emphasis was the cheers of the crowd in the background and not music. Also, the people were waving a bunch of thatch lighted with fire and not brooms as claimed. The Bugum Chugu Fire Festival is an annual event that takes place in the Northern region of Ghana. The occasion is marked by the lighting of thatch torches, matching along approved routes, chanting war songs. The event is marked to celebrate the beginning of a new year in the traditional month of Bugum Gri, known among the Dagomba people as im. According to legend , the people upheld this event many years ago, after a missing son of their king was found asleep under a tree. Our discovery shows that the circulating video emanated from an annual fire festival that took place in the Northern region of Ghana. It is not related to Nigeria or the PDP presidential candidate. The claim accompanying the video is false.",1
"Claim : A Facebook blog, Born 2 Blog, claimed that Mohamed Kallon, the head coach of the Sierra Leone national football team, deliberately dropped East End Lions goalkeeper, Dauda Bangura, in favour of FC Kallons Isaac Caulker ahead of a world cup qualifier. Verdict : The claim is false. According to the official list of players selected by head coach Mohamed Kallon, which was published by the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) Media and Marketing Department, Dauda Bangura of East End Lions is included in the squad. A Facebook post by Born 2 Blog has gone viral. It claims that Mohamed Kallon, the newly appointed national team head coach, left out Dauda Bangura, the in-form East End Lions goalkeeper. The post suggests that Kallon deliberately chose Isaac Caulker of FC Kallon instead. Dauda Bangura has been one of the best-performing goalkeepers in the 2024/2025 Leone Rock Premier League. He has kept eleven clean sheets, the highest in the league so far, and has won two Man of the Match awards. Meanwhile, Isaac Caulker of FC Kallon has made only three appearances this season. The post reads: Breaking News! Mohamed Kallon has deliberately dropped in-form East End Lions goalkeeper Dauda Bangura for FC Kallons Isaac Caulker. Dauda has kept eleven clean sheets, the highest of any goalkeeper in the league so far, and two Man of the Match awards, while Isaac Caulker has only played three games for FC Kallon this season. This biased selection raises serious concerns about Mohamed Kallons ability to resolve the long-standing favouritism in player selection for the national team. We are closely watching. This post has sparked strong reactions from football fans across Sierra Leone. Many supporters have questioned the fairness of the selection process and the transparency of Mohamed Kallons decisions. Given the potential for misinformation, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA contacted Jonathan Turner, an SLFA Media and Marketing Department member. He confirmed that the claim of Born 2 Blog is false. Turner stated that Dauda Bangura is part of the national team squad selected by head coach Mohamed Kallon. His name appears third on the official list published by SLFA. Turner added that Isaac Caulker did not replace Bangura. He assured football fans that the selection process was based on performance and merit and that all the players chosen were considered the best for the national team at the time. The claim by Born 2 Blog that Mohamed Kallon dropped Dauda Bangura from the national team in favour of Isaac Caulker is false. Official records from the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) confirm that Bangura has been selected for the squad.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user posted a clip of a man who transformed himself into a dog with $14,000. Verdict : The claim is misleading. Findings revealed that Toco, a Japanese man involved, was cladded in a hyper-realistic costume, which he purchased for over $15,000. EmmyG , a Facebook user, recently shared a clip with an assertion that a man who has transformed himself into a dog with $14,000 was stepping out for his first walk in public. In the forty-four seconds video , an unnamed woman was seen taking a video pose with the dog amidst passersby. Since posted on July 29, 2023, this claim has attracted 1.3 million views, 18,000 likes, 4,900 shares and 4,800 contrasting comments. Body modification may no longer be news across the globe. However, that a human being could completely transform himself into an animal was what pricked the interest of other users like Michael Egbayelo , who expressly doubted the claims truthfulness. In the comment section, he said, This story cant be true. No technology in this world can reduce the height of a man unless by amputation. So how will a man reduce to the height of a dog? Like Mr Egbayelo, another user, Emmanuel Austin Emeka , said that he would not accept the story as truthful. I dont believe that story, this is just another breed of dog. We cant believe all stories in social media, he typed. Recognising the claims sensitive nature and the potential danger of misinformation it carries, DUBAWA opted to verify its accuracy. After carefully examining the video, DUBAWA noticed some behaviours that are not typical of a dog. For instance, this particular one leapt while lying on the ground rather than walking upright. Aside from that, it neither gave a facial movement nor opened its mouth even though it rolled on the floor at the beckon of the woman with it. Following these first sets of red flags, we probed further by conducting a keyword search on Google. This led our findings to several articles about a certain Toco, a Japanese man who went viral in 2022 after buying a dog costume with over $15,000 in a bid to appear as an animal. According to Mirror , a UK-based news platform, he spent about two million Yen, equivalent to 12,480, to look exactly like his favourite breed of canine. Said to be his lifelong dream, Toco bought a realistic border collie costume from Zeppet, a Japanese agency known for creating sculptures and models for movies. A similar story was reported here , here and here . It was also said that he owns a 51.6k subscribers YouTube channel , which he named I want to be an animal. In its description, he wrote, I wanted to be an animal, so I became a rough collie! This channel will bring you videos of such an unusual rough collie. Toco uploaded his first video wearing the dog suit on April 12, 2022. So far, he has posted 37 videos of himself wearing this costume. His latest upload, Dogs and peoples reactions to seeing a realistic dog costume! made him go viral again. Presently, it already has over 6 million views. According to reports, Toco is a Japanese man who dreamed of becoming an animal. Although he now looks like one, he has only achieved his goal by purchasing a costume resembling a dog. The claim that a man has transformed himself into a dog is, therefore, misleading.",1
"Claim: A Facebook account recently shared footage showing a crowd in a desert, implying the people in the crowd were Nigerians seeking a better life in a foreign land. Verdict: The footage is misleading. It originates from an older clip depicting a deportation incident of several Africans from Algeria and Libya to Assamaka, Niger. Japa is a Yoruba slang term from Nigerian Pidgin English that means to flee or escape. It is often used to refer to emigrating or leaving a difficult situation in search of better opportunities. It has gained popularity recently, particularly among young Nigerians looking to move abroad for better economic prospects. The concept has driven many Nigerians to seek better opportunities abroad, influencing career choices and increasing emigration. Young professionals, students, and families are pursuing in-demand international IT, healthcare, and engineering careers. This trend has led to significant investments in skills, education, and financial planning for emigration-related expenses while boosting remittances supporting families back home. Social media success stories amplify the Japa phenomenon, creating urgency and dissatisfaction about Nigerias socio-economic conditions. Amid this lingering desire, a Facebook platform titled Progressive Nigerian Politics recently shared a video of a group of people who can be seen walking across an open field that resembles a desert, though its only a plain, sandy area. Some people in the crowd are carrying bags, while others walk empty-handed. Nigerian music plays in the background, and as the camera rotates, it captures different angles of the crowd moving, with happy expressions on some faces. The 58-second video was shared on June 17, 2024, at about 9:48 PM. The caption that follows the video reads: Jakpa: Some Nigerians seen travelling through the desert for greener pasture. Many users affirmed the authenticity of this claim. Cyril Orji commented: Please when the next batch is going, someone should contact me oooo! With the way Nigeria is going now, in the next 3 years, humans will eat fellow humans as food. Ikechukwu Anaba added: Strangely, some of them voted for this present government. But after shege pro max of 1 year, they want to run. I wish such people would be repatriated back to Naija to complete their tenure of the fallen mandate. In a tone of empathy, Shepuya Mamman Kozah said: Lord, please protect them. When viewed, the post had 1,100,000 views, 7,500 comments, 22,300 likes, and 10,200 shares. Weighing the likelihood of the false claim, DUBAWA verified it, particularly because of its virality. DUBAWA subjected a screenshot from the footage to a Google Lens search. The results revealed many such claims posted across various platforms. See some here , here , and here . Nevertheless, this led DUBAWA to the same video on YouTube that we shared a year ago. The caption, written in French, translated to The border between Algeria and Niger. The earlier video lacked the recent versions audio and featured indistinct chatter from moving people. DUBAWA conducted further searches and discovered a report with images matching those in the earlier video used for the claim. Published in March 2022 by Alarme Phone Sahara whistleblowers in Assamaka, the report detailed how people in the desert were unofficially deported from Algeria on January 23, February 7, and March 8, 2022. According to the report, in January 2022, 754 deportees arrived on foot in Assamaka, a small desert town in Niger. Among them were women and three minor boys. The largest groups of deportees were 219 Malians and 244 Guineans. The remaining deportees included 97 nationals from Sudan, 21 from Senegal, 31 from Burkina Faso, 32 from Ivory Coast, and 18 from Sierra Leone. Others are 17 from Cameroon, 20 from Benin, 13 from the Gambia, 17 from Nigeria, eight from Chad, three from Niger itself, three from Ethiopia, two from Liberia, four from the Central African Republic, four from Eritrea, and one Syrian. The report also noted that the unofficial convoys were abandoned at Point Zero, a border area between Algeria and Niger in the middle of the desert. Deportees were left to walk 15 to 20 kilometres through the desert to reach Assamaka, the first Nigerien town after the Algerian border. DUBAWA checked for reports from reputable Nigerian media regarding this recently claimed post but found none. Results from DUBAWAs investigation indicate that the recent clip alleging Nigerians are leaving the country through a desert is false. Instead, the evidence points to an old incident involving deportees travelling to Niger. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Prime Progress, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user claims Tamba Boakai, a son of Liberian President Joseph Boakai has imported a new breed of hard drug known as Zombie into Liberia. Verdict: False. Checks by DUBAWA showed that there is no evidence to support the claim that Mr Boakais son, Tamba Boakai, has been involved in the importation of any zombie drug. Also, the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency has described the claim as fake. A Facebook account, The Daily News, which claims to be a media/news company alleged that Tamba Boakai, the Liberian President Joseph Boakais son, has imported a new hard drug known as Zombie into Liberia. Writing on Facebook on May 6, 2024, the Facebook user said : Breaking news! A huge quantity of a new breed of drug in Liberia known as Zombie was brought into the country over the weekend by the son of President Tamba Boakai who goes by the stage name Tan Tan. The writer added: Our source said that Zombie drugs [are more] dangerous than Kush. We need to start praying for our brothers and sisters. Tamba Boakai is a musician and songwriter in Liberia known as Tan Tan. DUBAWAs checks have shown that the claim surfaced following an online news report about the discovery of a new illicit drug in Liberia . Another Facebook user, Moses Thomas , who reacted to the post said: Wow, the drug war [has] started in Liberia again. Oh God please protect our innocent nation mama Liberia from destruction and bad leaders. For Emmanuel Suah who also reacted to the post, he wrote: When you are invited by LDEA to provide evidence you go there [and] dont say it is a witch hunt. DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claims authenticity as part of its campaign against misinformation and disinformation in Liberia. So what is the Zombie Drug? This term is used to describe several illegal drugs, such as Tranq, Flakka, and Xylazine. These drugs can lead to zombie-like behaviours and have unpredictable effects on users mental and physical health. The researcher first proceeded to the Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA) in an attempt to gather evidence but the Communication Director of the Agency, Michael Jipply, told DUBAWA that there was no truth in the allegation. It is not true, at no point in time was Tan Tan involved in the smuggling or trafficking of any drug, the Communication Director at the LDEA, Michael Jipply said when contacted. Mr Jipply also disputed reports that the Zombie drug is in circulation across the country. We cant find it in our local drug market, you will either see it at the zoo or a forest park, where it is used to calm down wild animals, he told DUBAWA. In addition, when DUBAWA reached out to Tamba Boakai on WhatsApp to get his reaction to the claim, he described it as fake. Also, a Google keyword search conducted by DUBAWA showed no reputable media organisation publishing news reports about the purported importation of the Zombie drug by Tamba Boakai. Considering the political climate in Liberia, the claim would have made headlines in the country if it were true. However, no such data is available online. DUBAWA later contacted the Facebook user with the findings of its investigation; however, as of May 23, 2024, the claimant has yet to respond to the inquiry about the source of the claim.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message titled, Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In the Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled was purported to have been written by former Nigeria President, Olusegun Obasanjo. The message is misleading. Obasanjo is not the author of this message. The Nigerian social media space has been used several times to share fake news, incite violence and create fear in the minds of people. This is despite the limitless good opportunities it offers the teeming population. Recently, stories regarding herders-farmers clash in southern Nigerian communities have become commonplace in the news media and on social media platforms. In view of this and other security threats, some Nigerians have called on the government to allow citizens to carry AK-47 rifles due to the security challenges faced in most parts of the country. Narratives regarding the Islamisation and Fulanization of Nigeria by the Buhari administration have also gained prominence in social debates and discussions. Also, multimedia files projecting these fears are being shared regularly. However, in a bid to further push this kind of narrative, a message was put together and attributed to former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo. The message has been shared several times on WhatsApp. Obasanjo, who ruled as both military Head of State and civilian president, is one who had taken his time to write letters to past and current presidents of the country showing concerns over the state of the nation while proffering possible solutions to the problems. An example is one written to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan in December 2013 titled Before it is too late. He also wrote another to Buhari in 2018 advising him to take a rest from politics. It was titled, The Way Out: A Clarion Call For Coalition For Nigeria Movement. Obasanjo has also presented himself as a strong advocate for a better Nigeria through constant interviews in the media expressing his opinion on the state of the nation. Beyond WhatsApp groups, the message has also been shared to other social media platforms such as Facebook and some other popular websites. Part of the message reads, Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled Olusegun Obasanjo Another civil war in Nigeria has become imminent and inevitable. The reason for its inevitability is simply because Muhammadu Buhari, the Northern Nigeria Fulani oligarchs and the wider network of Fulani in Sub-Saharan Africa have concluded plans to adopt Nigeria as the homeland for all Fulani in Africa. Fulani have realised that the wandering and rootless lifestyle of cattle herding is no longer tenable in the twenty-first century. Fulani need to have land to call home and rear cattle and that land should be Nigeria. The indigenous peoples of Nigeria have clearly, vehemently and stridently opposed this diabolic plan and both sides are mobilising for war. The Fulani wont relent and the indigenous people will not give up their land. The same Fulani Project, having failed so shamelessly and woefully in the Central African Republic, will not be allowed to fail this time as the Nigerian Fulani project is better funded with the massive [stealing] of the sovereign wealth of Nigeria through nationwide kidnapping for ransom by lower class Fulani and the seizure of the reigns of Government and wealth by the elite Fulani. Kidnapping and the seizure of the institutions of Government are all for the purpose of implanting Fulani into the mainstream and control of politics and the economy of Nigeria for the objective of funding the Fulani Project in Nigeria. The message also quoted Obasanjo as saying that Central African Republic had gone through the same Fulani invasion of farmlands and communities currently being experienced in Nigeria, urging Nigerians to rise up and defend their lands. Dubawa read the 20 paragraph-long message which sought to inform Nigerians on plans by Buhari to take their lands for Fulanis, how the herdsmen invasion was tackled in the CAR and what Nigerians can possibly do to curtail herdsmen invasion. The message also cited the alleged instances wherein Buhari showed a favourable disposition towards the Fulanis. Dubawa reached out to Obasanjos Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Akinyemi, who dismissed the viral message, noting that there is no basis to believe. Akinyemi noted that Obasanjos standard mode of communication have been made public over time, urging readers to look out for the date of the message, and if it had been duly acknowledged by him. He said, In the last four, five years, we have been saying how this man sends out communication. Before anyone will believe this, it is either coming from his office dated and duly acknowledged by him, not just Olusegun Obasanjo as his name appears in the message. Further checks by Dubawa showed that there was no such report in credible news outlets. This message is misleading and false. Obasanjo did not author the viral WhatsApp message titled, Fulanis In Nigeria Are Repeating What They Did In Central African Republic And How They Were Tackled.

"Claim: A Facebook post claims BB-905 aircraft is a locally made fighter Jet made by Biafra many years ago. The image alleged to be a locally manufactured fighter Jet by Biafra is false. All investigations show the aircraft used during the war was purchased and the aircraft looks nothing like the BB-905 in the claim. Biafra or the Republic of Biafra was a secessionist state that existed from May 1967 to January 1970 during the Nigerian Civil War. Its territory consisted of the Eastern Region of Nigeria In 1967 , following two coups and turmoil which led to about a million Igbos returning to the southeast of Nigeria, the Republic of Biafra seceded with 33-year-old military officer Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu at the helm. The Nigerian government declared war and after 30 months of fighting, Biafra surrendered. On 15 January 1970, the conflict officially ended. On Monday April 19, 2021, a Facebook post by Tariere Fiebai was shared by another Facebook user, Choji Tosanwumi Pwoi. The post had 8 reactions, 9 comments and 2 shares. According to this post accompanied by the picture of a Jet, this Jet was 100% manufactured by Biafrans in 1968. This Jet was manufactured 100% by the Biafrans in 1968. If you dont tell your storyanother will with versions that suit him. Excerpt of claim from Facebook . A comment under this post by Micheal Dedon disagreed with this, questioning the authors knowledge of what a jet looks like. He also added this was a sky wagon made in the United States (US) and Canada. Madam, check the background well and study the serial number and flag on the plane. Does the environment look local to you? That is a variant of the Cessna 185 Skywagon made in the US and Canada. Excerpt of Dedons comment. Another user in the comment section also questioned the authors knowledge of a jet. Dubawa, having observed the aircraft in the picture does not look like a Jet, conducted a keyword search on Jets and its characteristics. A Jet is one of the most common types of air plane s in use today, having largely replaced traditional aircraft powered by propellers. Although propeller planes still exist, Jets dominate commercial and private air travel owing to their greater speed, ability to fly at higher altitudes and mechanical reliability. Jets consist of five major parts ; the fuselage, wings and stabilizers, engines, landing gear, and the cockpit. Also, a Google reverse image search on the image showed the aircraft in the image was the Cessna 185 Skywagon, not a Jet. This is a six-seat , single-engined light aircraft manufactured by Cessna. The reverse image search led to other posts on Facebook and Twitter where the image had been used. A Facebook post by NKANU TV shared by Mhista Sampuwa Samuel claims this is a Biafran BB- 905 locally manufactured fighter jet used during the civil war. This post was shared on the same date (April 19) that Fiebai shared his post. Biafra BB-905 Locally Manufactured Fighter Jet Used During The 1967-1970 Biafra-Nigeria Civil War. Excerpt of NKANU TV Facebook post. The above post by NKANU TV was also shared by I ndeginouse Modelling and Entertainment Agency . A Twitter user Olaudah Equiano @RealOlaudah also shared the same image with a similar caption and #NigerianHistory. This Tweet also made on April 19 had 848 retweets, 37 quote retweets, and 2,313 likes. Dubawa also conducted a keyword search to find if Jets were used during the Biafran war. We found a Biafran Air Force B26 aircraft which looked nothing like the aircraft in the viral image. This search also led to some images on Pinterest similar to the image above. Pinterest also described it as the Biafran Air Force B26 aircraft. Another result showed pictures of aircraft for Biafra (Biafran Invaders) although there were different stories to explain this. The pictures in this article also do not look like the one that has gone viral and it was noted that the aircraft was purchased not made. If this aircraft is not for Biafra, then where is it from? To answer this, Dubawa conducted another search using the number (BB-905) on the aircraft in the image to find its origin. We found from the United States Department of Transportation that this aircraft was from the United States and was manufactured in 1981 many years after the Biafran war. Screenshot of aircraft details on FAA registry. Similar information was found on the Dutch Aviation Societys website. This showed this type of aircraft were produced at different times from 1981 down to 2019. This further proves there is no way this could have existed in 1967 during the Biafran war. The image alleged to be a locally manufactured fighter Jet by Biafra is false. All investigations show the aircraft used during the war was purchased and the aircraft looks nothing like the BB-905 in the claim.",0
"Claim: Onion can be used to grow hair for bald people. Verdict: MISLEADING. Studies have shown that onions contain properties that can grow hair; however, more studies are needed to prove their effectiveness in curing baldness. An onion , also known as the bulb onion or common onion, is the most widely cultivated species of the genus Allium. Its close relatives include garlic, scallion, leek, and chive. Onions are also known to have many benefits for the human body, apart from cooking, they can also be used as oils, for education purposes, and dyes. @desola__xn on X posted that Onion juice can potentially help bald people. In the post, the writer directed users to grate the onion, extract the juice, and then massage it into their scalp. The comment section was flooded with plenty of people asking about the effectiveness of the onion juice, while others doubted the claim. Fobs (@ diction234 ), doubting the possibility of the claim, wrote, Doesnt work. Youll just stink for nothing Another X user Olamilekan ( @Olamispread12 ), wrote, Wow, thank you for this My bald head has been giving me concern. The claim was also posted on other social media accounts on Facebook here , here , and here . Since it was posted on March 30, 2024, the post garnered 286 comments, 840 retweets, 2,000 likes, and 2,700 bookmarks. Seeing the excitement about the claim in the comment section and the posts virality, we decided to investigate it. According to Healthline , onion juice may sometimes be effective for hair loss. It may also restore lustre and shine. Onion juice could also prevent premature greying of hair and treat dandruff. Onions are high in dietary sulfur, a nutritional element our bodies need. Sulfur is found within amino acids, which are protein components, especially keratin , which is known to be sulfur-rich and is needed for growing strong hair. When added to the hair and scalp, onion juice can provide extra sulfur to support strong and thick hair, thus preventing hair loss and promoting growth. The sulfur from onions may also help promote collagen production. A study conducted by Khalifa Sharquie and Hala Al-Obaidi examined the science of using onion juice to grow hair. The group that washed their hair with onion juice experienced more hair growth than those with tap water. Men also appeared to experience a greater benefit than women. Nevertheless, many more recent studies and reviews of natural hair loss treatments reference the study as reliable evidence that onion juice may be helpful. However, onion juice should not be considered a cure for hair loss conditions like alopecia or pattern baldness. While it is known to help stimulate and protect the growth of current hair, it is not known to reverse any hair loss-related illness. Adenike Iwuchukwu, a hair expert, explained how onion juice can be used for hair growth. She noted that the juice would also work as part of home treatments. Ms Iwuchukwu wrote that while the juice might work for hair growth, it may not be good for everyone because it can not be measured so it might be too concentrated on the scalp. She also advised people with onion allergies not to use the juice as it might have adverse effects on them. We also spoke to Daisy Obiano, a trichologist who noted that applying onions to hair can be repulsive because of their smell. She said that while onions can be said to grow bald heads, we need to know their effect on the follicles, and only extracting onion juice can not do that. Onion juice is a home treatment known for aiding hair growth, but it can not be proven scientifically. You must weigh the acidity or alkalinity, and the onion is acidic. You also have to consider the factors in formulation, such as the follicle enhancer, because one element is not enough to grow hair, she stated. Ms Obiano also explained that new hair cells take four to six weeks to grow, but onions can not be used to grow bald hair and alopecia. This has not been proven scientifically. She concluded by stating that she had not found any scientific research to prove that it could cure baldness. Therefore, she advised that people contact a professional trichologist for further medical advice. Although onion juice has been identified as a safe, natural, and affordable home remedy with significant health benefits, it is not a cure for pattern baldness, alopecia, or other hair loss-related disorders.",0
"A post circulating on Facebook in June 2023 claims that Nigerias Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) is sharing handouts containing questions and answers from previous recruitment exercises. The ICPCs mandate is to investigate, prosecute and prevent offences of corruption in Nigeria. The commission advertises recruitment drives on its careers page . The headline of the post reads: ICPC Past Questions And Answers . It claims these will help all shortlisted applicants to pass the commissions online test. Other versions of the claim appear here , here , here , here , here and here . Has the ICPC really made these questions and answers available to the public? We checked. The first red flag is that the link in the post does not take you to the official website of the ICPC , but to a basic-looking site with a number of pop-up adverts. From there, you can download a pdf file containing questions and answers. Those making use of the document are asked to contact a WhatsApp number if they find any missing pages. This is another red flag. It is unlikely that the ICPC would communicate with potential recruits in this way or publish documents with missing pages. On 14 June , the ICPC issued a disclaimer stating that it had nothing to do with the so-called past questions and answers. Members of the public should therefore ignore the online publication and report to the commission any person found involved in disseminating such fake information and extorting money from hapless applicants, the disclaimer reads .",0

"Claim: A Facebook user named Aguleri Culture & Music, Add Your Passion posted a video on August 1, 2024, alleging that a part of former Nigerian President Muhammadu Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, was set ablaze. Verdict: While there are reports that protesters surrounded Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, there is no concrete evidence that the house was burnt. Nigerians took to the streets across the country under the #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria movement, protesting against widespread corruption, poor governance, and the rising cost of living, which has left millions struggling to afford necessities. The protests, which began on August 1 and continued until August 10, saw demonstrators gather in various regions, including Kano, Katsina, and Yobe. In some of these areas, authorities imposed curfews in response to the violence that erupted, including the burning of vehicles and the destruction of property. Amid the unrest, numerous claims circulated on social media, including a video posted by the Facebook user Aguleri Culture & Music, Add Your Passion . The video was shared with a caption which claimed that a part of former President Muhammadu Buharis house in Daura, Katsina State, was burnt during the protests. The caption reads: A part of Buharis house in Daura is on fire, organised protest, set Buhari legacy on fire The video showed thick flames rising into the air while people gathered to watch as the fire intensified. Despite gaining attention, the video lacked comments and had around 100 views at the time of this report. Preliminary checks by DUBAWA revealed that the same video was later posted on X by user Nkirukamma (@SabinaNkiru) on August 10, 2024. The caption accompanying the post read: UNCONFIRMED! Buharis house is said to have been set ablaze in Daura, Katsina State. If this is true, then the North is no longer as we know it. The post attracted over 121,000 views, 124 reposts, and 16 replies. Some social media users sceptically questioned the claim. For instance, Anioma Ronu (@ChiduObodo) commented , The other time it was Tinubus house, now its Buharis house. Why are you so madly in love with fake news like this? Another user, Okechukwu Anozie (@elgedox), questioned the authenticity of the claim, asking , Pls, is this true? DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on several keyframes from the video and confirmed that the footage was indeed taken in Katsina State during the protest. The video went viral on the day of the protest. However, further investigation revealed that while several reputable media organisations, including Punch Newspapers and Channels TV , reported that protesters had invaded Buharis house in Daura, no reports indicated that any part of the house was set ablaze. According to Channels TV , the protesters barricaded major roads leading to Maiadua-Kwangwalam and Daura, including the T-junction leading to Buharis residence. The station also noted that the protesting youths eventually submitted a grievance letter to one of the former presidents aides for delivery to Buhari. Additionally, the report revealed a heavy security presence around the former presidents house during the protest, and the Katsina State Government imposed a curfew across all 34 Local Government Areas to maintain law and order. Despite the widespread discussions online, no credible sources or authorities have confirmed the claim that Buharis house was set on fire. While it is true that protesters gathered near the residence, reports of the home being burnt remain unverified.

"Claim: An X user claims Manchester United has offered Pogba a 50k weekly wage, including bonuses, in a short-term deal. Verdict: False. No reliable news outlets or Manchester United have confirmed the claimants alleged development. Besides, recent reports linked to the former French player have only speculated that he could play in MLS in the United States before joining any top-flight European outfit later in the summer. The 2018 World Cup winner Paul Pogba is expected to have fully served his two-year football ban by March 2025 after he was found guilty of taking dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in 2023. The Frenchman was initially handed a four-year suspension, but it was reduced by half after a partially successful appeal in November 2024. Consequently, he is free to join any club of interest after mutually terminating the contract with the Italian side, Juventus , on Nov. 30, 2024. Against this backdrop, an X user, Manutd Addicts ( @Manutd_addicts ), claimed that Premier League side Manchester United had offered the former Juventus and United midfielder a new contract in a short-term deal that includes a 50000 weekly salary and other add-ons. BREAKING: Manchester offer Pogba short term deal worth 50k a week plus bonuses, wrote the X user. This claim was made when some key Red Devils were afflicted with injuries. These injuries have failed to improve the team from its dismal 15th position on the league table and risk a first-time relegation . The claim was also found on Facebook and Threads . As of Monday, Feb. 24, 2025, the X post had generated 385000 views, 177 comments, 298 retweets, 6,400 likes, and 84 bookmarks. Surely, the post attracted several comments, including anxious and doubtful comments. Are we that desperate, offering Pogba 50k a week after he tanked our dressing room, cost us millions, and hasnt kicked a ball in two years? ( @reddevilrooney ) reacted. Given our condition, this is so expensive, ( @Anuj__31 ) stated. Who is your source Walt Disney? ( @rpj1354 ) queried. Due to the nature of the claim, its virality, and the diverse reactions to it, DUBAWA decided to verify its authenticity. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search for the claim but did not find any media reports about it. Moreover, we viewed Uniteds website for an official statement concerning the assertion but found no related news there. However, DUBAWA noticed that recent reports about the infamous French midfielders status and a move to a new club, including United, are only speculations. Yahoo Sports , Football 365 , and Goal.com have all suggested that Pogba may consider playing short-term for a club before joining a top-flight European outfit via summer transfer. All three outlets mentioned that the midfielder could play for Inter Miami in Major League Soccer (MLS) in the United States when his suspension elapses in March 2025 . The claim is false, as no evidence exists that United has purchased the former French midfielder.",0
"Claim: The national team is giving out 100GB as a gift to celebrate Nigerias win. Verdict: FALSE! We discovered that the link attached to the post had some domain issues. The link drives traffic to a website to generate sales, not to gift people data. People like to take advantage of trends or events to defraud others for their hard-earned money. Phishing attacks involve tricking a victim into taking action that benefits the attacker. Amidst the ongoing Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), a Facebook page, National Team 2024, posted that they wanted to celebrate the Super Eagles win against Angola. They claim they are gifting Nigerians 100 gigabytes of data to do this. The Facebook page requires viewers to click on a picture in the post to claim the gift. The post, embedded with a link , has garnered 1500 likes and 82 comments since it was posted on Feb. 4, 2024. The idyllic offer, the link attached to the claim, and its virality made us verify it. We discovered that the Facebook page is new, with eight followers and has no information about its purpose. An analysis of the post link using ScamDoc, a tool that evaluates the reliability of digital identities, showed that while the link met some requirements, the domain names owner was hidden. The link also redirects to Leadpages with an error message. Further investigation on the Leadpage shows that it is a site that helps people transform web traffic into leads and sales. Landing pages are often linked to social media, e-mail campaigns, search engine marketing campaigns, high-quality articles, or affiliate accounts to enhance the effectiveness of the advertisements. A landing page aims to convert site visitors into sales or leads. This explains why the Facebook page used an attractive offer to lure people to click the link. The post on celebrating the national teams victory is not to gift people data but to drive traffic to their website.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user with the name, Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld , has claimed that the linkage of National Identity Numbers (NINs) with SIM cards is a plot by the Nigerian Government to track and target social media users who use certain keywords to stimulate genocide in the country easier. Verdict: There is no evidence to prove the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is a plan to track social media users. According to available information, the policy as directed by the Federal Government is for security purposes and to ensure more controls over SIM ownership in Nigeria. A Facebook user with the name Bas Yahemeka Bijleveld on Dec. 24, posted that the Nigerian government was forcing Nigerians to link their NIN with SIM cards to make tracking of social media users easier. He added that the move would make it easy for the Federal Government to hire a company to compile a list of social media users who use some keywords to make targeted genocide easier. The Nigerian government is now saying they will force mobile phone providers to switch off all SIM cards that are not linked to a National Identification Number, he wrote. Why you should not do this? If you do, what becomes easy for the Nigerian government is to hire a company that shows a list of all citizens who write a certain key word on social media and in their phones and make lists per street who used those keywords, for instance everyone in the street who wrote Biafra. This is a tool that will make targeted genocide easier than ever before. As of December 27, the post had generated hundreds of reactions including 275 shares on Facebook. He wrote this following the Federal governments directive that all SIM owners in Nigeria must link their cards with their NINs or get blocked. Thousands of Nigerians have since trooped to NIN enrollment centres around the country to obtain their identification numbers. The Federal Government extended the deadline for incorporating NIN with SIM cards by six weeks after several complaints. According to the Nigerian Communication Commission (NCC), the linkage of SIM cards is necessary as more controls over SIM-card ownership are needed to secure electronic transactions and curb crime as insecurity bites harder in the country. The revision of the policy is based on the feedback received from the security agencies following the successful revalidation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their SIMs, Dr Isa Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy said as he directed the NCC to revise the registration policy. The government added that the Boko Haram insurgency and kidnapping for ransom have been reinforced by telecom services. There are over 207 million subscribers according to the latest NCC data for October 2020 but only 42 million Nigerians had a National Identification Number (NIN) as of September 2020. According to online data portal, Statista, Nigeria has a population of 206 million and about 100 million of them are adults. According to an analyst , Yele Okeremi, the CEO of Precise Financial Systems, the linkage of NIN with SIM cards is meant to generate a single identity for phone users in Nigeria. He said it would help to know who is doing what with phones and to detect cybercriminals. The entire concept is to know who is doing what and where, so that it is not possible to go away with cyber crimes with multiple identities, he said. According to a statement released by the NCC, Pantami and all stakeholders agreed that the measure was necessary to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process and consolidate the achievements of the SIM registration exercise of 2019. The urgent drastic measures have now become inevitable to improve the integrity and transparency of the SIM registration process, the statement said. The claim that the Nigerian Government has directed linkage of NIN with SIM cards to target social media users and make genocide easy has no evidence to back it.

"A viral WhatsApp video claims the Turkish president insulted president Muhammadu Buhari over #EndSARS killings FALSE Following the increasing number of casualties from the ongoing #EndSARS protest and reactions from different individuals and institutions, a viral WhatsApp video has come up with a claim that the Turkish president in a video insulted President Muhammadu Buhari over killings. The 30-second video captured a man attacking president Buhari and raining curses while questioning his religion. Buhari I am telling you, I am calling you from Instabul, I am calling you from Turkey, stop killing the people. Are you crazy? You idiot, you are a crazy man, what are you doing, which kind of religion do you believe in Excerpt of the viral video message A quick look at the video showed the person speaking in the video was not the Turkish president Tayyip Erdogan. A keyword search led to a Facebook post by Shadys media which shared a video that could not be viewed with the caption; Turkish president insults Buhari. The post also had a Youtube link embedded in it which led to an unrelated video. Screenshot of youtube page linked to the Facebook post. Dubawa also conducted Keyframe analysis of the video and google reverse image search of these frames. This showed the video was used on a Facebook post by Biafra News Channel on April 14 with the caption a message to Buhari from a Turkish Diplomat stop killing Biafrans please share this video share wide Another result of the reverse image search showed the video had also been used by African Tube on Facebook on March 31 noting Turkish Man comes hard for Buhari. The 30-second video is an old video that has been recirculated and is in no way related to the #EndSARS killing nor the president of Turkey which was said to be the one speaking in the video. The claim is false.",0
"Claim: Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso claimed that declaring a state of emergency in any Nigerian state does not affect the position of the elected governor. Verdict: True. Findings revealed that a state of emergency declaration does not affect the governor of the states position. On June 18 this year, Dr Rabiu Kwankwaso , the 2023 presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP), claimed that a declaration of a state of emergency in any state of Nigeria does not remove the governor from office. I want you to know that if the President declared a state of emergency in any state of the federation, the governor of the affected state would not be removed from office, and he would continue to execute his constitutional functions, Mr Kwankwaso argued. Mr Kwankwaso made the remarks while raising the alarm over purported Federal Government plans to declare emergency rule in Kano over the states emirate crisis. Recently, the NNPP-led Kano government dethroned the 15th Kano Emir, Aminu Bayero, and installed Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II. Mr Bayero was appointed in 2020 by the APC-led Kano government under Abdullahi Ganduje, now the APC National Chairman. The Federal Government has denied the allegation of planning to declare emergency rule in Kano. However, a state of emergency is when the government is given emergency legal powers to steer the country or part of it through a crisis or extraordinary situation to protect its citizens . It is a declaration made by the president with the approval of the National Assembly in response to extreme circumstances ranging from natural disasters to armed conflict, civil unrest, epidemics, or other biosecurity risks. Alkibla TV , a digital news platform, published the video in which Mr Kwankwaso was quoted making the claim. The post generated about 547,000 views, 16,000 likes, and 2,800 comments. An overview of the comments on Mr Kwankwasos claim shows diverse views on the claim. For instance, Bashir Aliyu said, Kwankwasos claim is not true, and he pretends as though he is a legal luminary. Abubakar Mohammed described the NNPP leaders claim as a radical political ideology. A radical approach, a reflection of Aminu Kanos legacies for political freedom, he said. Also, Abba Rimingado said Kwankwaso is unsure about his state of emergency declaration claim. You need to think twice, he insisted. Isa Usman said, Thats right (Kwankwaso) a man of his word. DUBAWA reviewed sections 305 and 11 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), interviewed lawyers, and analysed the position and functioning of governors in states where the state of emergency was declared. Based on provisions of section 305 of the 1999 Nigeria Constitution (amended), declaring a state of emergency in a state of the federation does not mean removing the governor from office. Also, only the president has the power to declare a state of emergency in Nigeria or any part of the country when there is war, danger of invasion, breakdown of public order and public safety, natural disaster, or threat to the existence of Nigeria. Section 305 (4 and 6c) states that The Governor of a State may, with the sanction of a resolution supported by a two-thirds majority of the House of Assembly, request the President to issue a Proclamation of a state of emergency in the State when there is in existence within the State any of the situations specified in subsection (3) (c), (d) and (e) of this section and such situation does not extend beyond the boundaries of the State. A state of emergency is for a renewable period of six months. After six months has elapsed since it has been in force: provided that the National Assembly may, before the expiration of the period of six months aforesaid, extend the period for the Proclamation of the state of emergency to remain in force from time to time for a further period of six months by resolution passed in like manner. Commenting, Barrister SG Idris said the governor of a state is not removed from office when the president declares a state of emergency in his domain. He said the constitution empowers state governors to request the president to declare a state of emergency when any of the reasons for such declaration arises, as specified in the constitution. It is worthy of note that the law is now settled that the president cannot hide under the guise of a State of Emergency to temper with the tenure of any state governor in contravention of the constitution, he said. In 2004, former President Olusegun Obasanjo declared a state of emergency in Plateau State, and Chris Ali was installed as the sole administration to replace the democratically elected governor of the state, Joshua Dariye . Similarly, in 2006, Obasanjo declared a state of emergency in Ekiti State and removed Fayose from office as governor for six months. However, during the reign of former President Goodluck Jonathan, a state of emergency was declared in Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States in 2011. Still, the governors of the states were allowed to continue leading. Mr Kwankwasos claim aligns with the constitutional provisions that a declaration of a state of emergency does not inherently affect the position and functioning of the governor. The 1999 Constitution, particularly Sections 305 and 11, does not grant the president or the National Assembly the power to remove or suspend governors during a state of emergency. This was observed in practice during President Jonathans administration, which contrasts with earlier practices under President Obasanjo.

"Claim: A Facebook user, Ivan Jaw, has alleged on Facebook that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Sierra Leone issued a notice warning that the current weather is not West African Harmattan but an extreme form of air pollution dangerous to human health. Verdict: Mary Sia Foyah, Senior Public Relations Officer at the Environmental Protection Agency, has dismissed the claim, stating that the notice did not come from the EPA and is fake. A Facebook post by Ivan Jaw has gone viral, alarming many people online. The post claims to be an official notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Sierra Leone, advising citizens to take precautions against what it describes as an extreme form of air pollution. The post urges the public to take the information seriously, emphasising it is a reliable message from the EPA. The post reads: This is an important notice from EPA, and we must follow it. URGENT NOTICE! URGENT NOTICE!! URGENT NOTICE!!! Dear Sir/Madam, The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has informed the public that the current weather in Sierra Leone is not a Harmattan but an extreme form of air pollution harmful to health. This can cause: Please take the following precautions: This situation may last for a while, so please stay safe and share this information with others. The post has since gained significant attention and caused panic among some citizens. Given the potential for misinformation, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. DUBAWA contacted Mary Sia Foyah, Senior Public Relations Officer at the Environmental Protection Agency. She unequivocally denied the posts authenticity, labeling it fake and stating that the EPA did not issue such notice. She explained, That information did not come from the EPA. It is false. We have already released a public disclaimer to alert the public that this message is not from us. Mary Sia Foyah further cautioned the public against relying on unverified information on social media. She urged people to confirm such notices with the appropriate authorities before sharing or acting on them. As part of the verification process, DUBAWA also reviewed other credible websites and platforms but did not see any report by the EPA. The claim made by a Facebook user Ivan Jaw that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) warned about extreme air pollution instead of harmattan, is false. The EPA has disclaimed the message, emphasising that it is fake and does not represent any official communication from the agency. To avoid panic, citizens must verify such claims with credible sources before spreading them.",1
"Claim: Governor Chief Nyesom Wike claims that Rivers State has never allocated less than 30 percent of its budget to education Governor Wikes claims to have never given less than 30% of budget allocation to education in Rivers State is untrue. Immanent data from the Rivers State government on the states budget contradicts the governors words. Hence this claim is false. Basic education is a right guaranteed by Nigerian laws. The 1999 constitution states that education is free of cost for all citizens. That is also backed up by the Compulsory, Free Universal Basic Education Act of 2004. Popularly called the UBE Act, it empowers state governments to develop basic education policy and strategy while local governments ensure service delivery and management. The Federal Government is responsible for setting national standards and maintaining regulations on them. What is regarded as basic education in the law is the first six years of primary school education and the three years of Junior Secondary School education, all spanning at least nine years. However, as some Nigerian governors appear to vie for the scrapping of the funding system, Chief Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State governor, while trying to dissociate himself from those calling for the scrapping of the counterpart funding system for basic education in the country, was quoted to have stated that In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget. Education and health are key. So, the federal government should try as much as they can to see that more funding is given to education. According to a press statement issued by Kelvin Ebiri, the Special Assistant to the governor on media, governor Wike was said to have made the statement when the Minister of State for Education, Hon Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, paid him a courtesy visit at Government House, Port Harcourt recently. Political office holders are accountable to the people and the accuracy of their statements is also as important as the role they play. Therefore, DUBAWA opts to verify the accuracy of Wikes statements. DUBAWA first reached out to Kelvin Ebiri, the Special Assistant to the governor via a phone call over the efficacy of the report. He confirmed that the report was indeed issued by him and it presents the governors statements when he received the minister of State for education in Port Harcourt: In this state, we have never given education less than 30 percent of our budget. Dubawa went through the states 2020 budget appropriation law presented on the official website of the Rivers State government. The budgets speech and summaries contradicted Wikes claims, it clearly stated that Building on the progress of the last four and half years, we will continue to ensure adequate funding for education in Rivers State. It is for this reason that we are proposing the sum of N49.471 billion to fund the education sector for 2020. This sum represents 20% of the total budget and is the highest ever budgetary allocation to education, reflecting the level of our commitment to investing in the future of our children. Dubawa went further to calculate the percentage of the acclaimed 49.471 Billion as 20% of the budget allocated to education in Rivers State in 2020. Results show that it was miscalculated, in fact, out of the 2020 total proposed budget of N530,813,357,619.00 (five hundred and thirty billion, eight hundred and thirteen million, three hundred and fifty-seven thousand, six hundred and nineteen naira) of Rivers state, the 49.471 billion naira only represented 9% of the entire budget and not 20% as claimed in the states 2020 budget outline. Also, the 2021 Rivers State approved budget totaled at four hundred and forty-eight billion, six hundred and sixty million, seven hundred and seven-three thousand, four hundred and seventy-six naira (N448,660,773,476) allocated thirty-billion, four hundred and sixty-six million, two hundred and one thousand Naira (N30,466,201,000.00) to education which represents just 6.7% of the 2021 total budget. These findings reveal a total contradiction to Governor Wikes claims of never allocating anything less than 30% to education. In fact, all the data extracted from the Rivers States government website, as outlined above, shows the highest attempt as stated by the state government was 20% which was even miscalculated. Governor Wikes claims to have never given less than 30% of budget allocation to education in Rivers State is untrue. Data from the Rivers State government on budget contradicts the governors words; hence, this claim is false.",0
"A viral WhatsApp message claims sending I do not authorise WhatsApp new policy to ten WhatsApp groups exempts you from the policy. False. Full Text In January, WhatsApp began notifying Its users of an update in its terms of service and privacy policy. The notification sent out to both Android and iOS users read, By tapping Agree, you accept the new terms and privacy policy, which take effect on 8 February 2021. After this date, youll need to accept these updates to continue using WhatsApp. There has been public confusion on what this new policy is about with misinformation spreading on this policy and what it means for the user. One section of the policy that raises concern among users is that user data is collected and shared with Facebook. The confusion surrounding the update has contributed to a mass of users moving to competing apps like Signal. According to a report by CNN Signal had about 7.5 million installations globally from the App Store and Google Play within three days. Quoting market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, this is more than 43 times the installations it received during the previous week. This led to a delay in the update of the policy. On Friday, January 15, 2021, Whatsapp announced moving back the update deadline from February 8, 2021, to May 15, 2021. Following this, a WhatsApp message going viral claims tomorrow begins the new WhatsApp rule, noting today is the deadline with no specific dates for tomorrow or today. First observation Dubawa noticed was the error in the spelling of WhatsApp as Whatsap all through the viral message. Claim 1: Today is the deadline for WhatsApps new rule, new rule begins tomorrow. The viral WhatsApp message claims the deadline is today with no specific date for today. This could mean anyway depending on when the message is shared or when the message gets to a user. For Example, Dubawa got the message on Sunday, January 17, 2021which then means the new rule begins Monday, January 18, 2021. This is false as the update sent to users by WhatsApp on January 4, 2021, noted users had to accept the policy by February 8, 2021, or lose access to their accounts. Also, a new update moved up the deadline to May 15, 2021. Claim 2: Everything posted can be published. This claim is false as WhatsApp has clearly stated it protects and secures personal messages and that the changes are related to optional business features on the app. According to WhatsApp, they cant see your personal messages or hear your calls and neither can Facebook, they dont keep logs of who everyone is messaging or calling, they cant see your shared location and neither can Facebook, they dont share your contacts with Facebook, groups remain private, you can set your messages to disappear , and you can download your data to see what information WhatsApp has on your account right from within the app. We want to be clear that the policy update does not affect the privacy of your messages with friends or family in any way. The changes are related to optional business features on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data. Excerpt of WhatsApps response to privacy policy questions. WhatsApp also noted that the new changes are to support over 175 million people who message a business account every day by enabling customer service to address questions or enquiries, discovering businesses through adverts on Facebook and Instagram, better shopping experiences so people with businesses on Facebook and Instagram can also expand to WhatsApp. Claim 3: Sending I DO NOT AUTHORIZE to ten WhatsApp groups protects your account from the new rule. According to this claim, after sending this to 10 groups, your account will get a tick () signal that means your account is now protected. This is false as dubawa followed the instruction and nothing appeared on the WhatsApp account. Dubawa also reached out out to WhatsApp Messenger support on this claimbut so far no response was received. All claims contained in this viral WhatsApp message are false.",0
"Claim: A WhatsApp poster claims the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is receiving applications for admission into its HND Nursing programme. This call for applications is genuine. The government has approved the HND Nursing programme in Monotechnics. Dubawa received a poster allegedly from the Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria, requesting applications for admission from para-military personnel and civilians into its ND/HND Nursing Programme. What is common knowledge is for citizens to study nursing in Schools of Nursing, receive the Certificate in Basic Nursing (which qualifies them to take the Registered Nurse Professional Certification examination) and become Registered Nurses (RN) thereafter. Some universities in Nigeria have also commenced the B.Sc Degree programme in Nursing a few years back. Most Nigerians are however not familiar with ND/HND degree programmes in Nursing. This explains why some WhatsApp users expressed doubts about the authenticity of the call for applications. Nigerians are bombarded daily with fake calls for higher education and/or scholarships into higher education , and it is therefore understandable if they are worried about a programme that is not common knowledge. Dubawa searched online for the website of the Nigerian Army School of Nursing in Lagos but could not find any links. What Dubawa found were several other education websites which had shared the Nigerian Army School of Nursings 2021 Call for Applications. Dubawa then placed calls to the four mobile lines on the application poster and after several trials, an individual picked the call placed to 07063374043. A man answered the line and explained that the call for application is genuine. The army officer, who demanded not to be identified due to service rules explained that the Nigerian government had reformed nursing education in Nigeria in collaboration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria and the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) . He said citizens can now earn degrees in Nursing through Universities (B.Sc Nursing) and Monotechnics (ND/HND Nursing). Students who study nursing in Monotechnics will write two professional examinations organised by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria to undertake their Registered Nurse Professional Certification (RN) and the Registered Midwife Professional Certification (RM), he explained. He stated further that the HND is a straight four year course, the first two years is ND while the last two years is the HND, and the HND is compulsory. They cant just walk away after the ND. They will also do a one year attachment before proceeding for NYSC. The Army Officer who insisted on being anonymous said the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is currently working on its website and hopes to have it up for Nigerians soon. A Nigerian parent, Mr. Dahiru Garba, also confirmed to Dubawa that his daughter is undertaking her HND programme in Nursing in the College of Nursing, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University Teaching Hospital, Bauchi State and that the HND programme in Nursing is genuine and has been approved by the government. He also told Dubawa that the Nursing and Midwifery Council is proposing to phase out the Certificate in Basic Nursing programme in 2023 and Nigerians can only do the ND/HND degree or the B.Sc degree programmes in nursing because there are issues with placing holders of the Certificate in Basic Nursing qualification in the civil service. Nigerian Army School of Nursing, Lagos was approved in 2018 (alongside 265 other approved institutions ) for the training of nurses in Nigeria by the Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (NMCN) as well as by the National Board of Technical Education . The Nigerian government approved the HND degree programme in Nursing, to be offered by monotechnics in the country in 2016 under a collaboration between the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE) and Nursing and Midwifery Council of Nigeria (N&MCN). The current call for applications for admission by the Nigerian Army School of Nursing is genuine.

"Claim: An X user claims via a video that policemen in an unnamed part of Kaduna state are fleeing from residents stoning them. Verdict: Misleading. The video clip is connected to the June Kenyan protests, during which Kenyan police officers fled from a disgruntled mob. The time of the initial post is also around the time the protest was on. The ongoing #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria protests have reached a sixth day, with citizens refusing to back down on a public demonstration against unfavourable government policies despite President Ahmed Tinubus public address to end the nationwide protests. Amidst these developments, an X user, @ElitesAfrica , posted a video of police officers fleeing from a small group of people who came at the former with stones. The X user further mentioned that the incident occurred in Kaduna state, a north-western part of Nigeria. Since the upload of the post, it has attracted 120 comments, 620 retweets, and 910 likes and was bookmarked 94 times as of Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024. While most X users noted that the video is connected with Kenya rather than Kaduna state, some thought otherwise. This is not Nigeria, @FknFootball stated. That cannot be Nigeria. Our police are trigger-happy, @Capolutiti opined. E don red for North, @keysense 1 commented, meaning things have worsened in the north. Due to the divergent reactions to the post, DUBAWA decided to verify it for clarification. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the video file and found that an X user, @kenyan431, had posted a similar video clip . The Kenyan X user posted on Jul. 17, 2024, that police officers in the country were fleeing from angry protesters who were using stones to chase them. Al Jazeera also reported the breakout of national protests by Kenyan citizens, calling for government reforms from President William Rutos unfair and unfavourable leadership. The Kenyan demonstrations had just reached their peak at the time the X post was posted. Besides, the #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria nationwide protests kicked off on Aug 1, 2024 . The incident in the video did not happen in Kaduna state amidst the ongoing #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria nationwide protests.",0
"Claim: CBN has announced a strategy to restore the Nairas value. Verdict: MISLEADING. Our findings show that the Central Bank has yet to announce any recent strategy for the Naira. The organisations media unit also debunked the message. The alleged content is a manipulated copy of the 2007 Strategy Agenda for the Naira. Amidst the continuous fluctuation in the value of the Naira against the United States (US) Dollar, a WhatsApp message claims that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has announced a new policy that would restore the value of the Naira, in which N1.25 would be equal to $1. Breaking News: Central Bank of Nigeria is about to introduce a new Naira policy by November 2023 that would make $1 USD exchange = N1.25. The new Strategic Agenda for the Naira was announced by the Central Bank of Nigeria, generating a healthy national debate. Before we undertake a nationwide enlightenment program (beginning November 2) to educate the public on the new policy, it is important to clarify some of the issues/questions that are emerging, part of the message reads. According to this message tagged as breaking news, the decision by the CBN was taken due to the directive of President Bola Tinubu to slow down inflation. The message advised that anyone with the old Naira should get ready to switch to the new one. It also encouraged readers to reshare for awareness. The virality of the claim and several requests from our WhatsApp community prompted us to verify it. A keyword search led to an article on the CBN website. The article revealed that the new Strategic Agenda for the Naira by the Central Bank of Nigeria was announced on August 14, 2007. According to the 2007 article, the 4-point agenda was designed to make the Naira the Reference Currency in Africa a part of the Financial Systems Strategy 2020 (FSS2020). Comparing the article on the 2007 Naira design policy and the said new policy, we observed the alleged new policy brief copied that of 2007 and only changed the dates. Scanning through the News segment of the Central Banks website, we saw no news or announcement of the alleged new Naira strategy. The only article on money was a communique at the monetary committee meeting, published on September 6, 2023. However, after we requested the CBNs comment on the viral post, they issued a disclaimer to the press, stating the message was false. They also shared it on their X ( Twitter) account. We reached out to the spokesperson and special adviser to the president on media, Ajuri Ngelale, to know if any new Naira policy was ordered by the president as alleged by the claim, but we are yet to receive any feedback. The viral WhatsApp message on a new Naira strategy is false. The content of the message is a revised copy of the 2007 Strategy Agenda for the Naira. The media unit of the Central Bank also debunked the claim.",1
"Claim: A Twitter user claims that Abdulrasheed Bawa, the new EFCC boss, has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency. The claim that Abdulrasheed Bawa, the new EFCC boss has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency is false. No sufficient evidence backed the information and EFCC has distanced itself from the information. Full text The Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) has been a predominant agency fighting against financial corruption mostly perpetrated by political officeholders in Nigeria. While the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is the agency saddled with the responsibility for conducting elections and vetting political aspirants. It is on the basis of the relationship these two agencies share, that a user on Twitter (@idowu553) claimed that Abdulrasheed Bawa has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency. With almost 550 reactions and over 250 retweets attributed to the claim, (@adinoyi12) one of the almost 120 commenters argued that: Fake news.Section 36 subsection(5) of the Constitution of Nigeria, 1999 amended provides that every person who is charged with a criminal offence shall be presumed to be innocent until he/she is proved guilty by competent court of jurisdiction Another user (@omoniyen) Added that This may be fake news. Is there any judiciary department at efcc? cos Nuhu Ribadu did same in 2007. All amounted to nothing and vacated by a court of competent jurisdiction. Regardless of the prevailing views around the claim, DUBAWA seeks to uncover the reality of the information. DUBAWA first reached out to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission through its head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, via phone call, he simply clarified that the report was false. He said that the Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, has not directed or advised the Independent National Electoral Commission against selling forms to persons with a file with the agency who are aspiring to contest in 2023 general elections. He further stressed that the EFCC chairman neither met with INEC officials nor made any pronouncement related to the election since he was appointed. Even more, the claimant has failed to provide the source of the information or state exactly where and when the EFCC chairman made the statement. Even as newsworthy as the information appears to be, no relevant media has reported on it or even made suggestions around it. Also, according to the Section 31(1)(6) of Electoral Act 2010 as amended, INEC cannot refuse to accept a partys list submitted within the stipulated time neither can it disqualify any candidate. The law stipulates that only a court of law can disqualify a candidate, not EFCC. The claim that Abdulrasheed Bawa, the new EFCC boss has directed INEC not to sell forms to any aspirant who has a file with the agency is false. There is no available evidence that points to the validity of the information.",0
"CLAIM: An image containing alleged results of the Sierra Leone election 2023 has gone viral on social media, with a Twitter user congratulating the All Peoples Congress Presidential candidate, Dr Samura Kamara, for winning the elections. The viral results contained election figures from Kenema, Kambia, and Karene districts. DUBAWA checked ECSLs website to verify the photo and claim, showing that all the results were from 2018. Wayback Machine also shows that the 2018 electoral commission results are an exact copy of what is being shared currently. VERDICT: FALSE; the viral photo is not the 2023 election result. It is the 2018 runoff results.",1
"CLAIM: The Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Sokoto, Matthew Kukah, claimed that President Bola Tinubu did not sign a peace accord when he was a presidential candidate in 2023. He disclosed this while speaking at the 2024 Edo Election Security Townhall organised by Channels TV on Sep. 15. It has also been published on Facebook as seen here , here and here . FINDINGS: Checks by the NFC show that two peace accords were signed by presidential candidates to prevent violence during Nigerias 2023 general election. Tinubu was absent at the first one organised by the National Peace Committee held on Sep. 29, 2022. He was, however, represented by his vice, Kashim Shettima. However, Tinubu was present at the signing of the second pact held on Feb. 23, 2023. VERDICT: INCORRECT SOURCES: TheCable, The Punch",1
"Claim: A TikTok user claimed that Gambian sensational singer Jizzle had met Nigerian Afrobeat superstar Davido. Verdict: False. The claim that Gambian singer Jizzle has met Nigerian Afrobeats superstar Davido is false. A TinEye Reverse Image Search shows the picture was manipulated. A TikTok user posted a photo of Gambian sensational singer Jerreh Jallow, whose stage name is Jizzle, with Nigerian superstar David Adeleke, whose stage name is Davido. Jizzle is one of Gambias most popular Gambian singers with numerous hit songs. As of July 25, 2024, the post, shared on TikTok, had gathered over 8,489 likes, 153 comments, 1,456 favourites, and 38 shares. In the comments section, people shared diverse opinions, with some suggesting it was an edit while others believed it was real. The photo has since generated mixed reactions. A user @TIO said : Seems Photoshop because their colour corrections are not the same. @Abdosevan5 also commented on the post, saying, So Jizzle dont care to put his shoe on Davido my friend, this na edit. @Lamin commented: Who told you guys this is an editing? It is a real-life thing. Against this backdrop, DUBAWA ran a fact-check to determine the posts authenticity. A Tin Eye Reverse Image Search revealed that the picture of Jizzle and Davido has been manipulated several times; see here and here . DUBAWA sighted the original picture of Davido that was posted on March 14, 2020 . The post said Davido had postponed his concerts in America. Nigerias top singer, David Adedeji Adeleke [Davido], has cancelled his concerts in the United States of America due to the coronavirus pandemic, the post said. An examination of the image of Jizzle shows that the picture has been superimposed on the photograph of Nigerian Superstar Davido. Also, Jizzle is currently outside the country on a European Tour and frequently updates his activities on his official Facebook page, Jizzle, which has over 237k followers. When DUBAWA checked Jizzles social media handles, including Facebook, he did not post the alleged photo with Davido. We also checked major news media and online platforms in The Gambia; there were no reports of Jizzle meeting Davido. DUBAWA also contacted Jizzles management, who described the post as false. This is fake and edited. Jizzle has not met David, said Jalika, a member of Jizzles management. The claim that Gambian singer Jizzle has met Nigerian Afrobeats Superstar Davido is fake.",1
"Claim: The newly constructed roundabout is not in Aba Verdict: Our findings from newspaper reports, Google Earth, and the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation revealed that the structure is Emelogu Road in Aba. Abia State, a place in the southeast region of Nigeria, has begun to witness tremendous transformations and rehabilitations in both her social and infrastructural developments thanks to her newly elected governor, Alex Otti. Mr Otti won the states top political seat on the Labour Party (LP) platform in the March 18, 2023 gubernatorial elections. In light of these developments, a Facebook user, who identifies as Igbo Times Magazine, expressed doubts about the pictorial representation of one of the towns, Aba, where rehabilitation occurred. This road can never be Aba. We bet with our left head this cannot be Aba. Part of the claim read. The post attracted 589 reactions, including 389 comments, and was shared 28 times as of Tuesday, Sept. 19, 2023. It was observed that a good number of online users disagreed with the post. Thats Emelogu Road! Otti is the messiah of Aba, Promise Prince Emmanuel wrote . This is 100% Aba, Clement Goodluck also wrote . Due to the controversy generated by the post, DUBAWA decided to fact-check the claim. We made a keyword search on some of the roads newly constructed by Governor Otti and came across a Vanguard newspaper report . The report names Emelogu, Shalom, and Cemetery roads as the projects recently commissioned by the governor. Further searches linked us to a New Telegraph report mentioning that all three roads are in Aba. It also added a picture of a road roundabout quite similar to the one posted by the claimant. Consequently, we conducted a geolocation search on Google Earth with the names of the roads reported in the paper. We could link the said roads location with Emelogu Road, Aba. The satellite image provided by Google Earth shows a similar road structure to that of the image in question. Also, the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation published a report informing on the newly constructed roads commissioned by Governor Otti, including Emelogu, Shallom, and Cemetery roads. The pictures presented in the publication , include an improved rehabilitation of a road roundabout similar to the one portrayed by Google Earth. The claim is false. Findings from newspaper reports, Google Earth, and the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation identify the Emelogu road in Aba.",1
"The Facebook page Elon Musk Official Pager is calling on users to take part in its biggest Bitcoin giveaway.

I decided to make the biggest crypto- giveaway in the world, for all my readers who use Bitcoin. One of the two images accompanying the text gives more details about how the promotion works. To participate you just need to send from 0.025 BTC to 1 BTC to the contribution address and we will immediately send you back from 0.05 BTC to 2 BTC (x2) to the address you sent it from, it says . Bitcoin , also known as BTC, is a digital currency built on blockchain technology. It has no centralised regulators or government interventions. Elon Musk is the founder of electric vehicles manufacturer, Tesla , and owner of social media platform Twitter, rebranded to X in July. He is also the worlds richest person. We found similar posts here , here , here , here , here , here and here . But is there such a giveaway by Musk and is the Facebook page to be trusted? There are several signs that point to Elon Musk Official Pager being a fake Facebook page. One of them is that it has no followers. Musk has a huge following on social media, with over 153 million followers on Twitter alone. In a reply to a tweet in 2018, Musk said he didnt have a Facebook account. This also explains why the suspicious page is not verified by Meta. Another reg flag is the promise of a huge payout. The page claims users will get double of what they put in. The goal could be to lure users into making large deposits but never paying them the promised returns. If Musk was running any kind of promotion like this one, it would have made international headlines. But there are no reports from credible news agencies of him giving away 5,000 Bitcoin (US$147,350,000 at the time of writing). The Elon Musk Bitcoin giveaway is a scam that has affected thousands of people across the world. In 2021, the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) reported how Julie Bushnell, a teacher, was conned into depositing 9,000 (approximately $11,500) with the hope of receiving double that amount back. Africa Check found a website where more information about the supposed giveaway is shared. The site also promises to double users money.

"CLAIM: People should eat watermelon with the seeds as it contains vital nutrients essential to the body. Viral post on WhatsApp advising people to eat watermelon with the seeds because it is enriched with a lot of essential minerals and vitamins is TRUE. Recently, a viral message on social media, especially on WhatsApp claimed that watermelon seeds are one of the most nutrient-dense varieties of seeds, which are rich in proteins, vitamins, magnesium, zinc and potassium which are all vital nutrients. Many people in Africa believe in the efficacy of herbs in treating different diseases. These days, it is common to see claims about these cures on social media. While many of such claims may not be true, others are. Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) is a flowering plant species of the Cucurbitaceae family and the name of its edible fruit. A scrambling and trailing , vine-like plant, it was originally domesticated in Africa. It is a highly cultivated fruit worldwide, with more than 1,000 varieties. Watermelon Source: Britanica.com Watermelon is an incredibly hydrating fruit as it contains around 92 percent of water, and is enriched with a lot of essential minerals and vitamins. This succulent melon also contains a lot of seeds, which we generally throw away after consumption. Dubawa researched why watermelon seed is believed to be an essential seed. A search on the website of Science Publishing Group , an independent international publisher of open access, online, peer-reviewed journals covers a wide range of academic disciplines. The Group has a post in the International Journal on Nutrition and Food Nutrition containing research carried out by Faustina Dufie Wireko-Manu an Associate Professor in Food Science and Technology, Dr. Jacob K. Agbenorhevi a Senior Lecturer, Elsa I. Ompouma and Betty Tabiri, all of the Department of Food Science and Technology, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Kumasi, Ghana. The research titled Watermelon Seeds as Food: Nutrient Composition, Phytochemicals and Antioxidant Activity was published on March 30, 2016. Screenshot of journal The research recognised the fact that watermelon seeds are often discarded while the fruit is eaten. The study analyzed seeds of three varieties of watermelon (Charleston gray, Crimson sweet and Black diamond) for their proximate, minerals, phytochemicals, total phenols content and antioxidant activity. The proximate analysis and phytochemicals screening were performed using standard procedures whereas mineral content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Screenshots of findings The study showed that watermelon seeds are a rich source of fibre and minerals that are essential in the body system. The Dean, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Ilorin and a Professor of Food Science and Technology Mrs Yinka Ramota Karim, stated that the watermelon seeds contain a high level of magnesium which is essential for many of the bodys metabolic functions, maintains nerve and muscle functions as well as immune, heart and bone health. She added: The seeds of the watermelon improves skin health by treating acne, blemishes, wrinkles and ageing, helps in strengthening the hair, improves heart health, boosts the immune system, improves male fertility, boosts energy levels among others. Similarly, a food nutritionist, Mrs Yejide Akinseyin stated that watermelon seeds are one of the secrets of nature that can be used for many things that benefits the body like a snack ( roasted and milled into flour for the production of snack), salad dressings, especially the oils expressed from it and smoothies. Although patients who are suffering from low blood sugar are advised not to consume much of this seed as it has the ability to further lower blood pressure which may lead to sudden death, apart from that the watermelon seed is very nutritious and safe for every healthy individual, she said. An article posted in the Times of India highlighted the amazing health benefits of eating watermelon seeds which it describes as low in calories and offer an array of micronutrients like copper, zinc, potassium, magnesium, iron, folate etc; which have various health benefits. Some of them are listed below: Watermelon seeds are also linked with stronger immunity and better health. Due to the presence of magnesium these seeds can also cure hypertension, which is directly related to heart health. Consumption of watermelon seeds daily in moderate quantities helps in boosting your heart health and maintaining your blood pressure. Watermelon seeds have a high content of minerals like copper, manganese and potassium. And these minerals together with other micronutrients help in making our bones healthier. The seeds are linked with strengthening our bones and also improving bone density. Watermelon seeds are a powerhouse of nutrients like folate, iron, zinc, copper, magnesium, potassium. These seeds are considered to be highly nutritious, as they are also rich in amino acids, proteins and vitamin B complex. All these nutrients together help in boosting your bodys metabolism. They contain certain healthy fats which are extremely important for the body. Watermelon seeds are a good source of healthy fatty acids like oleic acid, linoleum which are required for proper functioning of the body.

"Claim: Africa Facts Zone claims Moroccos triumph over Portugal in the quarter-final of the ongoing FIFA World Cup will give Africa 11 slots at the 2026 edition. Verdict: FALSE Following the triumph of the Atlas Lions of Morocco in the third semi-final match at the ongoing 2022 Federation of International Football Association (FIFA) World Cup on Saturday, December 10, 2022, the entire African continent was thrown into a frenzy. Its the first time an African team would reach the semi-finals in the 92 years history of the quadrennial global sports event. The world cup currently ongoing in Qatar has elicited both online and offline reactions globally. One such reaction trailed the historical feat came from Africa Facts Zone , which dubbed itself Africas biggest facts brand and the worlds most up-to-date facts platform in its Twitter bio . Its Twitter handle @AfricaFactsZone has about 853,000 followers. While the match was ongoing at about 4:36 PM (WAT) on Saturday, Africa Facts Zone twe eted, If Morocco defeats Portugal and qualifies for the semi-finals of the FIFA World Cup, Africa will get 11 slots in the 2026 World Cup. 9 permanent slots, one via playoff and one because they reached the semi-finals. As of Sunday morning, the tweet has already garnered 351 comments, 7,102 retweets and over 27,000 likes. This tweet also sparked a reaction from Twitter users. In a reaction, Nuno Sousa (@nnuunneexx), wrote : @motlaleexcel, this is what I meant! Reach later stages get more slots ! Basic maths. @nnuunneexx obviously believed Africa Facts Zone and even used it to prove his erroneous belief to another user. Another user, Foz (@FozGharby), was curious when he asked , Is that true? That spots at the next WC linked to performance this WC (sic)? Morocco went on to make history as the first African country to reach the FIFA World Cup Semi-final after Youssef En-Nesyris first half-header helped the Atlas Lions defeat their Portuguese opponents. Does this victory mean the Confederation of African Football (CAF) would get 11 slots at the 2026 FIFA World Cup? Since the number of participating teams at the world cup increased at the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, five countries have continued to represent Africa at the competition. However, FIFA, at a meeting held on January 9 and 10, 2017, at the FIFA headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, expanded the competition to allow the participation of 48 teams/countries from the current 32 teams competing for the 18-karat gold trophy. The 48-team version of the competition is set to debut at the 2026 edition of the FIFA World Cup, which Canada, Mexico would host, and the United States after their joint bid defeated Moroccos bid during the voting for host selection which took place during the 68th FIFA congress on June 13, 2018. On Thursday, March 30, 2017, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and the presidents of the six football confederations met and agreed on slot allocation for the new 48-team format. The FIFA Council ratified the slot allocation at its meeting on May 9, 2017, in Bahrain. CAF was allocated nine direct slots, Asian Football Confederation (AFC) got eight direct slots, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) got 16 direct slots, Oceania Football Association (OFA) got one direct slot, and the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), the Confederation of North, Central, American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) got six direct slots each. This gives room for an intercontinental playoff for the remaining two slots. The playoff would involve a team from each of the confederations except UEFA and one additional team from the confederation of the host country. From the above allocation, Africa has nine sure slots, while one more African country will head to an intercontinental playoff involving five other countries worldwide. Two countries in the playoff will qualify for the 2026 World Cup. So far, FIFA has not mentioned anywhere that a semi-final spot would increase the slot of a countrys confederation at the next edition. The claim by Africa Facts Zone is wrong. Africa wont get 11 slots at the 2026 FIFA World Cup because Morocco qualified for the semi-final of the 2022 edition. Africa will get nine direct slots and have the chance of having one more country in the competition through a playoff.",0
"Claim : A viral post on Facebook states that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all banks ATM cards currently used by customers. Verdict: TRUE. The Central Bank of Nigeria launched a domestic card scheme to kickstart January 2023. The scheme is aimed at unifying payments in Nigeria and promoting financial inclusion. However, the deployment of cards under this scheme has not started. As the global financial space moves to deepen financial inclusiveness and promote cashless transactions, apex banks are further moving with the tide by implementing innovative solutions for seamless transactions. Recently, a viral post shared by Oluwatofunmi Wisdom on a popular Facebook group with over 400,000 Facebook users stated that Nigerias apex bank would, on January 16, 2023, introduce a unified ATM card and suspend all other cards. Reacting to this post, Ohegam Iyoba Fruitfulness asked questions on how this will affect National Identity Cards and wondered how this move will affect his transactions. Other Facebook users in the comment thread shared the same scepticism with many questions begging for answers. The significance of this claim and the conflicting comments that have followed encouraged the need to verify this assertion and set the records straight to enlighten Nigerians. A quick google check revealed in a report that the Central Bank of Nigeria, in collaboration with the Nigeria Inter-Bank Settlement System , launched the National Domestic Card Scheme. The scheme is expected to unify payments in Nigeria and bring more unbanked Nigerians in the informal sector into the financial system. The card is also expected to rival heavyweights such as Mastercard and Visa. Nwanisobi Osita, Director of Corporate Communications at the CBN, in a statement, said, Domesticating our card scheme also enhances data sovereignty, enabling the development of locally relevant products and services and reduces demands on foreign exchange. This announcement was also reported by Premium Times , Vanguard, in October 2022 and recently by Punch and the Sun News online. In a phone interview, Emmanuel Idenyi Shaibu , a banking sector analyst, confirmed that the scheme kick-started on January 16th. However, he stated that commencement and disbursement would kickstart after the Central Bank of Nigeria agreed with the bankers committee. According to him, the new cards will not phase out the old cards. He further disclosed that the card would be independent of Visa and Mastercard while noting that the only challenge would be issues around the unified card being compromised. Emmanuel Idenyi urged Nigerians to use these unified cards when they become accessible on accounts meant for just daily transactions. Based on official statements from the Central Bank of Nigeria and the NIBSS, the new debit card scheme starts on January 16, 2023. Still, there are no confirmations about when customers will use the new cards and the current cards will cease functioning.

"Claim: A social media user posted that Eggs are not healthy food, and their consumption increases the risk of preventable diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Verdict: MISLEADING. Available studies on egg consumption and the risk of heart disease are mixed. Some reported increased risk, while others reported no association. Over the years, the discourse on the association between egg consumption and the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and other diseases has remained controversial. Several studies have been conducted on egg consumption and the risk of coronary artery disease, ischemic disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. However, the findings from these studies were mixed. Some studies reported increased risk, while others reported no association. Based on the topics controversial nature, there seems to be no universally acceptable verdict on egg consumption and the risk of heart disease and diabetes. However, the discussion has resurfaced on social media in recent times. An X user, Tofur (@Alexzia777), posted that eggs are not healthy food and that their consumption increases the risk of preventable diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Comments under the post reveal varying views among users, with some expressing doubts while others supporting the claim. A user, @CarDen1974, commented, Just show me one peer-reviewed study (so no reviews) that proves eggs are unhealthy, and I will go vegan, too. Another user, @Ferlonso14, said, Eggs are a superfood. They dont increase the risks of anything, buddy. They contain heart-healthy nutrients. As of March 20, 2024, the post has attracted 1,885 views, 53 likes, 25 retweets and comments. We decided to verify the integrity of the claim due to the significant impact the claim holds on peoples health. Eggs are a source of protein derived from chickens and are a typical food eaten worldwide. One whole egg is rich in vitamins A, B2, B12, B5, and minerals vital for human health. However, eating eggs is controversial due to its high concentration of cholesterol, which is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. The body needs a moderate cholesterol level to build and repair the cells. Cholesterol comes from two sources: the body and the food we eat, such as meat, dairy foods, and eggs. The cholesterol from the body is called blood cholesterol, which is either good cholesterol (HDL) or bad cholesterol (LDL). When LDL is produced in excess, it sticks to the walls of the arteriesvessels that circulate blood in the body. This process narrows the artery and increases the risk of heart disease. A study, Eggs and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Update of Recent Evidence, by Sharayah Carter et al., reviewed 35 studies on eggs and the risk of heart disease. The review showed most studies are unable to establish a causal relationship between egg intake and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Furthermore, it explained that the controversy on egg consumption is because foods that are high in cholesterol also have saturated fats, which can increase bad cholesterol in the body and the risk of heart disease. However, eggs have low saturated fat but, like any other food, are often consumed with different foods, which can influence the total cholesterol and saturated fat intake. So, sometimes, it is not only about the cholesterol in eggs consumed but also the amount of cholesterol in other foods paired with eggs. Jo Carson, a professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, in the American Heart Association News asserted that amidst the controversy on egg consumption, the key is for people to know their risk factors. She stated that people who are at risk of diabetes or heart attack should be cautious of the amount of cholesterol in their daily diet. But thats not to say cholesterol makes eggs a harmful choice. Eggs may be considered less dangerous if a persons diet contains little other cholesterol. For someone whos decided to go vegetarian, and theyre not eating red meat, maybe the only source of cholesterol would be in an egg, she said. Pradeep Natarajan, a cardiologist and director of the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Center, mentioned that if eggs are eaten in moderation, they can be part of a healthy diet. He stated, Eggs are fine, but limit the total amount to one per day, averaged over a week, without going into extreme excess in one day. Most systematic reviews and meta-analyses either found a link or no link between egg and heart disease risk. These conflicting results contribute to the ongoing debate over the influence of egg intake on heart disease risk. We spoke to Jeffrey Ajoko, a medical doctor at International SOS, on egg consumption and the risk of heart disease, who explained that eggs are a good source of protein. Still, their high deposit of cholesterol is sometimes associated with the risk of heart disease. He asserted that Heart disease is a wide spectrum, but the aspect of heart disease linked to egg consumption is atherosclerosis, which deals with hardening of heart tissues. Atherosclerosis occurs when excess cholesterol is deposited in the body. It could block the artery and obstruct blood circulation. To clarify the confusion surrounding the topic, the American Heart Association suggests one whole egg (or two egg whites) per day for people who include eggs in their daily diet, Dr Ajoko said. Studies on the association between egg consumption and the risk of heart disease and diabetes remain inconclusive. While some studies show a connection between egg intake and the risk of heart disease, other studies show no connection.

"Claim: Different Twitter accounts shared a video of Pastor Kumuyi and his wife, claiming that the clergy relocated to London after advising Nigerians to endure the Tinubu-led administration. Verdict: Misleading! Findings show that although Pastor Kumuyi stated he resided in London, United Kingdom, a long time before his advice to Nigerians, the video in question was taken in Kyiv, Ukraine. For a while now, there has been an increasing wave of Nigerians emigrating to other parts of the world for greener pastures, including academic pursuits and better living standards. The situation has made the phenomenon called Japa, a Yoruba term meant to run or escape, an issue of national concern. The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) announced that it issued over two million passports in 2023 alone. Amidst this surge of emigration, an X user, @Dearestjessica1 , claimed that Pastor William Kumuyi, the General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, has relocated to London and attached a video to prove her claim. GO of Deeper Life, Pastor Kumuyi, has relocated to London after deceiving his members that Tinubu will build Nigeria. The video caption reads. The claim was made in reaction to a public appeal of the cleric asking Nigerians to support Tinubu and his newly appointed ministers and believe that God will use them as instruments to build our nation. Also, during an October 2023 global crusade held in Benin, Edo State, the pastor told the congregation not to leave their country because he believed that prosperity would come there. As of May 27, 2024, this post had amassed over 100,000 views, 540 likes, and 370 reposts. A commenter, @Seyialli, said: The extent to which you guys will go knows no bounds. Fake news peddler on behalf of adult beer! [sic] Another commenter, @Okwuchukwu97984, added, This is an old video, biko. Check this video. He should be around his early seventies. The man is 83 going around ministering. Kumuyi lives in (G)bagada Lagos Nigeria(.) He left (A)bia state earlier this month for India. (H)es presently in Cameroon, you can join (their) Monday Bible study online to verify(.) (I)ts going on now, so no need to insult anyone(.) @HouseofNweze noted in the comment section. Additionally, several other social media users and blogs shared the same claim, corroborating the narrative. See here , here , here , here and here . The posts virality led DUBAWA to fact-check the claim to set the record straight. After carefully examining the video, we conducted advanced keyword searches to obtain details about it and found that it is not recent. On Sunday, April 26, 2017, Adelaja, a Nigerian pastor and founder of the Embassy of God, a church in Ukraine, posted a video showing Pastor Kumuyis visit to his church in a foreign country. In the video clip, Pastor Kumuyi mentions that he is a native of Nigeria but based in London, United Kingdom. It is also noteworthy that the location of the video, where the interview was taken, is Ukraine. Although the Facebook post was made in 2017, DUBAWA discovered that 2011 the Embassy of God Church included an illustrative picture of the clergy and his wife on the churchs official website. The photo used in a report about Pastor Kumuyis second visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2011 was taken from the video material presented by Pastor Adelaja on Facebook. Also, we found his ministerial speech here to the church members. The claim is misleading. Findings show that Pastor Kumiyi had relocated to London long before he advised Nigerians. Moreover, the video in question was made in Kyiv, Ukraine.",0
"Claim: Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch the One Health Strategic Plan. False! Our findings show Nigeria is not the first country in Africa to launch the One Health Strategic Plan because we found other countries with plans released earlier. Climate change has become a major discussion in the world with different stakeholders brainstorming on how best to mitigate its effect. One of these efforts birthed what is now known as One Health . This is an approach by countries to design and implement programmes, policies, legislation and research for multiple sectors to communicate and work together towards achieving better public health outcomes. While the term One Health is fairly new, the concept has been in existence for a long time and has been recognised globally. It can be traced to when the link between human and animal health was established between 1821 to 1902. One Health became a recommended approach and political reality in 2008 when representatives from more than 120 countries and 26 international and regional organisations attended the 2008 International Ministerial Conference on Avian and Pandemic Influenza in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The first One Health Summit was held in Davos, Switzerland in 2012 and has subsequently gained recognition globally as an effective way to fight health issues at the human-animal-environment interface, including zoonotic diseases. African ministers of health and environment demonstrated an early commitment to One Health when they signed the Libreville Declaration at the first Inter-Ministerial Conference on Health and Environment in 2008 and subsequently endorsed a 10-year Strategic Action Plan to scale up health and environment interventions in Africa from 2019 to 2029 at the third Inter-Ministerial Conference in 2018. On Wednesday, April 20, 2022, during the the Centre for Journalism Innovation and Development (CJID Master Class on health, environment and climate change reporting, the centres health program officer, Adebowale Adedigba, said Nigerias health minister of state health, Adeleke Mamora, claims Nigeria is the first country in Africa to launch the one health strategic plan. Did the minister actually make this claim? If yes, how true is this claim? This prompted us to verify this claim. To establish if the minister made this claim at any point, we conducted a keyword search and found a report by reliefweb which noted the minister said this at the launch of the plan in 2019. Nigeria has developed a One Health strategic plan to meet its human, animal and environmental health challenges. This approach drives innovations that are important to manage the outbreaks we experience and offers synergy across our various ministries. We hope that the implementation of this plan in Nigeria can serve as a model for other African countries, the report quoted the minister. Another report by Business Day also quoted the minister as saying the same thing. Having established the minister said this, we needed to know if this narrative is true so we searched for other African countries One Health plan and when they were created or launched. This article looks at the successes and future challenges of One Health in the African context using three countries; Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda so we searched for the three countries. Nigerias one health strategic plan which is an 80 page document, is a five year plan from 2019 to 2023. We found out that Tanzania has a 66 page One Health plan from 2015-2020 . We also found Uganda has a one health plan for 2018-2022 . The 52 page document is a product of a collaboration between Ugandas Ministry of Health (MoH), Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries (MAAIF), Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) and Ministry of Water and Environment (MWE) with financial and technical support from United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/EPT-2 Preparedness and Response (P&R) Project. Looking at these documents by the three countries, we can see Tanzania had its One Health document in 2015, followed by Uganda in 2018 before Nigerias 2019-2023 plan. Our findings show Nigeria is not the first country in Africa to launch the One Health plan because we found one health plan documents by Tanzania in 2015 and Uganda in 2018.",0
"Claim: An online bloc, Shine Liberia, alleges that the National Elections Commission has dismissed over 60 employees. Verdict: Misleading! The National Elections Commission has not dismissed over 60 employees. An online bloc Shine Liberia on Tuesday, December 3, 2024, alleged that the National Elections Commission dismissed over 60 employees. National Elections Commission reportedly dismissed over 60 employees for what the chairperson called abandonment of assignment. Days ago, scores of NEC employees staged protests at their HQ to demand their benefits and salary increase. You allegedly took food from the tables of people for exercising their rights. The post generated a lot of engagements, including two comments, 36 likes, and 15 shares. One of the commenters, Anthony K G Freeman Jr., raised concern over the lack of an NEC stamp to help validate the document. Unfortunately, theres no stamp to help us authenticate the validity of this document. DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim as part of its aim to counter misinformation and disinformation. DUBAWA contacted the claimant via messenger to provide further evidence to support the claim, but they refused to respond to our inquiries. We also contacted Prince Dumbar, the Deputy Director of Communications at the National Elections Commission, who described the claim made by the online bloc as false. He stated that the National Elections Commission has only dismissed 25 employees for what he described as gross misconduct. I dont know where they get their information from, but what I do know is that the National Election Commission dismissed 25 employees for misconduct. You can check local dailies; it is there. Unlike Shine Liberi, several other agencies, including Hot Pepper , Newdawn , Daily Observer , Afric Daily Newspaper, and AllAfrica, reported that 25 employees were dismissed. DUBAWA found no evidence that the National Elections Commission dismissed 60 employees while the Deputy Director of Communications at NEC also denied the claim.",1

"Claim: Youths aged between 15 and 35 account for over 65 per cent or around 130 million of Nigerias 200 million population. Verdict: Insufficient evidence. Ahead of the 2023 presidential election, Bola Tinubu, one of the major contenders, has released his manifesto informing Nigerians of his action plan if elected. Tinubu has consistently promised to replicate his achievements as governor of Lagos State at the Federal level with his running mate, Kashim Shettima. The former Lagos governor also said he would focus on sectors ranging from economy to security and education if elected. He also said his government would mainly focus on the teeming youth population of Nigeria, facing unemployment challenges. Mr Tinubu, in his policy document, said his administration would pay special attention to the youth. The ex-governor also said the youths aged between 15 and 35 account for over 65 per cent or over 130 million of the population in Nigeria. According to Worldometer , Nigeria has a population of over 200 million people. In July, the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs released the World Population Prospects 2022. According to the report , the world population could grow to 8.5 billion in 2030. The report also estimat ed that over the next three decades, Nigeria would likely be the third most populated country, with 375 million people and youths who will account for about 262 million of the population. The population in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa is projected to double between 2022 and 2050, putting additional pressure on already strained resources and challenging policies aimed to reduce poverty and inequalities, the UN said. In an earlier report, the United Nations noted that the African continent has the youngest population in the world, with about 70 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa under 30, adding that this can be an opportunity for the continents growth. However, concerned stakeholders have ignited a discourse on whether the governments of these countries, Nigeria inclusive, are ready to provide the needed infrastructure to harvest the potential of their young population. Just recently, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) stated that over 130 million Nigerians are multidimensionally poor. The rate of unemployment among Nigerian youths has continued to worsen. The latest data from the NBS pegged the countrys unemployment rate at 33.3 per cent in the last quarter of 2020. Statista showed that half of the countrys population is under 19 years, with the highest age bracket being children under four years old (16.3 per cent). This is closely followed by children aged 5 to 9. The percentage of male children in this age group is 7.4%, while 7.1% are females. The body further noted that Nigeria has one of the youngest populations in the world. Another recent dat a from Statista on the age distribution of Nigerias population shows children within 0-14 years representing 43.31%, while the highest age group are those between the ages of 15-64 years old, representing 53.9% of the population. Also, 2021 d ata from the World Bank showed that people aged 0 to 14 years old form a major part of Nigerias population, with 43.3% of the total population, while those aged 15-64 years old make up 53.7% of the population. Those between the ages of 65 and above make up the least part of the population, with 2.98% of the total population. There is no data specifically for the population between ages 15 to 35 years old. It is unclear where Mr Tinubu got his data on the youth population. On the phone, efforts to contact Festus Keyamo, the spokesperson of the APCs Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), proved abortive as his number was unreachable as of the time of filing this report. A text message sent to him was also not replied to. There is insufficient evidence to support the assertion that 130 million Nigerians, or 65% of Nigerias 200 million population, represent youths aged 15-35.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the Federal Government is offering money to Nigerians under the National Youth Empowerment Fund. The Nigerian government is not offering national youth empowerment funds. The viral message is a fraudulent method used by ill-meaning individuals to entice and extort money from unsuspecting members of the public. The Federal Government (FG) of Nigeria has, over the years, introduced a number of initiatives to empower Nigerians, in an effort to curtail poverty and accelerate growth. Examples of federal empowerment initiatives include the N-Power programme for unemployed youths and the school feeding programme which the federal government under President Muhammad Buhari started in 2016. Recently, a message is making the rounds on WhatsApp, with the claim that a National Youth Empowerment Fund application form for 2022 is out. According to the message, the empowerment fund, which is supposedly the quickest to apply for, is now out for all bonafide Nigerian citizens who need helping hands in their various businesses and education. This fund, according to the viral message, has a vision of giving out N150,000 to N550,000 grants to every citizen under the age of 13-65 years from 2022 to 2024. The message also claims payment for the month of April is currently ongoing. Due to the virality of this claim and the possible harm it could cause, we chose to verify it. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the youth empowerment fund mentioned in the message but did not find any. Our findings led to the Presidential Youth Empowerment Scheme (P-YES) but there are no calls for applications at the moment. The original P-YES was an initiative started by the current administration in 2020, Nairametrics reported. As noted on the official website , the Office of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation oversees the scheme, which is coordinated by the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the president on Youth and Student Affairs. Interestingly, an analysis of the link on Domainbigdata, a web service used to verify domains ownership, reveals multiple users have reported the website for abuses. The existence of phony testimonial remarks was another obvious red flag. Internet con artists frequently use this method to draw potential victims into their cave. The links to the supposed comments are not clickable, yet they nevertheless function as a device intended to deceive users. DUBAWA also found that the flags of South Africa, Ivory Coast, Ghana, The Gambia, Nigeria and Uganda are visible on the landing page. This implies that the creator of the page is targeting African countries for his/her mischievous plans. The to the website is also a Bitly URL website. Bitly URL was founded in 2008 as a link shortening and management application. Bitly shortens more than 600 million links for social networking, text messaging, and email every month. It was created with the intention of making it easier for entrepreneurs to post links on social media, attract clients, and sell their products or services. However, charlatans are increasingly employing Bitly URLs to disseminate fake information and increase traffic to their websites. Apparently, the message went viral on WhatsApp due to the conditions and instructions on the website. As shown in the screenshot above, the alleged website asks visitors to trade further information with other users before accessing the grant. Con artists frequently use this tactic to entice people to visit their websites. Our findings show the Nigerian government is not giving out N150,000 to N550,000 to Nigerian youth under the National Youth Empowerment Funds.",1
"Claim: A WhatsApp message alleged that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines and that American politician and anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won a lawsuit against pharmaceutical lobbyists. Verdict: False. Investigations reveal that this message, with numerous claims, has been circulating since 2021 and has been debunked multiple times. A WhatsApp message making rounds claims that the United States (US) Supreme Court ruled that COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines and that Robert Kennedy Jr. won a lawsuit against pharmaceutical lobbyists. The message includes the following statement: In its decision, the Supreme Court confirms that the damage caused by COVID mRNA gene therapies is IRREPARABLE. Since the Supreme Court is the highest in the US, there are no further appeals, and all avenues of appeal have been exhausted. The message also quotes Mr Kennedy: This success was only possible thanks to the international cooperation of a large number of lawyers and scientists. Of course, this ruling sets an international precedent. The message ends with a call to action, urging people to publicise the supposed ruling, Let us promote rebellion against the dirty and unpunished death business. For the good of our children and grandchildren, we must resist. A link purportedly supporting the claim is also included. Due to the claims potential to mislead, DUBAWA conducted a fact check. DUBAWA identified and verified four claims from the message. Claim 1 : COVID-19 vaccines are gene therapies that have caused damages This claim has been widely debunked . According to the Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care , mRNA vaccines are not gene therapies. They work by teaching the immune system to recognise and fight specific pathogens without altering genetic material. Reputable sources, FactCheck.org , the National Institute of Health , and Reuters confirm no evidence supports the assertion that mRNA vaccines have caused widespread harm. Verdict: False. Claim 2: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines. The U.S. Supreme Court has not issued any rulings declaring COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines or that they cause irreparable harm. A review of Supreme Court case records shows no evidence that such a case has been heard or decided. Verdict: False. Claim 3: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. won a lawsuit against pharmaceutical lobbyists. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has denied the statements attributed to him. In an interview with the Associated Press , Kennedy stated that the claim was fabricated. He clarified, The article about the Supreme Court is misinformation, adding that it has been repeatedly recycled online. Furthermore, no record exists of Kennedy filing or winning such a lawsuit in the Supreme Court. Verdict: False. Claim 4: A link provided verifies the claim The link in the forwarded message leads to an unrelated Fox News article discussing a 2022 New York State Supreme Court ruling that reinstated unvaccinated workers. The article does not address vaccine safety or involve the U.S. Supreme Court. Verdict: Misleading. The WhatsApp message contains multiple false claims and misrepresentations. Neither the U.S. Supreme Court nor Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has supported or made rulings or statements as alleged.",0
"Claim: Meta has started paying Threads users. Verdict: Misleading. Our findings showed that Meta has implemented a bonus programme enabling users to earn rewards through posting on Instagram and Threads. However, access to Threads bonus is currently by invitation only. Social media platforms have become bustling hubs of connection, self-expression, and financial opportunity. Recently, X (Twitter) made waves by rolling out a feature enabling users to monetise their posts. Following this development, rumours have emerged that other social media platforms are implementing the same strategy. For instance, Jumpmanjotman, a Thread user, shared a screenshot of over $6,000, allegedly paid to him by Threads. To emphasise his claim, he wrote threads payout is crazy. Threads is a new social messaging platform developed by Metas Instagram team. The application, which resembles X, allows users to share texts, videos, and images and join public discussions. Jumpmanjotmans post has stirred different reactions from other users. While a group doubted whether Threads has started paying users like X, others like Heyitslaurajane accused him of manipulating the screenshot shared. For instance, she wrote, Its not even the same font. Another user, Weidwad, supported her and claimed he could recreate the screenshot. He wrote, Cap, I could do the same things, just screenshot and edit. DUBAWA conducted this verification to clear the controversy emerging from the claim. In July 2023, Mark Zuckerberg, Meta CEO disclosed that the company may consider the monetisation of Thread. However, this would not happen until users have crossed a one billion target. As seen on Google Play Store, the app download has already crossed 100 million. The monetisation of X was global news. With Threads having similar prominence, it would not be strange to find both international and local news reports announcing the development. With that, DUBAWA conducted keyword research on Google to see recent news about Threads monetisation. In a recent development, several blogs have published Threads plans to introduce a bonus programme. This would allow users to make up to $1,500 by posting on Threads. Although DUBAWA confirmed this via Instagrams help centre, we noticed that Meta company solely determines the amount a user earns. This refuted the figures placed by bloggers. We also found that the programme is strictly by invitation and not open to all users. Also, no date was disclosed for its commencement. Below are two screenshots showing details of the bonus programme: While Meta has introduced a bonus programme that allows users to earn by posting on Instagram and Threads, access to the latter is strictly by invitation. The claim is misleading.",0

"The digital investigations manager at the Digital Technology Artificial Intelligence and Information Disorder Analysis Centre (DAIDAC), Silas Jonathan, revealed that terrorist groups actively use misinformation to expand their influence in the conflict-afflicted Lake Chad region in Africa. He disclosed this in a keynote session while addressing journalists at the three-day African Investigative Journalism Conference (AIJC2024) held from Oct. 30 to Nov. 1, 2024, in Johannesburg, South Africa. While speaking at the session-themed Terrorism in the Sahel, he stressed the importance of personal connection to statistics often cited in discussions about conflict. Each time this conversation is raised, its just numbers. You have to be able to imagine yourself in a crisis zone, he said. As a digital investigative journalist and researcher, Mr Jonathan focused on how information contributes to crises in the Lake Chad region. He said, One of the things I have pulled out is the economy of violence and the prioritisation of conflict. He pointed to state and non-state actors profiting from ongoing conflicts, citing instances where military officers perpetuate crises for personal gain. There is also a rising demand for immigration as people seek better opportunities, he added, noting that this has led to an economy centred around human trafficking. He highlighted the weakening democracy in the Sahel region as a significant factor contributing to instability. Historically, democracy has been questioned over its legitimacy to deal with terrorism, he explained. He pointed to external influences fuelling existing tensions, particularly from groups like Russias Wagner Group, which complicated the situation further. In his research on information disorder, Jonathan said that information is power that increases when misinforming the audience. Drawing parallels with historical events like the Rwandan genocide and Nazi propaganda, he explained how extremists are now using social media platforms to recruit new members. On Facebook and TikTok, there are groups managed by extremists promising better lives in exchange for allegiance, he noted. He also said that several studies beyond his organisation confirmed how misinformation could lead to panic within communities with vulnerable populations. Mr Jonathan also discussed demographic trends in social media engagement, stating that terror groups exploit such trends to exaggerate their influence. People are more likely to engage with narratives that evoke fear, he explained. He pointed out that communities can feel powerless after just one gunshot or alarming message spread through social media. He also noted that human trafficking remains another pressing issue connected to these crises. Jonathan shared a heart-wrenching story of a man whose brother left Nigeria for Europe to seek better opportunities but had not been heard from in six years. Although this is a particularly unique story, it tells of others who are desperate to leave the region, he said. Mr Jonathan called on journalists to counteract misinformation and effectively engage with these narratives. The conflict is moving from just the physical realm to the digital platform, he warned, urging journalists to explore new ways of addressing these challenges. He noted that recent protests in Nigeria, where demonstrators waved Russian flags and called for military governance, were indicative of shifting sentiments towards authoritarianism. In his conclusion, Jonathan said, Poverty has been a significant factor driving conflict in the Sahel. He emphasised the need to address poverty in the region.",1
"Claim: An X user claims that hair relaxers cause fibroids. Verdict: True. Research papers concerned with the matter have weighed in on the subject, stating that chemicals in relaxers increase the risk of having fibroid in women. Medical experts also observe that health conditions can be triggered by chemical properties embedded in relaxers. Fibroids, according to Healthline , are abnormal growths that develop in or on the uterus and can sometimes become large, causing severe abdominal pain and heavy periods, though in most cases, they cause no signs or symptoms. According to the United States National Institute of Health , uterine fibroids affect 20-25 per cent of women of reproductive age. By age 50, up to 80 per cent of black women and 70 per cent of white women develop fibroids. They are mostly common in women in their 40s and early 50s but can occur earlier. In her post, X user @Sugabelly advised her followers to discontinue using hair relaxers, claiming they can cause fibroid. Certain reactions under the posts validated the post, while others showed disbelief. A user, @waist-cuttie , commented, I have people that never relaxed their hair but still have fibroid; please explain. Another user, @nwaegbe-nkem , said, Is any researcher proving this? I stopped relaxing my hair before I did fibroid surgery, but they are back. Another user, @ebiblosky , supported the claim, saying, This one is common knowledge na (This is common knowledge). Those who have a history of fibroid or have had the surgery before should be cautious of relaxers. As of the time of the report, the post has garnered 248,000 views, 665 likes, 248 reposts, 55 comments, and 278 bookmarks. Due to the divergent opinions in the comment section, DUBAWA decided to verify the claim. There are different causes of fibroids. Hormones could cause fibroids. They are linked to the hormones estrogen and progesterone produced by the ovaries. These hormones stimulate the growth of the uterine lining during each menstrual cycle and are believed to promote the growth of fibroids. Another cause of fibroid could be genetic . Fibroids may run in families, indicating a genetic predisposition. Having a close relative with fibroid increases the risk of developing them. Other factors, such as being overweight or obese, experiencing early onset of menstruation, and late menopause, also have the potential to cause fibroids. According to a study highlighted by the Fibroid Institute Texas, it was stated that black women who frequently used chemical hair straighteners had a two to three times higher risk of developing fibroids. Another study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology also stated that hair relaxers may increase the risk of uterine fibroids. It stated that the chemicals in hair relaxers, such as ammonium thioglycolate and sodium hydroxide, can penetrate the skin through scalp lesions, potentially leading to fibroids. This is because the products in the relaxers often contain carcinogens and hormone disruptors like cyclosiloxanes , parabens and phthalates , which can be absorbed into the body through the scalp. These fibroids can cause severe health issues, including the need for hysterectomies. The article suggested that affected individuals should consult a doctor and consider legal action for compensation. Dr Henry Iwunze, a gynaecologist at Simone Hospital in Aba, explained in an interview with DUBAWA that it is plausible that hair relaxers could be linked to the development of fibroids. These relaxers contain various chemicals that can interact with the bodys normal hormones and enzymes, Dr Iwunze said. He added, The chemicals present in hair relaxers can have side effects, including the effect on the hair itself. Although one might argue that hair relaxers are applied externally and should not affect internal organs, it is important to consider that hormones and enzymes circulate throughout the body, allowing for potential interactions that could trigger certain conditions such as fibroid. Mr Qudus Lawal, a gynaecologist at Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo state, also told DUBAWA that he has never seen evidence supporting this connection throughout his medical experience. However, he acknowledged that hair relaxers contain chemicals that have been associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer, which is cancer of the womb. It is plausible that relaxers can present women with the risk of developing fibroids.",1
"Claim: An X user, @ mahbeel_A , claimed former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members have agreed to pick Bala Mohammed, the governor of Bauchi State, as the partys presidential flag-bearer in the 2027 general elections. Verdict: False! The former vice presidents spokesperson dismissed the claim as untrue. Additionally, the pictures attached to the post date back to 2022. Barely 18 months after the 2023 general elections, which ushered President Bola Tinubu into power, political permutations have already started for the 2027 elections. Recently, Mr Tinubu made headlines for saying he is not yet thinking about the 2027 elections but is focused on restructuring the economy to benefit the people. After his remark, prominent figures in the All Progressives Congress (APC) vowed to support his re-election in 2027. In another development, reports of a proposed alliance between Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Peter Obi of the Labour Party (LP) ahead of the countrys next general election are also gaining weight in some quarters. Mr Kwankwaso recently indicated his willingness to serve as Mr Obis running mate, which attracted criticism from the opposition. Amid the political calculations ongoing for the 2027 election, an X user who appeared to be a staunch supporter of the PDP claimed Mr Abubakar and his team have declared support for Bala Mohammed as the partys presidential candidate. The user attached pictures showing Mr Abubakar and Mr Mohammed, the incumbent governor of Bauchi State, in a friendly visit to portray the content of his post. Several X users have recently reshared the same pictures on Facebook with different narratives, as seen here and here . Due to the claims sensitivity and potential impact, DUBAWA decided to investigate it to ascertain its veracity. A quick reverse image search of the images the X user shared showed that they were taken as far back as 2022. The pictures were taken when Mr Mohammed and some stakeholders in the PDP paid a courtesy visit to Mr Abubakar. The pictures taken at the time were posted here , here , and here . Before the visit, there were unconfirmed reports that Mr Mohammed was planning to withdraw his support from Mr Abubakars presidential bid ahead of the 2023 elections. Therefore, the visit was to play down the rumours and establish that Mr Mohammed was behind Mr Abubakar, the PDP presidential candidate for the 2023 election. To verify the claim further, DUBAWA spoke with Paul Ibe, a spokesperson for Mr Abubakar, who described it as untrue. He explained that his principal was focused on settling the partys rifts, as opposed to the X users suggestion. Mr Ibe said the X user might have posted that as a clickbait and urged the public to disregard it. He also clarified that no such proposition had been discussed and added that Atikus team had yet to reach any conclusion on the matter as claimed. Some users on Twitter might be looking for clicks. You cannot be dependent on such information. He is in the process of trying to ensure that everybody is on the same page and unite the party. How can he talk about a candidate? It is just like saying a woman has given birth even when she has not yet conceived. It is ridiculous. I believe that what the leaders of the party are focused on is trying to see how they can mend all broken fences before talking about a candidate. He cannot have that kind of conversation now, as it will further polarise the party. Just discount that information, he said. The claim that Mr Abubakar and the PDP caucus have agreed to field Mr Mohammed as the PDP presidential candidate for the 2027 election is false. The pictures accompanying the claim have also been online since 2022.",0
"CLAIM: Grant support on Facebook claims that the World Trade Center (WTO), in partnership with Nigerias Federal Government (FG), is disbursing free N200,000 loans to business owners. Verdict: False! Our investigation reveals that the post was created to facilitate phishing attempts. No reputable media organisation reported the disbursement. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is a global institution that regulates trade between nations. Recently, Nigerian Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was reappointed as the Director-General(DG). This four-year term will begin in September 2025. Amidst this development, Grant Support, a Facebook Page, wrote that the WTO is giving Nigerians N200,000. The featured image on the post was designed using the face of the new WTO DG. The text in the image also noted that this loan was being disbursed in partnership with the Federal Government. World Trade Organization Grant, in partnership with the Federal Government of Nigeria. Apply now, secure non-refundable grants to help you expand your small or large scale business, the post reads. The post features a link accompanied by an Apply Now call-to-action. The image also includes Nigerias Coat of Arms and the WTO logo. As of Nov. 23, 2024, the post has generated over 2,800 likes, 3,100 comments, and 60 shares. Similar posts were also found on Facebook here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . The virality of the post and the severity of the informations implications for Ms Okonjo-Iwealas reputation as WTO Director-General prompted DUBAWA to verify the claim. Verification We clicked on the link attached to the post , which redirected us to a website called Webcraft. The website then redirected us again to a US visa sponsorship opportunity page. The page does not mention the loan application. It appears to be a phishing attempt designed to drive traffic to unrelated websites. We then conducted a keyword search to see if any reputable news organisation reported the loan disbursement but found nothing. Instead, we saw old news reports in March 2024 by Daily Trust that the WTO initiated a $1.2 million project on Nigerias agricultural exports. It was supported by the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF) to boost the countrys economy. We also went through the news segment of the WTO official page to see if we could find a report on it, but we could not. Our findings reveal that the post uses the image of the WTO Director-General to deceive users, as it is neither affiliated with the official WTO website nor its verified Facebook page. Scammers deliberately included Nigerias Coat of Arms as the cover photo and other logos in the post to lure unsuspecting Facebook users. Based on the investigation, the post is a clear phishing attempt to deceive users and drive traffic to unrelated websites. Using the WTO Director-Generals image, Nigerias Coat of Arms, and other official logos is a device to create false credibility.",0
"Claim: An X user, Morris Monye claims that Akpabio was praying inside Abuja National Mosque. Verdict: Misleading!

DUBAWA understands how misinformation can fuel religious violence, so we found it necessary to verify and establish the truth. Verification DUBAWA conducted a reverse image search on the image posted by the claimant using Google Lens and discovered media reports on the same image. According to a report , Senate President Godwills Akpabio was among the dignitaries who attended the wedding Fatiha of Senator Danjuma Gojes daughter on Friday, Oct. 25, 2024. Mr Goje is the senator representing Gombe Central and a former governor of Gombe state. The report shows that Fauziyya Danjuma Goje and Aliyu Ahmed Abubakars wedding Fatiha was held at the National Mosque, Abuja, after the two Rakaat Jumaat prayers. This shows that Akpabio entered the Mosque only to attend the wedding, after the prayer. In further research, we retrieved a YouTube video of Premium Times coverage of the event. We thoroughly examined it and found that Godswill Akpabio wasnt around throughout the two Rakaat Jumaat prayers but entered only after it was time for the wedding of Fatiha. The claim that Senator Godswill Akpabio was praying at Abuja National Mosque is misleading! Media reports show that the senate president was there for a wedding ceremony, not prayers.",0
"Claim: Ivory Coast loses four points in AFCON over misconduct. Verdict: False. Credible news outlets inform that photos of the Ivorian players in a brawl were taken during training before the World Cup qualifier against Tanzania in 2013. Ahead of the African Cup of Nations (AFCON) 2023, scheduled to commence on Saturday, Jan. 13, 2023, a Facebook user claimed that the host nation, Cte dIvoire, has lost points over pitch misconduct. The Facebook user, Ndifreke Heartbeat, wrote that Cote dIvoire had lost points due to its players involvement in a physical brawl, allegedly placing group mate, Nigeria, at the top spot in the group. Attached to the claim were images of two Ivorian players visibly locked in a fight as players and officials tried to separate them. The claim has generated over 40,000 likes, 2,100 comments and shared 455 times. There were diverse reactions in the comment section. So our pathway to qualification is (through) other people fighting? Simon Onyekachi Igbudu queried . Fake news. Henry Okwudiri dismissed . Due to the controversy generated and the sensitivity of the claim, DUBAWA decided to verify it. We conducted a keyword search related to the claim and found a news report published by Daily Mail . The 2013 news article reports how former Manchester City player Abdul Razak was sent home by the Ivory Coast for fighting with a teammate. The paper further informed that Mr Razak was punished for scrapping with Jean-Jacques Gosso, who played for the Turkish side Mersin dmanyurdu at the time. It was also reported that the incident had happened during a training session ahead of Ivory Coasts clash against Tanzania in the World Cup qualifiers. Notably, along with the publication were photos of the brawl taken by the American visual media company Getty Images. Manchester Evening News and Modern Ghana also reported that Ivory Coast had given Mr Razak a reprieve and sent him home after a face-off with Jean-Jacques Gosso on the training ground. The claim is false. Several news platforms report that the incident happened in 2013.",0
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message says Ecobank rewards its clients in the National Government with an $8000 subsidy. Verdict: Hoax! Ecobank-Liberia says, It is not running any subsidy reward scheme. Recently, a message has been circulating on WhatsApp saying that Ecobank is granting a subsidy worth $8000 to clients with the Ecobank National Government. Participants of the scheme must provide their knowledge about the bank and answer a few questions about themselves to be considered a winner of the financial scheme. DUBAWA checked the site to verify whether it was authentic or just a scam to dupe people of their money and/or their personal information. When clicked, the link of the message takes users to a questionnaire page, where it is indicated that through the questionnaire, you will have a chance to get $8000. Also, several commenters are seen giving testimonies of how they have been rewarded for partaking in the scheme. DUBAWA decided to verify the claim by clicking on the page and answering the questions about the age range, bank rating, and gender. Like several other scam sites, users are instructed to share the program with five WhatsApp groups or 20 WhatsApp friends to win an $8000 congratulatory prize that appears after answering the questions. After sharing, a complete registration form appeared where users were informed that it was the final step to getting the prize within five to seven days. Interestingly, a completely different site popped up, where users were asked for their personal information, including a passcode and phone number. This fact-checker scanned the site on scamdoc , a web tool that evaluates digital identities, and the analysis show ed that the site has a very bad trust index and the owner of the sites domain name is hidden. Although analysis from scamdoc doesnt influence the rating of a specific domain, this fact-checker, however, placed multiple calls to Ecobank-Liberia, requesting them to verify the claim being made on the site, after which they took to their official Facebook page to announce that the bank is not running any subsidy reward scheme and further cautioned people to avoid clicking any link requiring personal or bank details. The message circulating on WhatsApp that EcoBank is providing an $8000 reward scheme is a hoax. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship in partnership with The Stage Media Liberia, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: Dangote Refinery has just signed a supply deal worth $20 billion with Total Energies. Verdict: Misleading. While TotalEnergies signed a supply deal with Dangote Refinery, the investments worth is undisclosed. Also, the $20 billion mentioned in the report is not the supply deals worth but the refinerys. Discussions about the decline in Nigerias crude oil economy have intensified recently with Shell, a foremost oil industry company in the country for years, divesting its onshore subsidiary companies to a consortium of local companies. Amidst this, an X user, @Woye, posted on May 21, 2024, that Total Energies, a French energy conglomerate, has signed a $20 billion deal with Dangote to supply crude oil. Part of the post reads, TotalEnergies signed a deal with Dangote to supply crude oil of $20bn. Yes or No? Answer is YES. The claim is made in reaction to recent news about TotalEnergies investing $6 billion in an energy project in Angola over Nigeria. This post has generated over 95,000 views, 370 likes, and 125 reposts as of May 22, 2024. While supporting the statement, @OyedemiBabs, commented that the Federal Government should engage in stable economic policies to attract foreign investment, stating, @Woye please let FG not Tinubu do more about stable policies for more investors to come willingly. However, the comment section also featured counter-opinions. @CertifiedAnelka said, They said the refinery was built with an investment of $20b, but you said they signed a $20b deal. Another user, @Danicious_Dan, added, If you can carefully read the picture stating that the refinery investment is worth $20bn not that the deal with Dangote is $20bn. Given the claims controversy, DUBAWA initiated this fact-check to set the record straight. Keyword searches across credible sources revealed that although TotalEnergies signed a deal with the Dangote refinery, it was never a $20 billion deal. Further details about the deals actual worth have yet to be made public as of the time of filing this report. Cross-referencing reports by credible news agencies, we found that Dangote Refinery, commissioned in May 2023 but began production in January 2024, is a $20 billion investment by Africas richest man, Aliko Dangote. The Twitter user had misrepresented the refinerys invested value to describe the amount of its new deal with TotalEnergies. DUBAWA observed that he attached an image to his post, and we scoured online reports using search operators to generate the report. The poster coined his conclusion from the line, The refinery, which began production in January, was built with an investment of $20bn (N30.5trn), seen in the description given to the refinery by Offshore Technology . Based on our findings, the claim is misleading as the post links the worth of the money invested in building the refinery to a supply deal it signs with a company.",0
"Claim: Too much stress causes typhoid No. Stress does not cause typhoid as some Nigerians claim In Nigeria, it has become a common assumption that whenever a person is sick and diagnosed with typhoid, it is often attributed to stress and such a person would be advised to try to rest well. A Twitter user known as Code and vibes (@pharuc1) wrote that the stress from commuting from mainland Lagos to Island has made him sick with typhoid. He wrote, Abeg who dey work for Island wey dey ply Oshodi, Gbagada or Oworo? make i join am abeg, i dont mind paying monthly owo epo Just one week from mainland to island stress, full blown typhoid knocked me down. Another tweeter known as Oyindamola ( @portable_wendy1), who lamented of not being paid by her boss in a thread of tweets, narrated that she got down with typhoid as a result of the stress she went through having commuted from Sango-Ota, Ogun State to Yaba, Lagos State. Oyindamola wrote, On the 25th of September, I fell seriously ill & I was rushed to the hospital. After a series of tests; I was diagnosed with typhoid due to stress. I was going from Ota to Yaba every single day and my mum helped me with transport fare. Typhoid explained According to the popular medical news website, MedicalNewsToday, typhoid is a bacterial infection that can lead to a high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. It can be fatal. It is caused by the bacteria salmonella typhi. The infection is often passed on through contaminated food and drinking water, and it is more prevalent in places where handwashing is less frequent. It can also be passed on by carriers who do not know they carry the bacteria. In the same manner, webmd.com describes typhoid as an acute illness associated with fever caused by the salmonella enterica serotype typhi bacteria. It can also be caused by salmonella paratyphi, a related bacterium that usually causes a less severe illness. The bacteria are deposited in water or food by a human carrier and are then spread to other people in the area. According to Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine, typhoid incidence ranges from 3.9% to 18.6%. A gastroenterologist, Dr. Seyi Akande, explained in an interview with this fact-checker that typhoid is contracted when infected faeces contaminate the food, hand or drink of another person. According to him, the microorganism responsible for that typhoid known as salmonella gets into the body through the mouth and gets out through faeces. He explained, Salmonella typhi is a microorganism that is found in faeces. So, whenever you have an unhygienic condition there are chances of spread of typhoid. For instance, if the water is close to where the toilet is or people that are handling food go to the toilet and dont wash their hands. Or people that have long nails allow faeces and dirt to hide under the nails and use those hands to cook food then one can get infected by eating the food. That is why it is important to do typhoid tests for food handlers before you certify fit to offer food service. Anything that will make people ingest food or water that is contaminated through the mouth can lead to typhoid, even though it is not every time that people get down with the disease because the body has a general way of fighting these diseases. For instance, the stomach is acidic so this acidity kills a lot of these typhoid bacteria. But if they are many, some can escape this acidity and get to the small intestine then to the body. Unhygienic conditions lead to typhoid, Dr. Akande added. The gastroenterologist further explained that typhoid is diagnosed first and foremost by the symptoms the patient presents. If the patients have continuous fever, not the intermittent one. The intermittent fever can come in the morning and you dont see it again in the evening, that is common to malaria but the typhoid fever is continuous. Also, a person with typhoid will have headache, commonly they will have abdominal pain. Sometimes, they could have constipation or pass stool less frequently. They may also have diarrhea. Usually because we are dark skin, we might not easily see the rashes that typhoid causes but in those that are light skinned, you will suspect that a patient is having typhoid. Dr. Akande added, Then there are tests that you can then do. For instance, you can take blood samples of the patient and do salmonella typhi not that widal test. You can take the stool or urine of the patient depending on how long the patient has been having symptoms whether the first, second week, or whenever. Akande said that the foregoing question is one of the problems in Nigeria with the diagnosis of typhoid. He stated, We call some doctors malaria-typhoid doctors because once there is fever; they will think it is either malaria or typhoid. It is good to think of malaria because it is common in our community but it is not every fever that is typhoid. The notion that whenever you treat malaria and it doesnt go then you have typhoid is very wrong. In the same vein, Dr Tunji Akintade, a general physician and the immediate past president of the Lagos Chapter of the Association of General and Private Medical Practitioners of Nigeria, also corroborated his colleague that typhoid is an infection caused by bacteria called salmonella. He further explained that the signs and symptoms of this disease are fever(hotness of the body), severe headache, abdominal pain among others. Complications that can arise from it include intestinal perforation, psychosis and severe anaemia. All these(disease + complications) are stressor to the human body. Let me categorically state for educational purposes. Diagnosis of typhoid is both clinical and laboratory. The laboratory aspect of it is blood culture, not widal test, the medical practitioner explained. Akintade explained that the corresponding response will be based on clinical evidence seen. These responses may include further investigation or intervention which can be surgery, blood transfusion, or even all of the above. He said, prevention of this illness is basically water hygiene not drugs. Vaccines has also been useful. The doctor explained, Stress itself is defined as a state of mental or emotional strain or tension caused by adverse (physical, biological or chemical) circumstances. Stress on its own can easily be handled by identifying the stressor which like I said above can be biological, physical or chemical. Once you identify it, you remove it before it tampers with your emotional or mental state. Resting plays a major role in all stressor but it has to be in addition to removing the stressor. When you rest, you conserve energy, build up your immunity and your protein store and you get well hydrated. Akande empathetically said that stress does not in any way cause typhoid. He said, Typhoid is not caused by stress. Typhoid is caused by a biological organism called salmonella. It is the cause of typhoid that is a biological stressor. In the above subject matter, the cause of typhoid is biological (bacteria) triggering chemical and emotional circumstances. Typhoid is not caused by stress, rather it is caused by a microorganism known as salmonella typhi.

"They wanted you all dead for the sake of power. I resigned so that you could live, Nigerias former president Goodluck Jonathan supposedly told Nigerians. Thats according to posts circulating on Facebook in February 2025. One such post quotes Jonathan as saying: I was fighting for Nigerians, but Nigerians were fighting me. They wanted you all dead for the sake of power. I resigned so that you could live. They were not after me; they were after you. I just happened to be standing in their way. They knew I would bring Nigeria to global standards, so they fought me from all sides, dragging you into the depths of poverty. My love for you as Nigerians was beyond words. Nobodys political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian. The same claim can also be found here , here and here . Nigerias 2015 election In February 2025, US lawmaker Scott Perry claimed that the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) funded the activities of terror groups, including Boko Haram . The claim revived debates about the US governments interference in Nigerias 2015 presidential election. Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party lost the election to Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Some said Perrys claim proved that Barack Obama s administration helped the opposition defeat Jonathan, a claim the former Nigerian president made in his 2018 book My Transition Hours . They also pointed at the Obama administrations refusal to sell weapons to Jonathans government at the peak of the Boko Haram insurgency, Obamas associates consulting for the APC ahead of the election, and Obamas video urging Nigerians to vote for the next chapter in the countrys progress. The US ambassador in Nigeria, Richard Mills, has refuted Perrys claim that USAid funded Boko Haram. However, did Jonathan say those he was up against in 2015 wanted all Nigerians dead? We checked. No hint of the claim Jonathan was in the news multiple times in February 2025. We looked at his speeches at various public events in the past month and found no mention of the 2015 elections or the events leading to it. Considering Jonathans status and the popular notion that he was a victim of US interference in Nigerian politics, it would have been well reported in the media if he had made the statement attributed to him in the Facebook posts. We found no credible media report on this. The claim is false.",0
"Claim: A Twitter handle tweeted a claim that the education minister, Adamu Adamu, said the ongoing ASUU strike will be called off within the next one week. Our findings show no report of the statement accredited to the minister. The claim was also dismissed by the spokesperson for the education minister. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) rolled over its warning strike by 12 weeks in May , in order to resume negotiations and have the Nigerian government meet the Unions demands. The rollover strike took effect from May 9, a decision made after its National Executive Council meeting. Nigerian students have protested the strike and called on the parties involved to call off the strike for their future. Due to the impact of the strike and the perennial conversations surrounding the strike, some false information about resumption has recently been shared. A Twitter handle, ASUU News (@ASUUNews), shared a post with the claim that the education minister, Adamu Adamu, said the ongoing ASUU strike will be called off within the next one week, attaching a picture of the minister to the tweet. The post attracted over 4,000 likes, 1,000 retweets and 700 comments. A Twitter user, _lexa (@Alicefaluyi), a Nigerian student affected by the strike commented , Thank you jesus , apparently believing the post. Another user, YouFeelMe (@Aayomide9) in a doubtful manner r eplied Dont thank Jesus yet, you cant trust these people. Myriads of information on the existing strike have been on social media. Nigerian students who have been affected pay attention to this influx of information to know what is next for their future. Hence the need for DUBAWA to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA carried out a keyword search on the internet to verify this claim. We found that ASUU has made progress in its talks with the federal government. Also, we found a news article by Vanguard that ASUU currently awaits the reply of the federal government to the unions presentation. DUBAWA also found a news report by Business Day where the federal government said that the ASUU Strike is more complicated than Nigerians think. Meanwhile, another report showed the stance of ASUU on the strike. A news headline by Punch reads, We are not beggars, hunger wont force us to resume ASUU. None of these articles suggested a resumption as claimed. DUBAWA then reached out to the education ministers spokesperson, Mr. Ben Goong, for clarification. He said that the supposed statement accredited to the minister is fake news. Our findings show no report of the statement accredited to the education minister. The spokesperson of the minister also dismissed this claim as fake news. This claim is therefore false.",1

"RonaIdo guilty of AduItery in Iran and will receive 99 lashes, reads a post on Facebook. The post , dated 15 October 2023, features a video that has been viewed by over 11,000 people. Cristiano Ronaldo is a football player who plays in the Saudi Pro League. The 38-year-old forward was in Iran with his team Al Nassr for a match against Iranian club Persepolis in September. The visit saw Ronaldo meeting with Fatemeh Hamami , a physically challenged Iranian artist who has painted portraits of the footballer using her feet. Hamami posted several Instagram posts of the meeting, where Ronaldo can be seen hugging her and kissing her on the head, after he accepted the portraits and gave her a signed football jersey. Shariah is an interpretation of Islamic law practised in some countries, including Iran. The law provides guidelines on various aspects of life, including interactions between men and women. Punishing an offender with lashes from a cane is part of shariah. Similar posts can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .

"Claim: Liberians should be happy with the standard of living because poverty in Sierra Leone and Guinea is higher, a Liberian based in Paris has said. Verdict: Misleading! The latest data from the World Bank shows that Guinea has a lower national poverty rate than Liberia and Sierra Leone. However, Liberias poverty rate is also lower than Sierra Leones. Frank Gibson , a Liberian based in France on Thursday, Nov. 2, 2023, phoned in on the OK Morning Rush and provided reasons why Liberians should be grateful to the governing party for the countrys standard of living, which he said was slightly better than that of Sierra Leone and Guinea. Gibson indicated that more Sierra Leoneans and Guineans live below the $1 economic index than Liberians. He said it was unfortunate that people who are critical of President Weah will erroneously use the suffering of the ordinary people as a point to undermine his legacy even when the situation is worse elsewhere. Now if you get to Sierra Leone, there are 53.6% living below the $1. I am getting the data from the World Bank, said Gibson. What that means is that Liberia is better. His statement, made at 1:25 minutes of the programme, has become part of the ongoing debate in the public regarding the standard and economic well-being of the ordinary people ahead of the run-off Presidential and Legislative election in Liberia. If we come to Liberia, he added, there are better living conditions as opposed to countries like Sierra Leone and Guinea. Gibson: I was in these two countries recently, and I know this for a fact. Apart from being a regular caller, Frank Gibson is an influential supporter of the incumbent President with a commanding voice among some of Weahs support base back home in Liberia. Amidst his claim, DUBAWA has decided to verify whether 53.6% of Sierra Leoneans are living below $1 and to ascertain whether the situation is worse in Sierra Leone and Guinea in relation to Liberia. DUBAWA had to access the latest World Bank data on Sierra Leone and Guineas living conditions compared to Liberias. DUBAWA also had to ascertain the global poverty lines to understand the parameters better. To start with, DUBAWA found out that the new global poverty line has been revised from $1.9 per person per day to $2.15 per person per day since Sept. 2022. Therefore, any analysis using $1.9 as the benchmark may be misleading. The World Bank report on Sierra Leone mentioned that the countrys path towards poverty reduction was disrupted by factors, including Covid-19, which led to a decline in income. Consequently, the report said, Poverty is projected to increase to 44.2% in 2020 from 40.6% in 2019. Poverty in Sierra Leone has a strong spatial component, the W/B report added. While 60% of the rural population lives in poverty, 20% of the urban population is poor. According to the Banks data in 2018, the national poverty rate in Sierra Leone stands at 56.8% at $2.15 per person. The W/B data for Liberia says that at the National level, the poverty rate is 50.9% , with a poverty line of 2.15 per person per day. The UN World Food Program on Liberia mentioned: Poverty and hunger levels are high across the country and are particularly severe in Liberias rural areas, where 51% of the population lives. Some 83.8% of the population lives on less than $1.25 a day. As for Guinea, the W/B pegged the national level poverty rate at 43.70 with a poverty line of $2.15 per person per day. This is shown in the diagram below. Per the data assessed from the World Bank, it is clear that the poverty line is not $1 ($1.9) per person per day, as the claimant pointed out. While Frank Gibson is right about the fact that national level poverty in Sierra Leone is higher than that in Liberia which is 56.8% and 50.9%, respectively, it is clear from the data that Guinea has a lower national poverty rate, which stands at 43.70% as compared to Liberia. From the numbers gathered, it is inaccurate for anyone to suggest that the standard of living in Liberia is better than that of Guinea using the national poverty level by the World Bank. However, using the poverty line analysis, the standard of living in Liberia is indeed better than that in Sierra Leone.",1
"Claim: A Twitter user claimed that all UK-funded projects, including the FQE (Free Quality Education), has been immediately suspended by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). Verdict: False; UK High Commission said they had not made any such announcement. In the wake of the general elections in Sierra Leone, international bodies and missions which have been long-term partners to the country have repeatedly expressed major reservations about the credibility of some aspects of the June 24 general elections. Following those concerns, there have been claims about what some of those bodies might decide regarding consequences. A Twitter user, @Jeminatusesay, tweeted last week that all UK-funded projects, including the FQE, have been suspended by FCDO. @Jeminatu Sesays post has since been viewed by over 13,000 people and liked by more than 200 people as of Monday, July 24. The Department for International Development (DFID) and the Foreign & Commonwealth Office (FCO) merged a few years ago. British diplomats say the merger will allow the UK to blend diplomacy and development. UK-supported development programs across Africa and many parts of the world go through the FCDO. To verify this claim, DUBAWA checked the posts comment section to see whether any link was posted as the source of the information the user was sharing. Despite numerous questions about the source of the information, the user did not attach any link to validate the authenticity of the information posted. DUBAWA then contacted the British High Commission in Freetown to ascertain the claims veracity. In an email response on Monday, an official representing the commission said no announcement about any changes to the UKs development program in Sierra Leone had been made. The UK and Sierra Leone are close friends. We have put on record our concerns about aspects of the election process. We have made no announcements about changes to our development projects and programmes, the response from the British High Commission states. There is no evidence to support the claim made by @JeminatuSesay, and the UK High Commission has also said they have not made such pronouncements. Hence, the tweet is false.",1
"Former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo said the food blockage supposedly initiated by then federal commissioner for finance Obafemi Awolowo was key to ending the Nigerian civil war . This is according to a post on a public Facebook group with over 94,600 members . The post reads : Breaking News: Awolowos Food Blockade Was Key to Ending the War Igbo Soldiers Were Unstoppable Obasanjo. The claim can also be found here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of the report.) Nigerias eastern region seceded, declaring independence as the Republic of Biafra on 30 May 1967. This led to a civil war that ended in January 1970 and had a death toll estimated at between 500,000 and 3 million . The Biafrans were predominantly of the Igbo ethnic group. Obasanjo headed a commando division during the war. He later became military head of state of Nigeria from 1976 to 1979 and the countrys democratically elected president from 1999 to 2007 . Nigerian troops captured the coastal city of Port-Harcourt in May 1968 and blocked Biafras access to food and other relief materials. Its estimated that hundreds of thousands of Biafrans starved to death , including women and children. Awolowo was accused of masterminding the blockade. However, there is evidence that the leader of Biafra at the time, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu , refused to accept the Nigerian governments conditions for allowing the supplies. Did Obasanjo make public statements about the blockade and its impact on the civil war in 2025? We checked. No evidence of the claim On 20 February 2025, another former Nigerian military head of state Ibrahim Babangida launched his book A Journey in Service. Since then, Nigerians have debated historical events , including the civil war and the annulled 1993 presidential election. We found no evidence of the claim or a credible media report on Obasanjo speaking about the civil war. Its unlikely that such a claim by Obasanjo would go unreported by the media. The same claim generated much debate when it was made in the book There Was a Country by Chinua Achebe, published in 2012. The claim that Obasanjo made the statement about the blockade in 2025 is false. The false claim was also posted here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"In January 2020 , a Lagos based lawyer, Malcome Omirhobo, filed a suit before the Federal High Court against the Federal Government, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and others over Arabic inscription on Naira notes. The lawyer asked the court to absolve the CBN of the mandate to print and circulate Naira notes bearing Arabic inscriptions as a legal tender for a secular state that has English as its official language. Omirhobo is of the view that the presence of the Arabic inscriptions on the Naira notes contravened the provisions of section 10 and 55 of the Nigerian constitution and is in a bid to Islamize the Nigerian state. It is against this backdrop that a Nigeria-based Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), a group which claims to position itself as a human rights organization promoting, protecting, and projecting the rights of Muslims, made a couple of claims regarding the claims about the Bible and Arabic inscription on Naira currency. MURICs claims, projecting facts, mostly counters arguments of the lawyers and other people against the said Arabic inscription on Nigerias Naira. Mostly true Verification : According to Encyclopedia Britannica Al-Khwrizm, whose full name was Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm, (born c. 780 died c. 850), is a Muslim mathematician and astronomer whose major works introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into European mathematics. It also states that the hindu-Arabic numerals consisting of a set of 10 symbols 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 originated in India in the 6th or 7th century and were introduced to Europe through the writings of Middle Eastern mathematicians, especially al-Khwarizmi and al-Kindi, about the 12th century. Also, G J Toomer, in the Biography in Dictionary of Scientific Biography (New York 1970-1990) stated that it is likely enough that the decimal place-value system was a fairly recent arrival from India and that al-Khwrizms work was the first to expound it systematically. A quote attributed to Mohammad Kahn cited in the book The Muslim contribution to mathematics by A A alDaffa (London, 1978) states inter alia In the foremost rank of mathematicians of all time stands Al-Khwarizmi. He composed the oldest works on arithmetic and algebra..The work on arithmetic first introduced the Hindu numbers to Europe. A report from the 14th Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) Conference held in Uzbekistan in October 2020 also attributed the introduction of Arabic numerals to the West to Al-Khwarizmi. Conclusion: All the publications that attributed the Arabic numerals to Al-Khwarizmi stated that he introduced the numerals to the West and the European countries. None of them established the fact that it was invented by him. Interestingly enough, God is called Allah in the Arabic Bible, as quoted in the statement. True Verification : Encyclopedia Britannica states that Allah is the standard Arabic word for God and is used by Arabic-speaking Christians and Jews as well as by Muslims. According to the Encyclopedia it is believed that God described himself in the Arabic language as Allh. A website christiananswers.net in a post answering to why Arab Christians referred to God as Allah stated And what about the 10 to 12 million Arab Christians today? They have been calling God Allah in their Bibles, hymns, poems, writings, and worship for over nineteen centuries Also an Arabic Bible Outreach Ministry on its website clarified that the first-known translation of the Bible into Arabic, which took place in the 9th century, uses the word Allah for God and that Arab Christians were using the word Allah for God prior to the dawn of Islam. Similarly a post on Medium by Fatima Karim explaining the similarities between the Muslim and Christian Allah posited that If you pick up an Arabic Bible, you will see the word Allah being used where God is used in English. This is because Allah is a word in the Arabic language equivalent to the English word God with a capital G. Fatima used the visualisation below to support her assertion. Dubawa went ahead to download an Arabic Bible with English translation to verify further. In verse 11 of Mark Chapter 3, we see that You are the son of God! written in the English version is in quotes with an exclamation. Dubawa traced the exact quote with an exclamation to the Arabic version and saw that the Arabic writing for God is similar to what is seen in the visualisation made by FatimaKarim. Also in an audio Bible on YouTube , the reader is heard mentioning the word Allah while reading out loud the book of John. Conclusion: Several search results supported the claim that the Arabic Bible refers to God as Allah It was not even Nigerian Muslim leaders who brought the idea of Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria. The man who initiated it was a Christian, an Urhobo officer, by name General David Akpode Ejoor (rtd). He was the one who introduced the Arabic inscription and the Star emblem into the Nigeria Army crest, as quoted in the statement. Partially True Verification : A blog post on Urhobo Voice attributed the designing of the Army cap badge to David Ejoor while rendering him a tribute after his death in 2019 it read The officer who designed the Army Cap Badge and Rank insignias in 1962. Also, David Ejoor in page 16 of his book Reminiscences stated that the idea behind the Arabic inscription and star emblem introduced into the Nigerian cap badge was for Defence and Unity, which are part of what the Nigerian Army stands for to defend the unity and integrity of Nigeria. In page 16 of the book, Ejoor wrote, In seeking a new design, I was anxious that the symbol should reflect the duty of the army and should be capable of inspiring officers and men. As I searched, I remembered the battle between the British and the Sokoto forces in 1903. At that battle, the Sokoto forces had carried the Sultans flag with an Arabic inscription on it. That Arabic inscription I learnt meant, VICTORY IS FROM GOD ALONE. However, submission by the CBN in response to the suit by the Lagos-based lawyer did not support the claim that David Ejoor initiated the Arabic inscription on the Naira. CBN noted that the inscriptions on the naira notes dates back to the colonial era. The CBN explained that the naira notes retained the inscriptions with Ajami since 1973 when the name of the Nigerian currency was changed to naira from pounds. The Ajami was inscribed on the countrys currency by the colonialists to aid those without Western education in certain parts of the country, who, back then, constituted a larger part of the populace. Also, a New Yorker report reiterates this assertion. In the report by Caelainn Hogan, the reporter interviews an archivist who says the Arabic script, had been printed on nearly every note since the naira was introduced, in 1973, and on previous currency as well. The archivist was able to show this reporter a piece minted in 1945 as evidence that the British pounds used in Nigeria during the colonial era prior to the advent of the Naira had Arabic inscriptions on them. To further verify this claim, Dubawa reached out to a PhD student of African History at the Michigan State University, Ozibo Ozibo. He could not confirm that it was General David Akpode Ejoor (Rtd) that brought the idea of the Arabic in the Nigerian currency in post-independence Nigeria but he, however, provided pictorial evidence that showed the Arabic inscription was on the British Pound used in Nigeria during the colonial era. Conclusion : Apart from his book where he tried to document history, no other strong indications point to that fact that it was Ejoor who introduced the Arabic writing into the Army cap badge. However, while there was some evidence to show that David Ejoor introduced the Arabic inscription on the Nigeria cap badge, several searches did not return results that show he was the one that introduced it into the Nigerian currency. Many of those saddled with the task of uniting us have become instruments of division. Ex-President Jonathan is an example. He removed Arabic from the naira because he listened to hate preachers whom he took along on his futile but numerous trips to Jerusalem, as quoted in the statement. Misleading Verification : An observation of the Nigerian Naira notes show that the Arabic inscriptions are only absent in the 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Naira denominations of the Naira while the 200, 500 and 1000 Naira notes still have the Arabic inscriptions. Also, reports show that it was only the Arabic inscription on the 100 Naira note that was removed under Goodluck Jonathan s administration when the note was redesigned by the CBN to commemorate 100 years of Nigerias amalgamation. However, the Arabic inscriptions in the 5, 10, 20, 50 Naira notes were removed during the regime of President Olusegun Obasanjo and not under President Goodluck Jonathan. Meanwhile, the Naira is regarded as Nigerias monetary unit; it is the official currency for the Federal Republic of Nigeria and is divided into 100 Kobos. It was introduced in 1973 to replace the British pound which was in use during the colonial era. The CBN has the sole authority to issue banknotes and coins. Coin denominations range from 50 kobo to 2 naira while Banknotes are denominated in values from five to 1000 Naira. If the Naira is an official legal tender that encompasses all denominations of the Nigerian currency, it cannot be said that Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic inscriptions from the Naira because the 100 Naira banknote is not the only Nigerian Naira. Conclusion : It cannot be said that ex-president Goodluck Jonathan removed Arabic from the Naira when there are still Nigerian currencies bearing the Arabic inscription. This claim is therefore misleading.

"Claim: Numerous social media users claim that the tickets for new buses will last for 12 hours. Verdict: False. The company running the bus and the project spokesperson said the tickets are valid for one ride. Freetown has a huge demand for public transportation, given that the city has over 2 million residents. This demand means the government and private players constantly find ways to improve public transportation. In 2019, a $50 million World Bank project the Integrated Resilient Urban Mobility Project, expanded some roads and did several other engineering works on footpaths and other transport infrastructure across Freetown. The project culminated in purchasing 50 buses, 47 of which started running on Tuesday, Jan 30, carrying passengers on a free pilot ride to their destinations. The pilot of the buses has been controversial because the Ministry of Transport designated a particular route for them while blocking other private commercial transportation from using them. A private company, Metro Transport, runs the buses. On Wednesday, Jan 31, several posts emerged on social media with people claiming that the bus tickets would last for 12 hours. The claim has generated a lot of excitement from users and scepticism from others. The buses have been running for free from Jan 30 and will continue until Feb 1, after which commuters must pay for each ride. The ticket cost is Le10 ($0.80) for a single ride, and there has been a lot of public debate about it. The standard price for transportation from one distance to another within the city is Le6. Twitter user @FrancisTuray8 claimed on his X account that people can use the ticket for 12 hours so people can go to school, the market, and other places within the supposed 12-hour valid period. His X post had been viewed more than 4000 times but has since been deleted after a backlash from some readers. The same claim also appeared on Facebook, with Lux Liberite Lavish stating that the ticket was valid for a day. The assertion has also been widely shared on WhatsApp. To verify this, DUBAWA spoke to two people in charge of arranging the buses. The companys Secretary General is running the buses, Thomas Barnett, and the spokesperson for the IRUMP project that bought the buses, Batu Shamel. Batu Shamel said: It is not true; the tickets are valid for one ride, that is, from one distance to another. She said they are developing a Q&A to answer many of these concerns. Barnett also told DUBAWA, That is not true, its a single-ride ticket. Somebody just wrote on social media that it lasts for 12 hours. After speaking to sources that have direct knowledge about the running of the buses, the verdict on this claim is false.",1
"CLAIM: Onitsha is the 3rd most populated city in Africa after Lagos and Cairo . The claim that Onitsha is the third most populated city in Africa is FALSE as the city is not among the top five most populated Nigerian cities in 2021. Africa is a continent that is rapidly expanding in terms of population, and this is reflected most clearly in its various sprawling urban populations. Nigeria, with some notable large cities, is the 7th most populated country in the world. A Twitter user Arum na-aso mkpali gwoo gwoo (@AfamDeluxo), on Wednesday, July 14, 2021, made a claim in a tweet that Onitsha in Anambra State, South-East Nigeria is the most populated city in Africa, after Lagos and Cairo. He stated that the Northern population is a myth and that landmass does not equal human beings. He concluded the tweet by writing. Festus Odumegwu who is the former chairman of National Population Commission uncovered the claim and wanted to fix it, but a former governor of Kano state, Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso and other Northern leaders fought him endlessly and made sure he was sacked. Screenshot of the tweets The tweet in less than 24 hours garnered a total of 1, 123 likes, 599 retweets and 33 quoted tweets. One of those who saw the tweet posted a comment agreeing with the post, I thought we all know this? . exactly why they have been posing Kano (their headquarter for rigging elections) as the most populous after Lagos. Screenshot of some comments affirming the claim Dubawa began its verification with a simple Google search engine to find out the most populous city in Africa. A post on the world population review recorded the current world population estimate in June 2019 to be 7,577,130,400 people, which far exceeds the world population of 7.2 billion in 2015. Further search on world population review shows that Cairo , the capital of Egypt, was adjudged the largest city in Africa with the 2021 population now estimated at 21,322,750. Screenshot of Cairos population from 1950 Second is Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with a 2021 population now estimated at 14,970,460. Screenshot of Kinshasa estimated population It further stated that the estimate represents the Urban agglomeration of Kinshasa, which typically includes Kinshasas population in addition to adjacent suburban areas. Nigerias economic capital city of Lagos was listed as the third-largest city in Africa, with a population now estimated at 14,862,111. The population estimates and projections come from the latest revision of the UN World Urbanization Prospects. Further findings also revealed that Onitsha is not even among the top five most populated Nigerian cities in 2021, with Lagos taking the lead followed by Kano with a population of 4,103,015, Ibadan has 3,649,023, Abuja has 3,464,123, closely followed by Port Harcourt with 3,171,076 while Benin City has 1,781,999. The city of Onitsha is the seventh most populous city in the country with 1,482,971. The total surface area of Nigeria is approximately 923,768 square kilometres. In combination with the over 200-million-person population, the density of Nigeria is around 212.04 individuals per sq km. Nigeria also has the highest population of any African nation, and much of this population resides in the south and southwestern area. Screenshot of Current Nigeria Population estimates Given the evidence available, the claim that Onitsha is the third-largest city in Africa is FALSE and Misleading.

"Claim: A viral WhatsApp voice note, purportedly made by the director and CEO of WhatsApp, claims users will have to start paying for WhatsApp services. The viral WhatsApp voice note claim is a hoax. The content is not new and has been circulated as a broadcast message several times in the past. On Monday, October 11, 2021, a WhatsApp voice note, purportedly made by the director of WhatsApp, Varun Pulyani, and the CEO of WhatsApp, Jim Balsamic, started circulating. In the voice note, a robotic voice could be heard asking users to forward the audio to 20 contacts and that failure to do so would result in paying for WhatsApp services. The audio is making the rounds a few days after Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger suffered outages that made their services inaccessible for about six hours. According to the audio which has been forwarded many times, WhatsApp is now being controlled by Mark Zuckerberg; hence, users need to forward the message to at least 20 contacts and their WhatsApp logo will change to a new icon with facebooks f within 24 hours. The voice said: This message is to inform all of our users, our servers have recently been very congested, so we are asking you to help us solve this problem. We require our active users to forward this message to each of the people in your contact list to confirm our active users using WhatsApp, if you do not send this message to all your contacts WhatsApp will then start to charge you. Your account will remain inactive with the consequence of losing all your contacts. It further said: Message from Jim Balsamic (CEO of Whatsapp ) we have had an over usage of user names on whatsapp Messenger. We are requesting all users to forward this message to their entire contact list. If you do not forward this message, we will take it as your account is invalid and it will be deleted within the next 48 hours. Please DO NOT ignore this message or whatsapp will no longer recognise your activation. If you wish to re-activate your account after it has been deleted, a charge of 25.00 will be added to your monthly bill. We are also aware of the issue involving the pictures updates not showing. Dubawa started by conducting a keyword search and found that the information is not new and has been circulated several times as a WhatsApp message but not as a voice note. Further checks also revealed that Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 from Jan Koum and Brian Acton who are the founders of WhatsApp, not by Varun Pulyani or Jim Balsamic. Also, there has been no changes in the WhatsApp logo since it joined Facebook in 2014. In January 2012, WhatsApp addressed the claim: Message from Jim Balsamic (CEO of Whatsapp) we have had an over usage of user names on whatsapp Messenger. We are requesting all users to forward this message to their entire contact list. If you do not forward this message, we will take it as your account is invalid and it will be deleted within the next 48 hours.

"CLAIM: The Congolese army, FARDC, deployed its forces to attack the protesting civilians of Goma. VERDICT: TRUE . Credible news outlets reported the incident, and the international news network Aljazeera confirmed the circulating video to be true. A Facebook handle, identified as Perspective Kantangaise, posted a video clip of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (FARDC) being responsible for the mass killings of civilians in Goma, a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eyewitnesses on the ground have described a terrifying scene, where the army, instead of battling with the rebels in the mountains, as intended, has resulted into indiscriminately shooting at anyone they encounter on the road, a part of the video reported. In the almost two-minute video, military trucks and an attendant of soldiers are seen manning roads and streets. However, it remains to be determined whether the individual bodies that the soldiers are seen collecting from different corners of the streets and piling up in their trucks are victims of their battery discharge. The clip further explains that the situation has left the residents in fear, and the absence of any significant response from any international human rights organisation and political superpowers has only added to the distress of the affected locals. The video further bolsters its claim, stating that many have now criticised the military assault in what has been seen as an egregious violation of human rights. The clip also highlights previous reports that the FARDC has been the primary violator of human rights within the notoriously unstable country. The military rampage only reinforces that perception as the army seems to be acting with impunity and without regard for its citizens, the video clip determined . The clip garnered 477 views, 17 likes, and two comments and was shared 16 times as of Tuesday, September 5, 2023. Due to the seriousness of the claim, we decided to check for its authenticity. We conducted a keyword search, leading to several related news publications, including one by Human Rights Watch . The Human Rights Watch informed that Congolese security forces shot and killed dozens of protesters. The report revealed that this happened in Goma on August 30, 2023. We further linked the details in the report with another keyword search and found a news report by the Associated Press (AP). We are informed of a clash between the Congolese armed forces and members of a religious sect, protesting Western Organisation and killing at least 26 people, part of the report reads. The report also stated that violence broke out on Wednesday in the eastern city of Goma where Wazalendo followers the religious sector, despite being banned by the city mayor, had still come out against a U.N. peacekeeping mission and other international organisations. However, we wanted to be sure that the video portrayed scenes of Congolese soldiers collecting bodies of civilians that they killed is true, so we decided to do a keyword search related to any video of that kind. We came across a similar video posted on Al Jazeeras YouTube Channel , where we saw scenes bearing the same cinematic characteristics as the version posted by the claimant. In the video , Al Jazeera reports they are believed to be the bodies of people killed in a crackdown by the DRCs military against anti-UN demonstration. The claim is true. News reports from credible news outlets and a verified video clip shared by Al Jazeera attest to the claims authenticity.",1
"Claim: Multiple social media users claimed that a Nigeria Customs Service officer in a recent viral video is one of the repentant bandits recruited into the security forces in the country. The claim that repentant bandits are being recruited into the Nigerian Army and other security forces is spurious and misleading. The people in the two photos are entirely different. Nwaiwu Chiukwuebuka, a Facebook user, in a post on Saturday, October 16, had shared pictures of a Nigeria Customs Service officer and that of a supposedly repentant bandit. According to him, the officer is one of the repentant bandits recruited to a significant security force in the country. He also raised an alarm that members of Boko Haram are being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies. Chiukwuebuka, whose Facebook bio reads Protest writer and a patriotic unapologetic Biafran, wrote: From Bandit to Nigeria custom Officer, same way Boko Haram is being recruited into the Nigeria Army, Nigeria Police and other Nigeria security bodies. The post, spurious as it appears, was widely shared, with 344 reshares and 24 reactions amassed as of Tuesday, October 19. Using the Crowdtangle web extension, a further check showed that another Facebook user with over 22,000 followers, Chinasa, Nworu, shared the picture. Nworu, whose Facebook profile showed that he works at Radio Biafra, shared the post on October 16, and it amassed 2,100 shares, 126 comments and 294 reactions. In the same vein on Twitter, a user with username @hashtag2weet with over 6,000 followers also shared the picture on Sunday, October 17. Findings by Dubawa also revealed that many WhatsApp users have re-shared the photo. Banditry, over recent times, has presented itself in forms of organised crimes including kidnapping, cattle rustling, mass abduction, arson, and armed robbery. The security record in Nigeria showed that it began as a farmer-herder crisis in some states in northeast Nigeria like Zamfara, Katsina and Kaduna, where it was first treated as a local affair. Triggered by poverty and a break of leadership trust, banditry in Nigeria has festered into what appears like full-blown terrorism, with its activities climaxed by the recent shooting of a military fighter jet . According to ACAPS , a non-profit, non-governmental project providing international, independent humanitarian analysis, between March 2020 and June 2021, over 1,400 students and staff have been kidnapped in several school abductions reported in northwest Nigeria. These abductions took place in Kankara and Mahuta (Katsina state), Kagara and Tegina (Niger state), Jangebe and Maradun (Zamfara state), Mando, Afaka, and Kasarami (Kaduna state), and Birnin Yauri (Kebbi state). State and federal governments have been taking some bold steps to eradicate banditry, including a special package for repentant bandits. Like Operation Safe Corridor (OSC), Nigerias de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme for repentant Boko Haram members and bandits are promised a huge reward if they surrender their arms. In February 2021, Auwalu Daudawa , a bandit leader who masterminded the kidnapping of schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina, surrendered over 22 weapons, including sophisticated AK-47 rifles. Daudawa dropped his arms for the operative from the Zamfara police command alongside other bandits. However, he later returned to the forest to continue banditry, having been allegedly dissatisfied by the promise made to him by the government. He was tragically killed during a gun duel with a rival gang at Dumburum forest located between Zurmi local government in Zamfara and Batsari local government in Katsina. Before that, in January 2021, seven notorious bandits said they had repented and surrendered their weapons to the Zamfara state government. They offered 14 weapons including AK 47 rifles. In April 2021, the Katsina police command said four bandits voluntarily surrendered their weapons including AK-47 rifles. Although the suspicious surrender of bandits has been described as a leap forward in the battle against banditry, many people believe that these blood-craving criminals including Boko haram terrorists are being given a soft landing despite their documented numerous atrocities. The government officials colourful media parade of repentant bandits, coupled with the privileges they enjoy after dropping their weapons have since created a conspiracy theory that often lead to a whirlpool of debates on whether these criminals are being recruited into the major security forces in the country. On Thursday, September 2, the Nigerian Army announced that almost 6,000 ex-terrorists had surrendered to the government. But before the announcement, specifically in 2019, General Abdulmalik Biu, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 7 Division, urged terrorists to lay down their arms. Biu said a repentant terrorist stands to be a president of this country ; he stands to aspire to any position in this country. This statement created a fuss and fuelled the conspiracy theory about repentant terrorists being recruited into the Nigerian Army. In several defences in the past, the military force had debunked the recruitment claim and described it as false and misleading, laced with mediocrity emanating from a poorly researched and uninformed position. Claim 1: Are Boko Haram and bandits being recruited into the Nigerian Army? Although there are unintelligible claims that repentant bandits and Boko Haram terrorists are getting recruited into the security forces in the country, findings by Dubawa showed that they are just products of febrile imaginations of some people and mere conspiracy theories. There is no record to back it up! In December 2019, the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) dismissed the alleged recruitment of deredicalised Boko Haram ex-fighters into the Nigerian military. Onyema Nwachukwu, the acting director of defence information emphasized in a statement that contrary to claims, no Boko Haram ex-fighter has been recruited into the Nigerian military and no such plan is in the offing. The de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration programme is a Federal Government programme conducted under the auspices of Operation Safe Corridor as a non-kinetic operation, he added. Similarly in August 2021, the Nigerian Army also denied that it was recruiting ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits into the force. For the avoidance of doubt, the NA does not have any repentant terrorists joining its ranks and does not have any plan for that. There are teaming able-bodied Nigerians that are willing to join the NA and genuinely help in the fight against terrorism and other violent crimes, Brig-Gen Onyema Nwachukwu, director, Army public relations, said. Meanwhile, there are records that some repentant ex-terrorists are being reintegrated back into the society. In May 2021, Nigerian Military announced that 603 repentant Boko Haram terrorists who have been rehabilitated would be reintegrated into the society in June. Claim 2: Is the Nigerian Customs Service officer in a recent viral video a repentant bandit? Verifying this claim, Dubawa ran a Yandex reverse image separately for the two collaged photos. The first Yandex search showed Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina state posing with some bandits who surrendered their arms . The second picture, a screenshot, was taken from a recent viral video of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) officer hilariously saluting his superior. The original video is found on The Punch newsp a pers Instagram page, and Nollywood actor Victor Osuagwus IG handle . A further search by Dubawa in respect to the first image showed that between 2019 and 2020, Governor Masari of Katsina, in a bid to lure errant youths out of banditry, met with some leaders of banditry who came to surrender their weapons. In a report contained in Leadership newspaper , the Katsina governor was reported to have presided over the states security council meeting with repentant bandits and others specifically dedicated to the contentious issues of banditry and kidnapping. In November 2020, Masari was reported to have received two repentant bandit leaders named Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji at the Government House in Katsina. Dubawa used an InVIDs Keyframe tool to analyse the video where the second image was taken. The result broke the footage into six frames, showing each image clearly. The fourth frame from the result above, which looks like the one being shared in the claim, was subjected to Magnifier image analysis. Again, results showed no facial resemblance (nose, mouth and eye) between the repentant bandit and Customs operative mischievously shared as the same person. The two pictures being shared are different and the claim surrounding them is false and highly misleading. Besides, no record showed that ex-Boko Haram fighters and bandits are being recruited into the Nigerian Army.

"Claim: A sponsored advert from an Instagram account claimed that the Central Bank of Nigeria has sued Kadaria Ahmed, founder of Daria Media, over an alleged interview with News Central TV. Verdict: FALSE. DUBAWAs findings revealed that such an interview did not hold, let alone spur a legal battle between the apex bank and the veteran journalist. Also, the supposed publication in the Vanguard newspaper is fake. An Instagram page, Stoney Transit Homes, made a sponsored post on Dec. 18, 2024, with a featured image designed like a report from the Vanguard newspaper. The supposed headline read, Kadaria Ahmed didnt know the microphone was on. We say goodbye to him forever. This is a sad day for all of Nigeria. When we clicked on the attached link, it displayed another page with the headline, Central Bank of Nigeria sues Kadaria Ahmed over statements she made on live television, indicating an alleged legal feud between the revered media icon and Nigerias apex bank. DUBAWA attempted to click on the page for more information, but the sponsored post is not connected to any page. We searched for Stoney Transit Homes on Instagram but got no results. As of Jan. 20, 2025, seven comments were seen on the pages comment section, all indicating that the page and post are malicious. However, a popular Nigerian blog, BaseTVreport, published the claim. The severity of the informations implications for Ms Ahmeds reputation prompted DUBAWA to verify the claim. We clicked on the link to the designed Vanguard newspaper website and discovered the features of the report differed from the original Vanguard publications. We validated our findings using a report titled Positive Signals for Healthcare, by Dakuku Peterside, published on Jan. 7, 2025. Original Vanguard publications had their logo at the top left corner of the page layout, compared to the fake link, which placed the logo at the top centre. Also, the Vanguard page layout contains the publication date, news, and their social media accounts represented by the symbols on the pages lefthand side. Also, the righthand side displays the latest published news but these features were absent in the fake link. We proceeded to identify the different font and page designs used in both instances. While Vanguard newspaper uses font colour code #3A3A39 and size 22 of the Cardiff typeface for the headline, the fake page used colour code #2A303B and size 32 of the Georgia typeface. The fake links copy claimed News Central TV conducted the interview allegedly between Ms Ahmed and Rabiu Kwankwaso, Kano states former governor. We used Google Lens to trace the source of the image in the link to a Facebook post made by Mr Kwankwaso on Nov. 19, 2022. On the day, he was invited as the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) presidential candidate to the Candidates Presidential Town Hall. In this media interactive series, Ms Ahmed interviewed presidential candidates ahead of the 2023 election in Nigeria. Throughout the interview , the speakers did not advertise the money-doubling platform. DUBAWA went through the transcript of the supposed interview on the website and noticed it was portrayed as if Ms Ahmed vouched for a trading platform called ParagonixPrimeX . When we clicked the Vanguard logo on the website, it redirected users to the ParagonPrimeX platform. We could not find evidence of any litigation against Ms Ahmed on the Central Bank of Nigeria s website and social media accounts. DUBAWA also checked through Vanguard newspaper and other credible media organisations since Dec. 18, 2024, and found no news about such an incident. There is no record of Nigerias Central Bank suing Kadaria Ahmed over an interview published in Vanguard newspaper. The interview is fake, and the claim is a mischievous attempt to promote a phoney trading platform named ParagonPrimeX.",0
"Claim: A video uploaded on YouTube claims that Dr. Isa Pantami, the minister of communications has been sacked by President Buhari. The claim that Dr. Isa Pantami, the minister of communications, has been sacked by President Buhari is false. The claim is a case of misleading headline with baseless content. Currently, both the presidents and Pantamis aides have discredited the claim as false. A video on YouTube shared on April 20th, 2021 claims that Dr. Isa Pantami, the minister of communication, has been sacked by President Buhari. Dr. Pantami, who has been under fire over acclaimed extremist comments he has made in the past, has also been the subject of discussion in recent times. As some call for his resignation, others are of the contrary opinion. It is in line with these ongoing happenings that a video , shared by a YouTube channel (Independent TV 7) purports that the minister has been sacked by president Buhari. The video has attracted over 290 views within 48 hours of its appearance. This may in part be because of the dashing headline that was tagged to the video: Breaking News!! BUHARI Order The Sack Of Isa PANTAMI And Been Kicked Out First, DUBAWA uncovered that there was no news story anywhere online, particularly from credible media outlets, that relates to Pantamis sack, aside from the claim. Furthermore, the narrative in the video turned out to be redundant, as nowhere was it stated in the eight-minutes video that the minister had been sacked. The headline was merely a hooker that was neither mentioned in the video nor clearly expressed or specified in the video. When DUBAWA reached out to Ms. Uwa Suleiman, the spokesperson to the Minister of Communications, she clarified in a phone conversation that the claim is false. This is not true, please disregard, she said. In the same vein, the Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, also confirmed that the claim is totally untrue. This is not the first time DUBAWA has come across misleading headlines with unrelated content, such as in this case. Though multiple controversies have been looming around the minister of communication and digital economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, President Mohammed Buhari has not sacked him. Therefore, the claim, as depicted in the headline of the Youtube video is false; it is a case of misleading headline and baseless content.",0
"Claim: The Liberia National Police shot a boy in the Rehab community, an online news media alleged. Verdict: Misleading! The published photo of the boy with multiple gunshot wounds is named Kennedy Onyango. He is from Kenya, not Liberia. As part of its usual operations of raiding criminals in the country, the Liberia Drugs Enforcement Agency (LDEA), alongside the Liberia National Police (LNP), carried out its operations in the Rehab community of Paynesville City. However, what was to be an operation of arrest and confiscation of drugs turned out to be a scene of the discharge of live bullets by the LNP, resulting in the death of a teenage boy, James Kandy, an online platform in Liberia reported. The Liberia Online Media (LOM) made a post with two images, with one of the images displaying a boy with more than seven gunshot wounds in the back, while the other is a boy with one gunshot wound in the chest. They alleged that the LNP had shot a teenage boy in the Rehab community. One of the gruesome images shared was a boy believed to be Kennedy, with more than seven gunshot wounds on his back. As of this publication, the post attracted 11 shares, 15 reactions and 8 comments. The disturbing image triggered DUBAWA to verify the accuracy of the post. DUBAWA contacted the family of the late James Kandy and one of his elder brothers, identified as Morris Boetee, confirmed that the image of the boy with one gunshot wound in the chest is his brother, James. He, however, clarified that the image of the boy with multiple gunshot wounds is not his brother, saying his brother did not sustain those multiple gunshot wounds in his back, as displayed in the second image. DUBAWA ran the viral photo on Google Images and found that the image with the multiple gunshot wounds is not James Kandy as claimed by the online media. Rather, reports suggest the 12-year-old boy in the picture is Kennedy Onyango from Kenya, as can be seen here , here , here , and here . The viral image of a boy with multiple gun wounds is from Kenya, not Liberia.",1
"Several Facebook users have claimed that the Nigerian government has decided to pay the new minimum monthly wage from the rank of private soldier to corporal in the Nigerian army. A post on 25 July 2024 reads: Federal Government have decided to pay minimum wage from the rank of private soldier to corporal in Nigeria ARMY, breaking news. The post includes an image of Nigerian president Bola Tinubu , presumably to make it appear more official. The Nigerian army rank is divided into commissioned and non-commissioned officers (NCO) in different ranks. The NCO ranks include recruit, private, lance corporal, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant, warrant officer, master warrant officer and army warrant officer. On 29 July , Nigerias new minimum monthly wage increased from N30,000 to N70,000 after protests from the Nigeria Labour Congress . The new minimum wage is more than double the previous figure and the change applies to both public and private sector workers nationwide. Similar posts can be found here , here , here and here . Social media users have claimed that the salary increase to meet the minimum wage law will be limited to certain ranks in the Nigerian army. Is this true? We checked. Fake news says defence ministry Only paying certain ranks in the army the new minimum monthly wage could raise eyebrows and charges of discrimination. There have been no reports of this from any credible media source . Such news would have made headlines. Africa Check visited the website of the Ministry of Defence of Nigeria. We found no reports that some ranks would be excluded from the new minimum wage. We did find that the defence ministry took to its official X account on 12 August to warn the public that the claim was fake. FAKE NEWS: Kindly disregard this and any related story, the ministry tweeted .",0
"Claim: Hushpuppi has been released from prison. Verdict: The claim is false. Hushpuppi is still serving his jail term at a US correctional facility. The picture used to depict his return is old. In November 2022, the United States District Court sentenced Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, to 135 months in the US Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) Fort Dix, New Jersey facility. This was after he pleaded guilty to a multimillion-dollar fraud charge, which he jointly executed. Before his arrest in 2020, he was a famous Nigerian Instagram celebrity known for flaunting his crime-funded luxurious lifestyle on social media. Recently, a Facebook user identified as Drixan announced on his profile that Hushpuppi is back from the prison, looking skinny. To make his narrative believable, he attached a picture of Huspuppi alighting from a jet in the company of an unidentified man. He was dressed in Gucci attire, holding bags from the same brand. Examining the comment section, DUBAWA found that this claim has received more applause than doubt from other Facebook users. For example, BriteStar Raphillrecords , admiring the picture attached to the post, also wanted the same experience. He said, See the way people dey come back from prison like people wey dey go world tour, abeg make una come carry me go that kind prison jare. Another user, Fortuner Timi Sunny , rather disgusted by Hushpuppis alleged return, said, A prison is now a place where fraudsters get awards. Im just imagining. Aside from Facebook, DUBAWA has also found similar rumours on TikTok and X (formerly Twitter). In light of the substantial Facebook engagement, where this post has received 11,000 likes and 170 shares, and considering the few scepticism expressed, DUBAWA conducted this fact-check for accuracy. Being a famous international fraudster, the arrest and eventual jail sentence of Hushpuppi, spanning from 2020 to 2022, was monitored and reported by both National and International newspapers. Hence, the news would be viral online if he were suddenly released from jail. Consequently, DUBAWA made keyword searches on Google but found no report that announced his release. Moreover, his sentence, which would last for 135 months (over 11 years), only began in November 2022. Since Hushpuppis verified Instagram account has been deactivated, we decided to conduct a reverse image search on the picture attached to the claim. Results showed that it has been on the internet since 2018. Hushpuppi started his 11-year and three-month jail sentence in 2022, and there is no credible news of a sudden release from the United States federal prison. Additionally, his old picture was used to aid the false narrative.",0
"Claim: A statement , which has gone viral on Facebook and other social media platforms, has a claim that Lai Mohammed, Nigerias minister of information, said the government increased fuel and diesel prices so as to reduce accidents and traffic on Nigerian roads. DUBAWAs checks on previous statements made by Mr Mohammed on price increase of fuel and diesel showed the minister did not make such statements attributed to him. His spokesperson also debunked Since the start of the year, many parts of Nigeria have been experiencing fuel scarcity and increase in the price of fuel across the country, leading to an increase in price recently. Oil marketers rep ortedly increased the price of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS), following approval by the Nigerian National Petroleum(NNPC) Limited for an upward review in the pump price from N165 per litre to N179 per litre. Following the increase in fuel price and diesel price, social media users have started circulating a statement attributed to the Minister of Information saying that the price was increased so as to reduce traffic and accidents on Nigerian roads. The statement being circulated reads: We raised fuel price to 200 Naira and Diesel to 800 Naira to reduce the number of traffic and accidents in NigeriaLai. DUBAWA observed that many of the social media users who commented on the post attacked the information minister for purportedly making such a comment. Because of the controversies that have trailed the statement, DUBAWA decided to check its authenticity so as to put the argument of whether the minister said it to rest. A close look at the statement attributed to the information minister shows that there was no mention of the date the minister purportedly made the statement. Several checks on previous statements made by Mohammed on the increase of fuel price led DUBAWA to a report by Vanguard published on 16th May 2016. Going through the report , DUBAWA observed that the minister did not make such a statement attributed to him. Also, an online review of credible media platforms showed that there was no such reportage. When DUBAWA contacted Segun Adeyemi, spokesperson of the information minister, he said his principal did not make such a statement. Adeyemi said, It is totally fake, please disregard it. The statement attributed to Lai Mohammed, claiming the government increased fuel and diesel prices to reduce accidents and traffic on Nigerian roads is false. DUBAWAs checks on previous statements made by Mr Mohammed on price increase of fuel and diesel showed the minister did not make such statements attributed to him. The spokesperson of the information minister also said the statement does not emanate from Mr Mohammed.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user alleged that football fans trooping to Qatar for the world cup are smuggling beer into the country by disguising Heineken as Pepsi. Verdict : The alleged image with the narrative of smuggled beer into Qatar is false. The actual scenario happened seven years ago in Saudi Arabia, where officials intercepted attempts to smuggle beer disguised as Pepsi into the country. It is chilled for moments! Great for the celebrations! Beer has been an enjoyable part of football for spectators at home and those watching live at the stadium. But the 2022 World Cup in Qatar is unlike any before it. It is the first to be held in the middle east and the first to have a hosting country lose its opening match. Interestingly, just two days before the tournaments first match in the Muslim nation, officials announced that fans wouldnt be allowed to drink beer at the countrys eight World Cup stadiums, a reversal of a previously announced policy. Just after the announcement, images of Heineken canned beer disguised as Pepsi started to make rounds on social media and were even published by some news outlets. The narrative suggested that despite the bans on beer in Qatar, some fans are still devising means to smuggle the commodity into Qatar. One Nnamdi Abana, who described himself as a Political Scientist and a graduate of Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, posted the same picture on his Facebook timeline, adding that fans will find another way to smuggle beer since they have been caught via this means. So, what did they do? They decided to shortchange the system by rebranding can beer with Pepsi. Now that theyve been caught, they may look for another option. The statement reads. Igetalk, a blog site that publishes sensational content, featured the story to insinuate that the disguised cans of beer can easily be smuggled into the stadium by the visiting tourist. the beer cans in beverage casing and wrappings will then be smuggled into the stadium in Qatar by the visiting tourists They would also be sold in the stadium, though there would most likely be a secret channel for doing this. Imagine an unsuspecting visitor buying a can of Coke, only to get a mouthful of Heineken, the statement reads. Ubuntu Jacob Navro, a Facebook user, even gave the exact number of the canned beer smuggled into Qatar by football fans; in a Facebook post he made, Jacob said over 800,000 was the number of beers intercepted in Qatar. Customs at Qatar has intercepted over 800,000 cans of Heineken branded as Pepsi this morning Who no like enjoyment , this Qatar Heineken pass Navrongo beers the post reads. The world cup is already in its first week, and against all odds and controversies, Qatar has brought the competition home. As fans around the world enjoy the competition, it is essential to verify lingering claims that have a potential impact on the competition. DUBAWA first conducted a forensics analysis to verify if this was real and not doctored. Results from Forensically, an online tool that offers image verification, reveal the acclaimed image is actual and not doctored in any way. After that, DUBAWA carried out a Google reverse image search to uncover the source of the image. Results show an image of the Heineken canned beer disguised as Pepsi that has been circulating since 2015. In 2015, The Telegraph published a news story headlined: Smugglers attempt to enter Saudi Arabia with 48,000 beer cans disguised as Pepsi. The same story was published in Morocco World News with the caption: Saudi Arabia Seizes 48,000 Cans of Heineken Beer Disguised as Pepsi Both levels featured the acclaimed picture used to paint a scenario in Qatar. In 2015, Police in Saudi Arabia confiscated over 48,000 Heineken beer smuggled into the country disguised as Pepsi-Cola cans. The scenario unfolded at the Al Batha border between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, where officials stopped a truck carrying the contraband, based on reports by several Saudi news reports . The smuggler tried to enter the goods in an innovative way, as stickers indicating that they were soft drinks Pepsi were placed on the beer cans, but that attempt failed after it was detected and thwarted by Saudi customs. The report read. The batch on the arm of the officer is also that of Saudi Arabia Customs and not that of Qatar. Even more, there is no publication in any Qatar news outlets that reported on the acclaimed narrative. The scenario happened seven years ago in Saudi Arabia, not recently in Qatar. The alleged image with the narrative of smuggled beer into Qatar is false. The actual scenario happened seven years ago in Saudi Arabia, where officials intercepted attempts to smuggle beer disguised as Pepsi into the country.",1
"Claim: Public sector wage bill size was increased to 70% of the countrys expenditure totalling $320 million under Johnson Sirleaf. False! The last employee compensation under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf was 59%, not 70% of expenditure. Data from the 2017 to 2018 budget statement and a report from USAID nullify the claim. A known supporter of the Weah-lead administration has said the erstwhile government under President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf left behind an unsustainable wage bill. According to Samuel Jackson, an Economist, the wage bill under the former administration ballooned to 70%, amounting to $320 million. He said this left the government with little or no space for capital investment, which was essential in building post-war Liberia. He made the claim during a debate with Amos Tweh, Secretary General of the immediate past administration, the Unity Party. The debate was held on a local radio station, Okay FM 99.5, and was carried live on the stations Facebook page on September 19, 2022. The claim by Mr Jackson was made at two hours and five minutes of the almost three-hour show. According to Jackson, due to this huge wage bill inherited by the CDC-led government, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) requested the Weah-led government reduce the countrys wage bill. He said this led to the government harmonization plan during the first two years of the Weah administration. This action by the government led to a series of protests by some civil servants in the country. The IMF defines the wage bill as the total compensation, in cash or kind, payable to a government employee in return for work. It includes wages and salaries, allowances, and social security contributions made on behalf of employees to social insurance schemes (IMF, 2014b). According to the IMF working paper titled: Fiscal Implications of Government Wage Bill Spending, the higher the wage bill, especially in developing countries, the greater the fiscal imbalances. With this in mind and the huge public interest this debate has generated, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claim made by Mr Jackson. During the research, DUBAWA discovered that the last approved national budget of the country under former President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, 2017/2018 puts the size of the countrys wage bill at 59% of total expenditure, amounting to $298.020,404 million. This is found on page xiii (3) of the 2017/2018 approved national budget of Liberia. Again, page two of the USAID report: Process mapping study, pay and payroll reform in the government of Liberia also confirms that the wage bill for the 2017-18 financial year was 57% of the Government of Liberias total expenditure. This is found under the caption Fiscal Conditions. Following an investigation into the claim, DUBAWA can conclude, based on official documents available, that Liberias wage bill in the final year of former President Ellen Johnson Sirleafs administration was not 70%. It was 59%, according to the budget statement of 2017-18.",0
"Claim: An online media platform Sierraloaded has alleged on Facebook that 100 ballot papers had gone missing at the FSSG polling centre. DUBAWAs fact-checker was present at the Freetown Secondary School for Girls (FSSG), Centre No: 1676 Brookfields. Contrary to claims that 100 ballot papers had gone missing, our fact checker found that the papers were rather in short supply in polling centres 7 and 8. There are a total of nine polling stations in that centre. The polling centre managers would not speak to the fact-checker. However, Ibrahim Kolleh Bangura and Sylvester Sumaila, who are party agents of the two main parties, APC & SLPP, confirmed to DUBAWA that the ballot papers were in short supply. According to them, instead of 300 ballot papers for each station, the ECSL officials supplied 200 each, meaning both stations had a shortage of 100 each. DUBAWA equally spoke to an Observer representing the Council of Churches Sierra Leone (CCSL), a credible religious institution in the country, who refused to disclose his identity. The observer said the papers were not missing; what occurred was a shortage of ballot papers. However, the ECSL officials brought the remaining 100 ballot papers each for both polling stations. VERDICT: Misleading",1
"Claim: A viral video shows Wizkid participating in the #EndBadGovernance protest. Verdict: The viral clip was retrieved from the 2020 #EndSARS protest. It is old and misleading. It is the second day of the #EndBadGovernance protest. While the first day was peaceful in some states, there were reports of violence , which has allegedly claimed the lives of 14 citizens in other states. As events unfolded, footage of Ayodeji Balogun (Wizkid) started making the rounds on Facebook, claiming that he had finally joined the #EndBadGovernance protest. The video showed the artiste speaking into a megaphone and encouraging other protesters surrounding him to speak for their rights. While some said he joined the protest in Lagos, others claimed he united with these protesters in London. The video has since been shared, as seen here , here and here . DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on YouTube and found similar videos . These lengthier ones, however, showed Wizkid holding an #EndSARS placard while addressing protesters in London on Oct 11, 2020. In the initial part of the clip, he was heard announcing the final ban on the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) by the Inspector General of Police. Afterwards, he appreciated the protesters and asked everyone to go home. He said On my way here, the IGP in Nigeria has disbanded SARS. So, Nigerian youths, dont let anyone tell you you dont have a voice. We all have a voice because Nigerians, we deserve good government. So right now I want to say thank you to everybody for coming out today. We have achieved our goal and this is just the beginning. We won. Now, lets go home.

"Claim: A Facebook user claims onions absorb bacteria and cut onions are poisonous. Verdict: Our findings show there is no proof onions can absorb bacteria or cut onions are poisonous. A Facebook post by Kunle Alade claims that onions absorb bacteria which is why they help prevent colds and flu. In the post, Mr Alade claimed this was discovered during the flu pandemic in 1919, by an unnamed doctor Onions ABSORB BACTERIA* and that is the reason why they are so good at preventing us from getting colds & flu, part of the post read. The post advised against eating an onion that has been sliced and left open for a while because they are poisonous. We looked at onion and its properties and also carried out a keyword search. Onions known as allium cepa , are bulb-shaped vegetables that grow underground. They vary in size, shape, colour, and flavour but the most common types are red, yellow, and white onions. A keyword search led to an analysis by McGill Office for Science and Society, which showed onions are not bacteria prone or bacteria magnets because they have a variety of sulphur compounds with antibacterial activity. This report also noted that sliced onions left open are not poisonous unless it was sliced on a contaminated cutting board, or handled with dirty hands. This can, however, be prevented with good food practices like washing of hands, kitchen tools and wiping down counters with sanitizer before beginning food preparation, to avoid introducing outside contamination. This practice extends to the preparation of every other food item, not just onions. The report also noted that contamination by some sort of mould is possible, because mould spores can travel through the air. Cookinglight article also disagrees with the claim that cut onion is poisonous. We found an article by the National Onion Association (NOA) which debunked several myths about onions including the claim that cut onions are poisonous. The association noted that when handled properly, cut onions are not poisonous and can be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to 7 days. A study on the antibacterial action of onion extracts against oral pathogenic bacteria showed onion extracts possess an effect on all bacterial strains. This article by verywellhealth.com noted there is no proof that onion can help prevent the flu or the common cold as claimed in this post. It also revealed that the idea of keeping raw onions in the room when sick dates back to the 1500s, according to the NOA. Our search also led to fact-checks by USA Today , snopes , Wall Street Journal , and Associated Press clarifying that leaving an onion around the house wont fight or prevent illness/flu because they dont absorb bacteria. Our findings show there is no proof onions can absorb bacteria. Placing onions around the house wont help fight the flu. It is the immune systems attack on invading viruses or bacteria entering the body that helps the body recover from sickness. It is also not true that cut onions are poisonous as they can even be stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container for up to seven days. The claims are therefore false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook page claims that Bukayo Saka has returned to training ahead of the Champions League quarterfinals. Verdict: Misleading! Available media reports suggest Saka could return to the field after the international break and surgery. However, the image shared alongside the claim has been online since 2023. On Dec. 21, 2024, Arsenals star winger Bukayo Saka sustained a hamstring injury during Arsenals 5-1 victory over Crystal Palace, which has left the England international sidelined for weeks. Sometime in February, the football ace had shared photographs of himself stepping up in rehabilitation. Amid this situation, a Facebook page, Declan and Saka Arsenal , shared a post claiming that Saka has returned to training ahead of the UEFA Champions League clash against Real Madrid. Bukayo Saka is back and training for UCL. Pray for Madrid. The Facebook handler wrote. The claim made on Friday, Mar. 21, 2025, was shared alongside the image of the 23-year-old allegedly engaged in a rigorous training session. As of Friday, March 21, 2025, the post had accumulated over 31,000 likes, 387 comments, and 47 shares. Moreover, similar claims were shared on Facebook ( here , here , here , and here ) and X here . DUBAWA noticed that users on X identified the wingers picture shared as not recent. This isnt a picture from the latest training, @haamaaan wrote. Fake, this photo, @attackerfc77 pointed out while @sxmafc warned, Dont spread fake news. Due to the virality of the claim and comments indicating that the shared picture was not recent, DUBAWA decided to verify it. DUBAWA conducted a Google keyword search to verify the information and found multiple reports predicting his return since his recovery from surgery. According to Sky Sports on Sunday, March 16, 2025, Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said in an interview that Saka has a good chance of returning to the field after his international break. This makes him available for the upcoming UEFA Champions League quarter-final matches against Real Madrid, scheduled for April 8 and April 16. On Thursday, March 20, 2025, Talk Sport reported similar developments, adding that Saka had undergone individual drills and light training sessions. However, none of the above news outlets posted the picture shared by the claimant, which suggests that England International is fully back on its feet. Furthermore, a Google Reverse Image Search of the picture shows that it is not recent, as the Facebook claimant portrayed. An X post indicates the Arsenal star shared a similar image of the player on June 25, 2023 Meanwhile, we noticed the image was also recirculated in 2024 on social media, as seen here and here . Available news reports show the claim is misleading. The image accompanying the claim has been online since 2023, before Sakas injury in 2024.",0

Cowry Wise Investment Platform is very real and genuine, it is a paying platform that gives you double your investment in not less than 45 minutes to an hour interval, reads part of the post . The post urges interested users to either call admin on the phone number provided or click on the Whatsapp link attached. Perhaps in an effort to convince other Facebook users that the platform is trustworthy, the post features a screenshot of what appears to be a payment into the users bank account. Similar posts can be found here , here , here and here . But is the investment platform legit? We checked. Some of the posts promoting the investment platform say you will be paid double of what you invest into the bank account you provide during registration. This is a red flag as fraudsters may also use those details to commit fraud in your name. A Google search for Cowrywise brought up a website with the URL cowrywise.com . According to the website, Cowrywise Financial Technology Limited (Cowrywise) is a fund manager duly licensed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Nigeria. Although Nigerians can invest in mutual funds and get returns through cowrywise.com, the company doesnt promise they could double their money in less than an hour, as promised in the Facebook posts. There is also no proof that the legitimate company or its website is in any way linked to the investment platform being promoted on Facebook. In fact, the company has distanced itself from the posts circulating on Facebook. In March 2023, Cowrywise took to its Facebook and Instagram pages to warn people against money-doubling scams. Cowrywise won't double your money in a day, we won't do it in a month either.

"Claim: Delta State Commissioner for Youth Development, Hon Agbateyiniro Weyinmi, was found in possession of a sack containing guns. Verdict: Insufficient evidence. DUBAWA did not find enough evidence to support this claim. A Facebook user, Fejiro Oliver , recently made a post alleging that the Delta State Commissioner for Youth Development, Agbateyiniro Weyinmi, was found in possession of a sack containing guns. He further stated that the guns had been handed over to officials at Ekpan Police Station, Delta State. Mr Oliver also made a follow-up post on the same issue on February 22, 2024, using the headline: Killers and Cultists as Delta State Government Appointees. This has, as of March 19, 2024, generated over 60 likes, more than 103 comments, and about five shares. This claim has prompted speculation that government officials secretly engage in criminal activities. DUBAWA conducted this verification due to the sensitive nature of the claim. DUBAWA contacted Mr Oliver to clarify his claim, but he did not respond to messages sent to him via his Facebook handle. However, we found a statement signed by Bright Edafe, a superintendent of police and the spokesperson of the police in Delta State, refuting the claim that the commissioner was caught with a sack of firearms. Mr Edafe described the claim as entirely untrue and deceptive. The police statement reads: After a careful analysis of the write-up, it is obvious that the writer is being mischievous, and the Command does not wish to go into any debate with him. However, for the avoidance of doubt and for members of the public to be informed, the command wishes to state clearly that no incident like that was recorded by the command. The write-up is not only mischievous but laughable. DUBAWA also contacted the commissioner in question, Mr Weyinmi, who debunked the claim, noting that he has already filed a petition to the Inspector General of Police (IGP) office regarding the issue. Check his Facebook account and see how notorious he is with lies and blackmailing. A petition on this to the IGP office has also been generated to help sustain this investigation to the very zenith of police investigation in this country. Be rest assured that this case will be followed to a logical conclusion and no stone will be left unturned until this case is concluded, Mr Wenyimi said. There is no substantive evidence to prove that the Delta State Commissioner for Youths, Agbateyiniro Wenyimi, was caught with guns. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame KariKari Fellowship, in partnership with Bridge Radio 98.7FM, Asaba, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim : An image shows the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu met the US president, Joe Biden. Verdict : FALSE. The presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, did not meet with US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022. The image being shared with this narrative is doctored. An image of Bola Tinubu, the presidential candidate for Nigerias governing All Progressives Congress (APC), sitting with US president Joe Biden has gone viral on Twitter and Facebook. A tweet with the image claims it was a picture of Tinubu meeting Biden on November 29, 2022. Happening now: @officialABAT on a courtesy visit to US President Joe Biden as part of his US on international engagements. Obidiots say Tinubu cannot visit the US based on his indictment. He is there right now, live with the US President. Let your Obi visit too. Mumu pipo, the tweet reads. Obidiots is an insulting name given to supporters of Peter Obi, the Labour Partys presidential candidate. Mumu pipo is pidgin for stupid people. Nigeria is set to hold general elections, including for the president, in early 2023. Tinubu and Obi are among the leading candidates for the top job. The image has also appeared on Facebook here , here , here , here , and here . Tinubus candidacy has stirred many controversies, including his alleged involvement in a drug trafficking and money laundering case in the US back in 1993, but his campaign has denied this. But did Tinubu meet Biden in the White House? In verifying the viral image, we saw some telltale signs that it had been doctored. There are significant variations in picture quality, with the part around Tinubu and the man sitting next to him looking blurry. Objects behind Tinubu have their edges rough and overlapping in an unnatural way. This is a red flag because photos of visits to the White House, the official residence of US presidents in Washington DC, are always of good quality. Professional photographers are used for all official engagements. A reverse image search led to several media reports that indicated the original photo came from July 26 2021, a meeting between Iraqi prime minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and Biden in the presidents White House oval office. The APCs presidential campaign council has debunked the claim that Tinubu met with Biden. A statement by Bayo Onanuga, the councils director of media and publicity, blamed opposition parties for the misinformation. At the time the image was supposedly snapped, he said, Tinubu was in Abuja, Nigerias capital. A viral photograph showing Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and United State President, Joe Biden, in talks at the White House is the latest in the series of misinformation being dished out by the political opposition, the statement reads. We cannot just fathom the purpose of the mischief and the falsehood which emanated from the rabid followers of Peter Obi. The apparently photo-shopped image surfaced Tuesday night, on the heels of news that Asiwaju Tinubu will embark on a foreign trip this weekend. Findings show that the presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Tinubu, did not meet with US president Joe Biden in the White House in late November 2022. The image being shared with this narrative is doctored. This report was written by Africa Check and republished by DUBAWA as part of the Nigerian Fact-checkers Coalition initiative.

"Imagine a small village in northern Nigeria where news spreads quickly through WhatsApp and community gatherings. One day, a manipulated post circulates, claiming that a local political figure plans to betray the community. Although the post is entirely false and its source unknown, it is shared hundreds of times, inciting fear, anger, and even violence. The unknown account pushing a narrative designed to exploit local tensions for foreign interests is a player in Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI). FIMI may mean different things to different people, depending on their backgrounds or the types of information they encounter. However, one thing is clear: it has become a potent tool for spreading disinformation, particularly in regions in which access to reliable information is limited. Grassroots communities, often resource-constrained and dependent on informal networks for news, are especially vulnerable to these tactics. FIMI exploits these vulnerabilities by crafting false stories that are tailored to fit local cultures, politics, and social issues. 1. Weaponizing social media and messaging apps Grassroots communities rely heavily on platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and local community apps for information. FIMI actors exploit these platforms, knowing that information spreads quickly and is often trusted without scrutiny. For example, during the 2024 #EndBadGovernance protests in northern Nigeria, protesters were waving Russian flags, to symbolize regional political interests. Russian-backed movements in nearby countries, like Niger, influenced this display. Social media played a key role in amplifying these actions, spreading disinformation about Russias involvement in local affairs. This situation highlights how FIMI actors manipulate grassroots discontent and amplify political messages through visual symbols, even if those messages dont reflect official foreign policies. 2. Using language and dialect nuances FIMI actors often target grassroots communities using local languages or dialects, making disinformation seem more authentic and relatable. For example, a fake message written in a communitys dialect about government plans to impose new taxes on farmers land might seem personal and trustworthy, especially when shared by local contacts in local languages. 3. Using local Influencers and proxies Trusted community figures such as teachers, religious leaders, or local celebritiesare often co-opted by FIMI actors to spread false information. When respected figures share disinformation, it gains credibility and spreads more widely. For instance, a respected local teacher or religious leader might unknowingly share a misleading post claiming a health risk to the community. Because of their authority, people tend to believe and pass along the message without question. 4. Targeting knowledge gaps Many grassroots communities have limited access to formal education or reliable information. FIMI actors exploit these knowledge gaps by spreading content that sounds authoritative but is ultimately false. For example, there are existing claims that traditional herbal remedies are more effective than modern medicine for treating malaria. 5. Leveraging fear and uncertainty FIMI actors often target the fear and uncertainty that pervade grassroots communities. They spread rumours about violence, disease outbreaks, or other perceived threats to create panic. For instance, in a conflict zone, FIMI actors might falsely report that a neighbouring ethnic group is planning to attack a local village, to cause widespread fear, panic, and possibly even preemptive violence in response to the fabricated threat. 6. Planting False News through Local Media Local media outlets, which may lack the resources for thorough fact-checking, are prime targets for FIMI actors. These outlets may unknowingly publish or broadcast manipulated content, which can quickly reach a large portion of the community. A local radio station might air a fake segment claiming that government aid has been diverted to foreign countries, causing widespread mistrust among citizens who rely on this aid for survival. Limited Digital Literacy: Many people in these communities lack the skills to critically assess digital content or verify its authenticity, making it easier for FIMI actors to manipulate people in such communities. Trust in Word of Mouth: In close-knit communities, personal relationships often outweigh scepticism about such information. This trust in the messenger makes it easier for false information to spread unchecked. Inadequate Fact-Checking Resources: These communities are left more vulnerable to manipulation with few local fact-checking initiatives or access to independent verification services. How to Counter the Spread of FIMI 1. Media and Information Literacy (MIL) training Educating communities on how to spot fake news is key to fighting FIMI. Simple training sessions can teach people to check sources, spot manipulation, and trust reliable platforms. Programmes like those run by DUBAWA in Nigeria help people build these skills and understand what information to trust. Local fact-checking groups, led by trusted community members, can quickly debunk misinformation. By sharing verified information, they create a ripple effect that helps keep communities informed. 3. Amplify trusted voices Using respected local figures, such as religious leaders or influencers can help spread accurate information. When these voices speak in local languages, the message is more likely to resonate and counter false narratives. Church and mosque gatherings can be effective spaces for this. Supporting local journalists with training and resources helps them report accurately and spot disinformation. Strong grassroots journalism ensures communities get reliable and timely news despite limited resources. Conclusion To effectively curb the spread of disinformation, FIMI should be a primary focus, as its influence reaches small communities by exploiting trust and cultural dynamics while limiting access to reliable information. Thwarting this issue requires collaboration at all levels to empower residents with media literacy skills, support fact-checking initiatives, and amplify trusted voices.",0
"A Facebook post circulating in Nigeria quotes Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), as saying I Will Jail Buhari When I Become President In 2023. Sowore is a Nigerian human rights activist, pro-democracy campaigner, and founder of online news agency Sahara Reporters . In the 2019 presidential elections Sowore, on the AAC ticket, went up against president Muhammadu Buhari. But he secured only 33,953 votes out of 28,614,190 total votes cast, while Buhari won with 15,191,847 votes . In August 2019 Sowore was arrested and detained for convening the #RevolutionNow protest. He was charged with treasonable felony before being released on 24 December. The Nigerian government also charged Sowore for conspiracy to commit treason and insulting Buhari in an interview. The 5 September 2022 claim , quoting Sowore saying he would jail Buhari, was also repeated in other Facebook posts . But did Sowore say this, potentially risking his own rearrest? We checked. The original post didnt give details of where or when Sowore was meant to have made the comment. This is suspicious and often a sign that a claim circulating on social media has been made up. There have been no reports in the mainstream media of Sowore making such a comment, or saying anything related to wanting to send Buhari to jail . Considering Sowores history, such a statement would have been reported by credible news organisations. We also checked Sowores verified Twitter handle and we couldnt find anything like it. Africa Check is seeing an increasing number of quotes and comments falsely attributed to key political figures as Nigerias 2023 elections approach. These false claims may distort political debate online. This fabricated quote, falsely attributed to an opposition politician, is an example of this.",0
"Kemi Busari, Editor of West African fact-checking platform DUBAWA, has been named along with ten other finalists for the 2023 Wole Soyinka Award for Investigative Reporting (WSAIR) by the board of judges at the 18th edition of the prestigious award. The news of Mr Busaris selection was contained in a press release by the Wole Soyinka Centre for Investigative Journalism (WSCIJ) on Wednesday. His story , which exposed a harmful concoction consumed by many Nigerians, led to the producers arrest and shut down of the building where its being produced, among other impacts.

"Claim: Several social media platforms claim that there was a plane crash at the Ilorin International Airport on the 22nd of July 2021. It was also tweeted by Sahara Reporter and BBC English News among others. Findings revealed that although there was a tyre burst of an airplane while it was taxiing at the Ilorin International Airport, there was no crash and no casualties. The Ilorin airport became an International airport in 2007 with both a domestic and International terminal. In order to boost the standard of the airport, the then administration of Kwara state led by Dr. Bukola Saraki, upgraded the airport to an International Standard, including the construction of a Cargo shed to create employment and improve the states gross domestic Product (GDP). But recently, aviation activities were boosted with more airlines landing and taking off, resulting in improved economic activities in the state. Air peace, the owner of the purported plane that was claimed to have crashed, began aviation business in Ilorin on the 11th of June 2021. On the day of its inauguration, the ceremony was delayed because the inaugural plane had a hitch. Consequently, when it had a tyre burst at around 10a.m. on Friday the 23rd of July 2021, various social media platforms were quick to release Headlines such as JUST IN: Plane crashes in Ilorin as passengers escaped death This was by a media platform called Solacebase.com. This no doubt caused pandemonium in Ilorin Metropolis and in many parts of the country as every newsroom scampered to make headlines of the report. Screenshots of captions from Daily post and BBC news Dubawa called the Head of Corporate Affairs of the Nigeria Airport Authority Ilorin, Adeyeoluwa Oluwakayode who clarified that there was no crash. Yes, there was no plane crash, the Air peace plane had a burst tire on landing roll while it was still on the runway of the Ilorin International Airport Mr. Oluwakayode said. He Added that, all sixty-six passengers alighted safely from the aircraft. This is just a case of unconfirmed information. Also, in a press release titled No Air Peace Aircraft involved in accident signed by Sam Adurogboye, the Public Relations Officer, Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), the rumour regarding the plane crash was debunked and a more detailed explanation was offered, highlighting the actual situation that took place. Even more, the Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), also in another Press Release, said the Bureau is not investigating the matter because it is not an unusual hitch with planes at airports. Dubawa also visited the airport and found that there was actually a hitch on the runway and the affected aircraft was positioned at a point where other planes were supposed to pitch landing. As a result, flights had to be counseled to clear the runway. However, there is no sign of a plane crash site as flight operations have resumed already at the airport. Although it is true that there was a tyre burst of an Air Peace plane B737-500, with registration number 5N-BQR at the Ilorin International Airport, it is not true that the plane crashed as reported by some media platforms. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with NTA to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: A picture shared on Twitter, which shows about nine corpses lined on the floor, suggests that they were victims of police brutality in Oyo State. False. Findings show that the picture was taken in Kaduna. Some accounts on Twitter recently shared a picture of at least nine dead bodies lined side by side, suggesting that they were killed during ongoing protests that have called for reforms in the Nigeria Police. Ogbomoso is Black. RIP to everyone we lost to the struggle, tweeted @Cheyih_Viktah on Sunday, October 11, attaching the photograph. The post was liked by 494 users of the microblogging platform and shared a total of 1,047 times as of 4 p.m. on Thursday. The reactions showed that the claim was believed by many other Twitter users. May they all Rest In Peace. This is how badly we are treated in our own country. We get nearly nothing from this system, yet, they still cut our lives short, one Nigerian user commented . Another wrote, May their souls rest in perfect peace. The Labor of our heroes past shall never be in vain. Days later, another version of the picture, a screenshot from WhatsApp, was shared by @IyanuGreat95, along with two others appearing to show protesters in Oyo State and one of the victims of police extrajudicial killing during a demonstration in Ogbomoso on October 11. Please lets us not loose focus at this point, this is not the time to be drinking alcohol and partying Lets remember the cause and pursue it till the end.. This is why we are out! Their deaths should not be in vain. An end must come to police brutality, Iyanu tweeted on Wednesday. The tweet was liked by 950 users of the website and shared over 2,100 times. A reverse image search done using Google revealed that the picture first appeared on the internet at 2:18 pm on October 11, thus predating the two tweets about Ogbomoso. It was uploaded by the Nigerian Tribune, a newspaper based in Ibadan, Oyo State, which perhaps explains why it has been re-shared in connection with protests that took place in the state. A report published by The World News an hour later also credited the picture to Tribune. Tribunes report was about an attack by bandits of two communities (Kidandan and Kadai) in Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State, which led to the death of 12 residents. The attack took place on the afternoon of Friday, October 9, two days to the tragic incident in Ogbomoso where at least one person was killed and several others injured. While three people were killed in Kidandan and four others sustained injuries, nine residents were killed by the bandits in Kadai and four were said to be in critical conditions. The nine casualties visible in the photograph are thus likely to be those killed in Kadai. The claim is false as the dead bodies shown in the photograph are victims of an attack by bandits in Kaduna State and not of protesters in Oyo. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with HumAngle to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: Cancer is not a deadly disease and can be cured using hot lemon water, coconut oil and by reducing sugar intake. All claims by this Facebook post are false because our findings show otherwise. Cancer is a large group of diseases that can start in almost any organ or tissue of the body. It happens when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably, go beyond their usual boundaries to invade adjoining parts of the body or spread to other organs (metastasizing). Cancer is sometimes referred to as a neoplasm or malignant tumour. A Facebook post by Aligwo Steve Nwosu claims cancer is not a disease but an apathy. This claim was credited to a cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University in Moscow, Gupta Prasad Reddy. The post quoted the specialist as saying cancer is not a deadly disease, but people die only because of apathy (that is a lack of interest). Cancer is not a disease, but its an apathy! Cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University, Moscow, Russia. Gupta Prasad Reddy (BV) says cancer is not a deadly disease, but people die only because of apathy, part of the post read. The post also claims cancer can be eliminated through three methods. The first method is to stop eating all kinds of sugar because, if you dont get sugar in your body, cancer cells will end naturally. The second method is drinking lemon and hot water mixture on an empty stomach before eating at 2am in the morning. The post also claims a study by Maryland College of Medicine shows that this second method is a thousand times better than chemotherapy. The third method is to take three spoons of organic coconut oil every morning and night. A keyword search on Cancer specialist at Osh State Medical University, Moscow, Russia and Gupta Prasad led to a fact-check by Africa check which warned against the false cancer cure from Dr Gupta on Facebook. We also found that the said Osh State Medical University, in Moscow, Russia, is Osh State University , a public sector University, in Kyrgyz Republic. Another search on Maryland College of Medicine led to the University of Maryland school of medicine located at Baltimore in the United States (US). This university was chartered in 1807 as the first public medical school in the US. We looked at the four claims highlighted from this Facebook post individually. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide , accounting for nearly 10 million deaths in 2020. The most common types are breast, lung, colon and rectal and prostate cancers. About one-third of deaths from cancer are due to tobacco use, high body mass index, alcohol consumption, low fruit and vegetable intake, and lack of physical activity. This shows that the claim that cancer is not a deadly disease is false. However, cancer can be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, implementing existing evidence-based prevention strategies, through early detection of cancer and management of patients who develop cancer. Treatment options include surgery, cancer medicines, chemotherapy or radiotherapy, administered alone or in combination. Low sugar intake has no correlation with cancer. No study in people has shown cutting down sugar intake prevents or treats cancer, nor has any study shown eating too much sugar causes cancer. This article by cancer.net explains that the belief that sugar is related to cancer comes from the metabolism process. So when we eat food containing carbohydrates and foods containing sugar, the body breaks it down into glucose which fuels body cells to make the energy needed to survive. Mayoclinic noted that both normal and cancer cells use glucose for energy. Also, cancer cells metabolise glucose faster than normal cells according to the Warburg Effect . The Warburg Effect is used in diagnosing cancer. In an imaging test called a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan, doctors inject radioactive glucose into the bloodstream. Since cancer cells metabolise faster, the PET scan lights up the location of cancer cells and tumours in the body. The image is used to find cancer or evaluate how well cancer treatments are working. The various ways to prevent cancer highlighted by the WHO also does not include reducing sugar intake. This makes the claim false. An article by the National Centre for Health Research noted that lemons are not a proven remedy against cancer of all types. This report by Deccan Herald also debunked the claim that hot lemon water cures cancer. Although this study highlights the importance of citrus juices and their extract in a multitargeted-pharmacological strategy, suggesting their role in the prevention of cancer as well as their possible use as co-adjuvants in modern oncological therapies, there is no study comparing the effectiveness of lemon to chemotherapy. The above study suggested further experimental and clinical studies to exploit the beneficial aspects of these juices and their extracts in full. Deccan Herald also debunked the claim that hot lemon water is a cure for cancer. A 2017 study on the Laurie acid, which is found in coconut oil, shows Laurie acid has anti-cancer properties for certain types of cancer, but additional studies are needed to further corroborate its usefulness in more comprehensive therapeutic approaches. This 2019 study shows Virgin Coconut Oil (VCO), Processed Coconut Oil (PCO) and Fractionated Coconut Oil (FCO) have anti-cancer effects and may be used for the treatment of cancer, especially liver and oral cancer. This claim is false as these promising properties found so far need more research to be standardised as a remedy or cure. We also found a fact-check by fullfact.org debunking all the cures of cancer in this claim. Our findings and studies show that this Facebook post consists of several claims that are false.",0
"Claim: A Twitter user claims NIRSAL cannot trace those who took loans from it. Sources from NIRSAL Microfinance Bank say this claim is false and did not emanate from them. Due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) introduced a N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility as a stimulus package to support households, micro, small and medium enterprises. The CBN shared the stimulus package for whosoever showed interest and by implication applied at Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) MicroFinance Bank (MFB). Recently, NIRSAL called for the payment of the loan . Following this, a Twitter user Olayemi (@olayemi_123), on Saturday, February 5, 2022, attributed a claim to NIRSAL saying that it cannot trace those they gave loans to. We cannot trace those we gave loans, the contacts they use are non-existent the statement was attributed to NIRSAL. This claim is absurd and not the kind of statement expected of a reputable organization so we decided to verify. A keyword search on NIRSAL loans led to a number of news reports and Twitter posts. In an interview with Vanguard in December, 2021, the Managing Director of the NIRSAL MFB, Abubakar Kure, said that nobody can run away with the companys money. He stated that a water-tight mechanism has been put in place to ensure full repayment of each loan. Our search also led to a Twitter post by NIRSAL Plc stating nirsal.com does not give out loans but NIRSAL MFB does. This Tweet, which was in reaction to several posts calling out NIRSAL Plc, is suggesting that NIRSAL Plc is different from NIRSAL MFB. So we looked into both names. Our findings show there are two different websites bearing the name NIRSAL. One is nirsal.com and the other nmfb.com.ng . According to nirsal.com, NIRSAL Plc is a US$500million Non-Bank Financial Institution wholly-owned by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) created to Redefine, Dimension, Measure, Re-Price and Share agribusiness-related credit risks in Nigeria. It was established in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) and Nigerian Bankers Committee in 2013. NIRSAL MFB (nirsal.com.ng), on the other hand is a leading Nigerian financial institution licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Nigeria. The Company was incorporated as a Private Limited Company in 2019 and commenced operations following the grant of a license by the CBN to operate as a National Microfinance Bank. The Bankers Committee owns 50%, NIRSAL 40% and NIPOST 10%. We also reached out to the NIRSAL MFB via phone calls and spoke to two customer representatives who noted that the viral claim is false. The information is incorrect because all our beneficiaries have a Bank Verification Number (BVN) and their BVN is what we use to know who is owing, one of the customer representatives explained. The customer representative noted that it is not possible that they wont be able to trace those they gave loans to. We have also reached out to NIRSAL Microfinance Bank via their social media pages but there is no reply to further verify this claim as at press time. There is no official link to verify the originality of the claim attributed to NIRSAL on social media. Sources from NIRSAL MicroFinance Bank also said it did not emanate from them. Hence, the claim is false.",0

"Ahn, Ahn! I had raised the dead before, Doyin, a Christ Embassy member, said flippantly, gesturing her hands towards me as though I was being ridiculous by being sceptical that a person could be resurrected. Really? My eyes widened, and smiles parted my lips as I adjusted my seat toward her. However, before I could settle in, Doyin added, Through faith, hurrying away without sharing more information. Before my encounter with Doyin, a video of Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, The General Overseer of the Christ Embassy Church, where he stated that he had resurrected 50 people, had gone viral in the country. More than 50 people raised from the dead within the last year, Pastor Oyakhilome said cockily. Maybe we bribed them in hell or heaven to come back, he added with sheer arrogance as he paced the stage during his churchs live-streamed healing programme. In the video, which went viral in late March, the cleric had nine people on a mobile bed wheeled on stage. There was no mention of their ailments, but one of the sick was fidgeting as though battling a cold. Like a magician with the stage being his oyster, Pastor Oyakhilome said a short prayer, pointing towards the people on the bed. In the name of Jesus Christ, every sickness leaves you, every demon goes away from you, every pain ceases now, and you are healed. Get up from your bed! the pastor said in a final command. Instantly, the nine people jumped up, with some rolling on the floor and others jubilating, in what appeared to be an outstanding performance. The incident, which happened during Pastor Oyakilomes church Healing Streams Festival of Miracles Season 9 on March 21, 2024, generated several online controversies. Many Nigerians expressed disbelief as they watched clips of the footage, while others said, Nothing is impossible. Following the speculations, I decided to visit the church and see how miracles were performed. At about 8:50 am on Sunday, March 24, 2024, I joined the trail of the crowd by Billingsway Road, with many heading to the Christ Embassy Church at Oregun, Ikeja. I was on time for the churchs second service, which started around 9:00 a.m. Shortly into the service, Pastor Yemisi, a beautiful dark-skinned woman, encouraged the congregation to buy and read the churchs book, Rhapsody of Realities, by Chris Oyakhilome. The 75-page book is sold for N600 and produced monthly. Following her encouragement, a lady who identified herself as Susan from Sirrea Leone shared a testimony. On Nov 21, 2021, I began to poo and urinate on my body uncontrollably, Susan started her narration, instantly commanding the congregations attention. The churchs auditorium went silent as Susans voice echoed through. Susan claimed that during the predicament, she went to the hospital, where a series of tests were conducted, but the doctors could not find the source of her ailment. She said that she eventually realised she had hyperthyroidism , which she described as having two noodles on her thyroid. However, she followed a holy spirit instruction since her condition was not getting better. The only spirit ministered to me to start preaching with the Rhapsody of Realities. After I started doing that, he told me to start preaching with a megaphone, and after a while, I became healed, Susan added, I am a result of Rhapsody of Realities. I am a testimony! According to the Mayo Clinic , hyperthyroidism happens when the thyroid gland puts too much thyroid hormone into the bloodstream. The condition is also called overactive thyroid. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) states that patients with the ailment can be treated with radioactive iodine therapy, antithyroid drugs, or thyroidectomy. A medical practitioner I consulted, Akpuka Samson, explained that hyperthyroidism can only be managed, not cured. You take tests to know what is causing it, then you take drugs to suppress the antigene, Mr Akpuka said. After Susans testimony, the church erupted with claps and a chorus ofHallelujah! Pastor Yemisi then encouraged the parish to partner with the church for the Rhapsody of Realities and become a distributor. During the service, I spoke to an usher who claimed Pastor Oyakhilome could indeed raise the dead. When I asked if she knew anyone who had been reawakened, she said she didnt. As the service continued, a series of ministers mounted the pulpit to preach. One of the ministers prayed, stretching his hands towards the congregation. A few people moved towards him, positioned their heads below his hands, and instantly fell to the ground as though told on cue. I quickly stood up to take a video. If you try it! If you try it! I will have your phone seized, a threatening voice roared behind me. The person later introduced herself as Faith, a protocol officer in the church. When I inquired why I couldnt use my phone, she responded: Using your phone during service is against the church rules. She added, It is pasted at the front of the church by the entrance to switch off your phones before entering. Five minutes later, I looked back at Faith, and her head was buried in her phone as she typed profusely. A part of me was scared, though. Maybe she was texting people to send me out of the church, I thought. After the church service, I joined some first-timers in a separate hall for new church members orientation. I met several church workers with whom I inquired about the churchs alleged healing and resurrection power. I informed them that I wanted to resurrect my dead father and that I was also battling with fibroid and needed healing. One of the churchs workers, Tochi, assured me that healing was available. Sharing his testimony, Tochi alleged that he had a pain in his leg, which intensified after he prayed on it but eventually disappeared a few days later. He said the trick is to never admit to being sick. Use words like They said I am sick instead of I am sick. Tochi said, It is a sign of faith. Another worker, James, emphasised that a healing process starts with obedience. He also asked who I wanted to resurrect, and when I responded, My dead father, he asked how long he had been dead, and I said, Five years. James then responded smirkingly, Forget it! He cannot be resurrected. How could you expect someone dead for so long and buried to be resurrected? Then, a member who said he was like a bishop and identified himself as Payne said they can only raise someone who has died within a few seconds. He gave an example: Gesturing towards the floor like an imaginary person was lying there and positioning his right arm like an earth-bender about to lift a rock, he shouted, Come back to life! He then locked eyes with me, That is how it is done. The person would resurrect after the command. When asked if the only time they could resurrect a person was if the person just died, he alleged that they could raise someone who had been killed between a day and seven days. I told Payne that I had fibroid and asked if he could heal me. He said he could and instructed me to wrap my hands around my stomach. He shut his eyes, pointed towards my tummy, and prayed with utmost seriousness. I command the demon inside this stomach to disappear in Jesus name! Payne repeated this instruction a couple of times. After the prayer session, I asked him if I was cured. If you believe you are healed, you are, Payne said, giving a facial expression like that of Bovi in the Visa on Arrival series when he wants to woo an applicant. I have given you the power through the word of Jesus Christ; receiving the healing is up to you, he added. I asked why I had to receive the healing since he was the one with the healing power and all he had to do was heal, but he insisted it was all about my belief. If I believe that I am healed, then I am. Various media reports have unveiled what healing by belief is in Africa. One such is The BBC three-part documentary on the late Nigerian televangelist TB Joshua, released on 8 January. The documentary revealed how the late Nigerian televangelist faked miracles and brainwashed sick people into believing they were healed, which ultimately led to the death of some of them. Fisayo Soyombos investigation titled PROPHETS OF THEIR POCKETS (I): At Celestial Church of Christ Headquarters, There Are Over 100 Prophet-Scammers also revealed how spiritual leaders make false predictions and perform fake healings. It was 3:05 p.m., and after spending hours in the church, I was ready to leave. However, there was a snag! A marshal told me that I could not leave while a programme was going on. He said if people were allowed to leave, those waiting at the gate would rush in, and they didnt want that just yet. I decided to use the opportunity to talk to the marshal, who had now introduced himself as Davies, about the churchs healing power. Davies told me about his personal experience with healing. But his testimony was similar to Tochis, signalling that the church perhaps trains their workers on what to tell people. Like Tochi, Davies said he had pains in his leg; he prayed on it, and the pains intensified before disappearing days later. Davies also claimed to know a lady who had breast cancer and was healed. Her right breast had been cut off, he said. The cancer has also affected her left breast, and when I registered her for our healing streams programme, she attended and was eventually healed, Davies said. He also encouraged me to read more testimonials from their healing streams for inspiration. The platform was filled with testimonials of people claiming various illnesses that were healed through the power of Pastor Oyakilohme. I participated onsite for the October Live Healing Stream with Pastor Chris. On 29th October, Pastor Chris ministered to me, and immediately, the tension in my neck and head resulting from Bells palsy ceased completely. I felt power in my hands and feet throughout the night, a testimonial attributed to one Rosemary Aboh on the website reads. When I asked Davies how I could experience such healing, he explained that the next healing programme would be in three months, in June 2024. However, there is a caveat: The healing is not instant. Davies said, First, you must increase your faith. You must also learn how to receive healing, respond to it, and retain it. This seemed familiar with Pastor TB Joshuas strategies as unmasked in the BBC documentary, where people were first brainwashed over some time to accept whatever theatrics the televangelists perform as healing. I reached out to Christ Embassy for comments on this report, but its officials declined to speak on the findings. A male voice answered the call to the official number available online for Christ Embassy but he declined to comment. I am just a pastor in one of the church branches, he said. I am not sure there is an official person that makes comments on behalf of the church to the media, but if you want to get the information, you may have to go to the headquarters for your findings. Following the pastors advice, I once again visited the Christ Embassy at Billings Way, Oregun, Ikeja, where I was referred to a church official named Patricia. I called her, but she asked me to call back after hearing my inquiry. Patricia, who identified as a deaconess, has failed to answer calls since then. Nonetheless, I spoke to a medical health professional to inquire if diseases like breast cancer can be cured by prayer or preaching. The medical doctor, Francis Agbaraolorunpo, seemed puzzled by the question. Preaching alone cannot cure any problem. Preaching may solve spiritual problems, but ailments like cancer and the like are not spiritual problems; they are biological problems. He added, Prayer can support healing because it can work as a psychotherapy, enhancing healing, but that doesnt mean you shouldnt see the doctor because you are praying. Another medical professional, O.M. Inyamg, said patients must seek medical assistance even if they pray. Yes, people can attend churches for prayers, but it must not be substituted with healing, Ms Inyamg said. Based on these findings, I contacted Christ Embassy Healing School for their comments, but none were received at the time of publication. After waiting about 30 minutes at the Christ Embassys Church, I was finally let out of the churchs door. Still, I had to squeeze through hundreds of people waiting eagerly at the passage to get into the auditorium for the days third service. They had been promised a special Sunday service.",1
"A post on Facebook claims to have the solution for haemorrhoids. It says that a mixture of bitter kola , onions and scent leaf can effectively treat them. The post also explains how to prepare and mix the ingredients and how often to take the mixture. Haemorrhoids , also known as piles, are swollen blood vessels located in or around the rectum and anus. Symptoms include bright red blood after a bowel movement, lumps around the anus and the feeling of needing to poo. Bitter kola is a tree found in the subtropical and tropical forests of Nigeria, Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African countries. Scent leaf , or African basil, has antiviral properties and may also help to boost the immune system. The same post has been republished here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) Could this be the cure for haemorrhoids? We checked. No scientific evidence, says gastroenterologist Samuel Olorunfemi said there was no medical evidence to support the claim. He is a professor of gastroenterology at Bingham University Nasarawa in north-central Nigeria, No research has been conducted on this claim. I am not aware of the recommended combination and so, there is no scientific evidence for it, he told Africa Check. Haemorrhoids can be treated with fibre-rich foods, creams, warm baths and painkillers. In more serious cases, haemorrhoids may require minimally invasive treatment or surgery. Africa Check has previously debunked other false claims about haemorrhoid remedies. This one, too, is misleading.

"Claim: The Government of the United States of America and the U.S. Embassy in Freetown will not endorse the recently announced presidential poll results that declared the incumbent president of Sierra Leone the winner of the June 24 2023, polls. Verdict : False. Neither the U.S. Embassy nor the GoUSA has issued any statement discrediting the results of June 24, 2023, presidential polls announced by the countrys electoral body Chief Commissioner. Sierra Leone a small State located in West Africa, held its sixth democratic multi-tier elections on Saturday, June 24 2023 , in which 13 political parties contested for the highest seat in the country. The incumbent President Julius Maada Wonnie Bio of the ruling Sierra Leone Peoples Party (SLPP), was declared winner of the controversial polls. The countrys National Returning Officer, Mr Mohamed Kenewui Konneh , on Tuesday, June 27, 2023, announced Dr Bio winner of the election. He defeated his closest contender for the second time, securing 56.17 per cent leaving the main opposition partys leader Dr Samuara Kamara , who secured 41.16 % of the votes. Shortly after the declaration, some presidents sent congratulatory messages to the re-elected President Bio, as evidenced here and here . On the contrary, congratulatory messages from opposition political parties in the country have not been forthcoming; even the main party in the political race, the All Peoples Congress (APC) party, has denounced President Bios re-election tagging it as a stolen victory. However, the former Interim Chairman of the APC Transitional Committee , Alfred Peter Conteh, congratulated the re-elected incumbent, President Bio. Hours after the announcement of the elections results by the Chief Commissioner of the Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL) , Jeffrey Smith @Smith_JeffreyT tweeted that the Government of the United States of America and its Embassy in Freetown had not endorsed the presidential elections results announced by the national returning officer. He added that the US reps would not attend the swearing-in ceremony of President Bio. The tweet reads in part: Appears the U.S. Government and embassy in SierraLeone wont endorse the election result as announced, which declared incumbent president Bio as the winner (with 1% over the required threshold). The Twitter user also states that the United States Representatives in the country have resolved not to attend the official swearing-in-ceremony of the president-elect Dr Maada Bio. US reps will not attend the swearing-in , the release indicated. Due to the crucial subject matter of the tweet and the pace at which the tweet has been circulated on social media, DUBAWA decided to verify the contents of the tweet. The United States Embassy in Freetowns response to @Jeffreys claim DUBAWA contacted a member of the U.S. Embassy in Freetown, Alhassan Jalloh , who vehemently dissociated the Embassy from the said statement. On WhatsApp, he told DUBAWA that the Embassy would issue a statement in due time, U.S. Embassys position concerning the outcome of June 24 2023, presidential poll The researcher also discovered the official statement issued jointly on behalf of the US, UK and EU, as seen here. From the verification, m@Smith_JefferyT does not officially represent the position of the U.S. government or the Embassy in Sierra Leone.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user alleged that popular Liberian musician Maurice Tosh Gayflor, who goes by the stage name CIC, won $1 million US dollars from Lonestar Cell MTN for winning Artist of the Year and $7000 US dollars for winning Male Artist of the year. Verdict: False! Checks by DUBAWA indicate that Liberian musician CIC did not receive $1 million for Artist of the Year, nor did he win the Male Artist of the Year category. The MTN Liberia Music Award (MLMA) was established in 2009 to celebrate artists who continue to push boundaries and showcase Liberias rich musical diversity. The 2024 MLMA edition was held on December 14th at the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Ministerial Complex in Congo Town, Monrovia, and presented awards in more than 20 categories . These categories included Producer of the Year, Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, Male Artist of the Year, New Artist of the Year, Gospel Song of the Year, Gospel Artist of the Year, and Afropop Artist of the Year, etc. Since the conclusion of the award ceremony, widespread claims have circulated on social media regarding the cash prizes and categories won at the 2024 MLMA. One such claim was made by a Facebook user, JNB , who posted on January 29, 2025, that: CIC just won $1 million United States dollars from Lonestar Cell MTN for winning Artist of the Year and $7000 United States dollars for winning Male Artist of the Year. This information has garnered significant attention, with 682 reactions, 96 comments, and three shares as of Feb. 11, 2025. Due to the widespread circulation of this claim, DUBAWA decided to investigate as part of its commitment to combating misinformation and disinformation. Verification Based on the nature of the claim, DUBAWA investigated two key aspects: DUBAWA first checked the list of all winners per category at the 2024 MLMA. This check revealed that CIC did not win the Male Artist of the Year award, as speculated. Instead, he won five other award categories: The Male Artist of the Year award was won by Jonathan Lee Pratt, popularly known as JZyNo. Also, DUBAWA reviewed the official Facebook page of Lonestar Cell MTN, the official sponsor of the 2024 MLMA, to verify the actual cash prices awarded to CIC. In a January 29 award post, Lonestar Cell MTN posted that CIC received : Conclusion Social media claims that CIC won $1 million from Lonestar Cell MTN for Artist of the Year and $7,000 for Male Artist of the Year are false. Official records from the 2024 MLMA and statements from Lonestar Cell MTN confirm that CIC did not win the Male Artist of the Year award. The cash prizes awarded were $7,000 for Artist of the Year and $3,000 for Song of the Year, along with data bundles.",1
"Claim: A TikTok video shows where stars, planets, and comets are seemingly falling into Ekiti State University (EKSU) premises. Verdict : MISLEADING. The video is an illusion used as a form of amusement. It was created with a TikTok video effect named Planets. Ahmad Ajibola , a TikTok user with the handle harjibix, recently shared a video that displayed the stars and planets rolling down from the sky. In the fifteen-second clip, accompanied by cries of distress, the user described the event as happening in an Ekiti state-based tertiary institution. Whats happening inside Ekiti State University, the caption reads. Since the video was posted on July 12, 2023, the clip has been shared and liked by 114 and 941 TikTok users, respectively. It has also generated opposing views among people. While many doubted the possibility of such an event, users still believed it to have happened. An example is @aniekpenopeter , a sceptical user who claimed that the whole world would be affected if such a thing happened. Contrarily, @ ajalaseun711 believed the narrative and asked what day it happened. Amidst the ongoing debate, a user privately contacted DUBAWA via WhatsApp for verification, prompting us to investigate the assertion. DUBAWA contacted Ekiti State University (EKSU) students, who outrightly debunked the possibility of such an occurrence in their school. According to Oluwaferanmi Omoniyi, a campus journalist and 500-level student of the Mechanical Engineering department, something of such never happened. Similarly, Bademosi Adeyemi, a 300-level student from the Soil Resources and Environmental Science department who was in school on the said date, told DUBAWA that there was no such occurrence. We also got the phone number of the claimant, Mr Ajibola, who was said to be a student of EKSU, but his number was unreachable. After that, we examined the clip and suspected some filters could have been used to manipulate the video, which turned out to be true. TikTok is a social media platform where users create and share short-form mobile videos, which often feature music in the background. Common among young people, this platform is also famous for proclaiming trends through singing and dancing. The TikTok app provides users with various filters and effects to customise and add details to videos. According to TikTok Help Centre , effects can be added before and after you record a video, but some effects are only available before recording, and others are only available after. We also observed that on Mr Ajibolas account, the hashtag CreateWithEffects and a type of video effect named Planets was used. DUBAWAs researcher clicked on the aspect with the music icon with the inscription, original sound, and a catalogue where similar TikTok effects and sound created by efya_dorothy have been used popped up. Various captions like: Kasao is coming to an end this morning, JESUS Enugu on fire, and The world is coming to an end showed this effect has been used by various TikTok users from different regions, attempting to deceive their followers. We tried out the effect to see how it works. A user must click on the part where original sound is written and follow the instruction use this sound. A user can then click and record his videos. We also realised that the Planets effect can only work outdoors and with the rear camera. From promoting misleading content to propagating fake stories, the presence of social media has been a growing concern to fighters of misinformation. Although many of the manipulated videos on TikTok appear harmless, is that a fact? In a 2022 interview with the New York Times, Henry Ajderz, an expert on manipulated and synthetic media, described the damage that manipulated videos on TikTok is causing as pervasive. He said: This kind of manipulation is only becoming more pervasive. When this content volume can be created so quickly, and at such a scale, it completely changes the landscape. Our findings revealed that this circulating video was created through a TikTok effect. It has no connection with any event in EKSU or anywhere in the world. The claim is, therefore, misleading.",1
"Claim: Viral social media posts claimed that former United States President Donald Trump made recent racist remarks against people of African descent and Arabs. Verdict: False! The speech attributed to Mr Trump has been circulating the internet for a long time. Findings also showed that some parts of the speech were cut from other write-ups claimed to have come from former South African president P. W. Botha in 1985. Election seasons in any country impact the political landscape of other countries, regardless of their degree of influence. One of the worlds major powers, the United States of America, is set to elect a new president in November 2024. Major contenders include the current president, Joe Biden, and his Republican opponent, Donald Trump. The policies the winner implements usually have a far-reaching impact globally. As such, Nigerians are showing keen interest in the build-up to the election. Expectedly, Mr Trump frequently appears among creators of misinformation. The character of the former president has been the subject of much disinformation. Some have been fact-checked here , here and here . Recently, social media users shared a speech purportedly from Mr Trump, where he allegedly berated people of Arab descent, Nigerians and other nationalities in Africa. In the speech that has been forwarded repeatedly on WhatsApp platforms, Facebook and Twitter, Mr Trump allegedly explained why he hates Arabs and Africans, noting that whites are superior. The speech further stated that Africans and Arabs are not skilled in any endeavour other than indulging in pleasurable activities that are unable to proffer solutions, unlike their white counterparts. The speech partly reads: They are good in nothing (sic) else but making noise, dancing, marrying many wives, alcoholism, witchcraft, indulging in sex, pretending in church, jealousy, fighting and complaining of bad leadership, without being able to take decisive action to remove the brigands from position (sic) of power. Let us all accept the fact that the black man is a symbol of poverty, mental inferiority, laziness and emotional incompetence. To make matters worse, he can do everything possible to defend his stupidity. Give them money for development, and they will fight and create hatred and enmity for themselves. Drill oil wells for them, and they will not have peace all the days of their life. See, for instance, whats happening in Nigeria (a country blessed with abundant resources), Southern Sudan, Malawi, DRC, just to mention a few. Look at what is currently going on in the Nigeria National Assembly. Legislators amending the constitution to favour themselves at the expense of two (200) million Nigerians. The present administration now has (sic) no economic blueprint plan, rather than noise and false propaganda. It was further alleged that the former president described Nigerias president, Bola Tinubu, as a dying man who is receiving treatment at a hospital in London, among other statements. Quotes and comments on the posts show that many people believe the speech truly came from Mr Trump. DUBAWA performed a keyword search to identify the source of the information. However, we found no information regarding the date of publication, the title of the event, or the venue where Mr Trump delivered the speech. Rather, the keyword search showed that the speech was a collection of utterances from different articles combined and attributed to Donald Trump. Further investigation revealed that the viral speech was not recent. It had been making the rounds in the Nigerian social media space as far back as 2017, as seen here , here , here , and here . DUBAWA observed that a part of the speech in which Mr Trump allegedly said White people are superior had been formerly attributed to the deceased South African President, the late P.W. Botha, in August 1985. It was said to be a reprint of the South African newspaper, Sunday Times, published on Aug 18, 1985. In the paper, Botha was quoted as saying Pretoria has been made by the White mind for the White man. We are not obliged in the least to try to prove to anybody and to the Blacks that we are superior people. We have demonstrated that to the Blacks in a thousand and one ways. The Republic of South Africa we know of today had not been created by wishful thinking. We do not pretend like other Whites that we like Blacks. The fact that Blacks look like human beings and act like human beings does not necessarily make them sensible human beings. Hedgehogs are not porcupines, and lizards are not crocodiles simply because they look alike. If God wanted us to be equal to the Blacks, he would have created us all of a uniform colour and intellect, but he created us differently The full transcript can also be found here . A close observation showed that some parts had also been edited to make it appear like they had come from Mr Trump. The word Pretoria has been replaced with the US. Mr Botha was a major player in the apartheid era in the country. He upheld white minorities and ignored the black majority. In the Rubicon address that sparked a nationwide debate and attracted international outrage, Mr Botha said he is not prepared to lead White South Africans and other minority groups on a road to abdication and suicide. He also stressed the importance of the Whites in South Africa, saying if their influence is destroyed, the country will drift into faction strife, chaos and poverty. However, in the speech, he did not describe blacks as non-humans. The quoted newspaper distanced itself from the alleged reprint, as seen here . Some keywords in the speech purported to have been made by Mr Trump also showed that it had been edited to suit a narrative, particularly about Nigeria. For instance, it included phrases describing Nigeria as a great country, blessed with natural resources which also referred to ex-president Muhammadu Buharis medical trips to London. However, these statements are not included in the other variants of the post purported to have come from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu as seen here and here . Meanwhile, Mr Netanyahu has been criticised severally for racist statements targeted at Arabs and Africans. Also, a part of the statement that describes Africans as lazy, only good at sex and thuggery, falsely attributed to Mr Trump as far back as 2015, had been debunked by Snopes . This proves that the post is a copypasta: an internet slang for a block of text copied and pasted across the Internet by individuals through online forums and social networking websites. It is not uncommon to see strings of texts posted online with the name of the purported author or speaker attached at the end of the text. DUBAWA has debunked such posts as seen here , here and here . In addition, there are instances where the subjects have come out to clear their names about such utterances. This is one of the reasons DUBAWA encourages the public to verify information sent to them before resharing it through the DUBAWA Chatbot . The viral speech attributed to Mr Trump is false. The same narrative has been attributed to several political figures in the past.",0
"In the information disorder ecosystem, a common method deployed by the purveyors of fake narratives is using political leaders to make distorted claims. Using influential figures, these purveyors exploit their audiences unsuspecting confirmation bias, causing them to accept what these prominent personalities have to say without questioning. In 2024, DUBAWA observed that Donald Trump, the president-elect of the United States of America, was recurringly being used as an object of such tactics, especially in propagating political disinformation. In this article, we highlighted some of the some of these instances. Following the just-concluded presidential polls in the U.S., a video circulated asserted that Mr Trump had announced new visa restrictions targeting Nigerian professionals seeking to enter the foreign country. Our research showed that the footage of the US president-elect purportedly declaring visa restrictions on Nigerians had been digitally altered. Besides, Mr Trump cannot make any policy until he is sworn in as executive president on Jan. 20, 2025. Read the full article here . Another claim we came across in the aftermath of the U.S. elections and also linked to President-elect Trump is that he declared a ban on the practice of same-sex marriage in the country. Studies conducted before the polls showed that a significant number of Americans supported the practice, especially after the countrys groundbreaking ruling in 2015 that gay marriage is legal nationwide. When we dug into the claim, we found it was false. Mr Trump, who had won the election, cannot make policies or bans until he is sworn in on January 20, 2025. He has no power to create new laws or abolish old ones. Also, the U.S. Supreme Courts Obergefell v. Hodges opinion, which legalised gay marriage in America, is still in force. Learn more here . Another claim widely circulated online in August 2024 was that Mr Trump lauded Peter Obi, ex-presidential candidate of the Labour Party in the 2023 Nigeria general elections. The claim added that Mr Trump also condemned Bola Tinubu, the incumbent president of Nigeria, who has been facing backlash from Nigerians over his economic policies. Our investigation, however, revealed that the video of the purported claim was fabricated. The original footage was part of Mr Trumps daily interview series to mark the first 100 days in office in April 2017. Read the full report here . Before Americans went to the polls in the highly anticipated November presidential election, which produced former Republican President Donald Trump, we found a video on X claiming that Nigerians held a parade in Lagos State to garner support for him. Research showed that the video was not new but an older pro-Trump event in Nigeria. The footage dates back to 2020, during the U.S. presidential election when supporters in Nigeria organised a parade to show their backing for Mr Trump. Read more here . Another recurring claim about Mr Trump is that he ordered the Nigerian Government to release Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). However, upon deep scrutiny, DUBAWA observed unnatural lip movements and inaudible parts in the video, suggesting the video had been digitally altered. Read more about our findings here . As the U.S. geared towards its presidential elections in November 2024, a claim went viral online asserting that Mr Trump, a then-major contender, made racist remarks against people of African descent and Arabs. This claim aimed to influence the votes of these countrys communities. Our investigation showed that the speech attributed to Mr Trump has been circulating the internet for a long time. We also found that some parts of the speech were cut from other write-ups claimed to have come from former South African president P. W. Botha in 1985. Read more here . With the policy reforms by President Tinubu in the face of the prevailing socio-economic challenges facing Nigeria, a claim online alleged Mr Trump lambasted the Tinubu-led administration for making such decisions. Upon verification, we discovered some features that raised doubts about the authenticity of the footage because it had Made with TryParrotAI.com at the bottom right corner.

"Claim: Facebook users claim that for the first time in the history of Sierra Leone, the powerful Air Force One in the United States of America landed at the Lungi International Airport in Sierra Leone under the leadership of President Bio. The Air Force One did not land in Sierra Leone because the president of the United States was not on board. Following a high level delegation of Congressmen and women of the House of Representative of the United States of America to AfricaSierra Leone, Liberia, Cote divoire and Tanzania, social media users in Sierra Leone shared claims of the arrival of the powerful Air Force One jet to Sierra Leone for the first time in the countrys history. In a two-day visit, the delegation led by the Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meek , whose ancestral lineage has been traced to Sierra Leone, spent time with the President and people of Sierra Leone. They also met with the opposition party members and visited the historic Bunce Island in Sierra Leone which was a trading port during the slave trade era. A screenshot from a Facebook user. Other notable members of the delegation were; Congress women Rep. Ilhan Omar , Rep. Joyce Beatty , Rep. Brenda Lawrence , and Congressmen Rep. Ami Bera ,Rep. Troy A. Carter . Mr. Meek was ordained Paramount Chief in what was also described as his homecoming ceremony. The delegation arrived with the huge blue and white plane with the bold United States of America inscription on it. It was therefore presumed to be the Air Force One plane and was shared on various Facebook groups. The controversy over whether the aircraft was Airforce One has been growing since then. Central to this verification process by DUBAWA is establishing what makes the jet an Air Force One and to address the misconception that has clouded the plane for a long time. The comments section on the Facebook page, as seen below, depicts the mix-up that exists on the Air Force One aircraft. To start with, the Air Force One jet is not a specific or single plane as many may believe. It is a couple of aircrafts with specific tail numbers that have the function of transporting the president of the United States. It is the symbol of the US president . What qualifies the flight to be called an Air Force One depends on whether the president is on board that flight. Over a period of time, the two Boeing VC25A aircrafts mostly referred to as the Air Force One because they have both been transporting US presidents for decades. It is therefore accurate to say that any plane with the president on board can be designated with the Air Force One call sign . Air Force One is a call sign that has a historical background. DUBAWA therefore made a false verdict on the claim of Air Force One landing in Sierra Leone on the basis that the president was not on board the plane apart from congressmen and women. Again, DUBAWA can say that the aircraft that landed at the Lungi International Airport was not of the calibre of the VC25As. Even though the plane has the same looks as the Air force Ones famous blue and white and the US badge attached by the exit door, the tail number of the flight that brought in Congressman Meek and his delegation was not like the two jets that have frequently been used by five different presidents of the United States since 1991. The plane that brought Mr. Meek and his delegation has a tail number different from the pair of Boeing 747s that have been mostly assigned the Air Force One call sign. The two Airforce One aircrafts come with tail numbers 28000 and 29000. From the screenshot, you can tell that the tail number of the plane that brought the delegation is not 28000 or 29000 that have played the role of Air Force One for three decades. Screenshot of delegation on arrival at The Lungi International Airport. The idea of a call sign adopted to serve as an air traffic controller was motivated by the need to distinguish the plane carrying the US president from other commercial flights. This was further explained in this article When President Dwight D. Eisenhower flew on a Lockheed VC-121A-LO Constellation in the early 1950s, the plane would eventually be referred to as Air Force One, being the first plane to use this call sign. This moniker was established following an incident in 1953 when Eastern Air Lines 8610 crossed paths with Air Force 8610. The latter plane was carrying the incumbent president. Military advisors taking into consideration the risk of having the president travel with a commercial flight during World War II proposed the idea of a military flight and one was immediately converted to serve that purpose for President Franklin Roosevelt and later President Truman . Prior to the Boeing 747-200Bs, there were several flights used as means of air transportation for the US presidents and these flights ranged from commercial to customized aircraft for the head of state. The US Airforce on the quest to provide a befitting and secured means of transportation for the commander-in-chief proposed the idea of having a jet specifically designed to carry presidents of the United States. From Franklin D Roosevelt who as the White House proclaimed was the first president to fly while in office to John F Kennedy who equally became the first US president to fly in a specially made presidential aircraft, these transitions were laying the foundation for what was going to be a symbol of Americas power and prestige- The Air Force One. Planes that predated the Boeing VC25As ranged from the Sacred Cow initiated during Roosevelts tenure to Independence during Trumans tenure to Eisenhowers Columbines II and III. Whilst other political leaders like the Vice President can use either of the modified Boeing 747, it becomes Air Force Two when the Vice President of the United States is on board. A project on a new Air Force One is expected to be completed by 2024 to replace the aging VC25As. The two VC25A planes have played the roles of Air Force One for three decades and are mostly assigned with the Air Force One call signs. They come with tail numbers 28000 and 290000. These two have been frequently used by successive US presidents and mostly identified as Air Force One. However, any flight having the US President on board is automatically designated as the Air Force One. In a nutshell, the Air Force One was neither in Sierra Leone nor was the pair of modified Boeing planes that have served that purpose for three decades. Again, it is important to point out that Airforce One is not one particular plane as many may believe.",1
"CLAIM: Twitter suspends Kenyas President account over Nnamdi Kanu arrest The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is false . A Twitter user CorrectBN with handle @correctbn in a tweet on July 1, 2021, claims the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu. Kanu, the self-styled leader of outlawed movement, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), which agitates for a separate state for ethnic Igbos in southeast Nigeria, has been labelled a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government. The IPOB leader, who was facing charges bordering on treasonable felony following his campaign for the secession of Republic of Biafra, had jumped bail in 2017 after a military action, code-named Operation Python Dance, targeted his family house in Abia state His arrest was announced by Nigerias justice minister and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), who said it was done in collaboration with INTERPOL. To verify this claim Dubawa began by conducting a search on the microblogging platform Twitter to find out if the account truly existed, which returned a series of parody accounts carrying Kenyas president name and picture. However, a Google search revealed a story published in March 23 2019 about the President temporarily deactivating his social media accounts due to what it termed infiltration by unauthorised individuals. Screenshot of the news on news.cn According to Twitter, when you deactivate your account, it is possible to restore your account for up to 30 days after deactivation. A further search on the handle in question @UKenyatta reveals that it was a parody account created in March 2020 almost a year after the government announced the deactivation of the President Twitter account. This simply means that the username was available and someone took advantage by making a parody out of it. Screenshot of news on the return of the Twitter account Also, in November 2020 President Kenyatta while talking about deactivating his personal Twitter account which reported by Arise tv says he would rather talk to his wife and sleep, because he always gets angered by the insults on Twitter and couldnt sleep. Screenshot of Arise news website with the story The Kenyan Presidents personal twitter account had more than three million followers before it was deactivated and his administration now uses a verified State House account @StateHouseKenya, which has over one million followers. Screenshot of Twitter handle of State of Kenya The claims that the account of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta got suspended after Biafrans reported it over the arrest of Nnamdi Kanu is untrue as online resource material shows that the Kenyan President has deactivated his Twitter since 2019 and the suspended was a fake account of the President created in March 2020.

"The Nigerian Fact-Checkers Coalition (NFC) has opened its situation rooms ahead of the Ondo governorship election. The election, scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 16, 2024, has 17 candidates vying to be the next governor of Ondo state. The NFC situation rooms will be open in Abuja and Lagos to host its members, who will monitor and fact-check misinformation and disinformation about the electoral process. The NFC has debunked dozens of false information about Nigerias 2023 general elections, including Bayelsa, Imo, Kogi, and Edo off-cycle governorship elections. It leverages effective collaboration among researchers, fact-checkers, editors, data analysts, and social media specialists to curb the menace of fake news and support election integrity in the country. The coalitions model has been adopted in other countries, including Kenya, Senegal, Liberia, and South Africa, ahead of Ghanas elections in December. Speaking on the coalitions efforts, the NFC Coordinator, Opeyemi Kehinde, said, We fully support any democratic process that respects the will of the people in the society. That is why we are working assiduously alongside our partners and relevant stakeholders to support information integrity in the Ondo 2024 gubernatorial election and to curb the menace of fake news during the poll. He also noted that they have deployed a combined team of researchers, social media analysts, and fact-checkers to monitor information trends on TV, radio, and online platforms, including social media platforms, to quickly identify and debunk claims that are spreading online and offline. He said the coalition would publish an analysis of its coverage and the pattern of disinformation it encountered after the election. Our team will also publish a comprehensive analysis of our coverage of the Edo and Ondo 2024 governorship elections immediately after the poll. The analysis is to detail misinformation patterns observed during the elections.

"Claim: Reno Omokri on Twitter asserted that civil servants in Nigeria earn N18,000 as minimum wage. Verdict: FALSE.The current minimum wage in Nigeria is N30,000, contrary to Reno Omokris N18,000 claim. Former Special Assistant to President Goodluck Jonathan, and staunch supporter of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, stated that the minimum wage in Nigeria is currently N18,000. On January 16, 2023, in an attempt to canvass votes for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, Mr Omokri, on his verified Twitter handle @renoomokri , taunted Nigeria civil servants on their choice of a Presidential Candidate in the coming 2023 General Election. He asked if they could live on the N18,000 Minimum Wage they earn. Twitter users in the comment section didnt believe his assertion and mocked him for reducing himself. One user, @Ruthlmelda8, said, Lies, while another user @COkekeOfficial wrote, shame on you! You are worth nothing. Reno has become notorious for making spurious claims, and it is strange to say the minimum wage which has been reviewed is still N18,000. This prompted us to verify this claim. A quick search showed that contrary to the N18,000 minimum wage assertion by Reno Omokri, the current minimum wage, according to the National Minimum Wage Act 2019, is N30,000. The principle behind minimum wage is to ensure workers are not paid unduly low wages and to combat poverty and inequality, including gender disparity, amongst the working population. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), which Nigeria is a signatory to, 92% of its 186 Member States have adopted the minimum wage. This shows that a large majority of countries in the world use minimum wage to protect workers. A major game changer in minimum wage agitations in Nigeria was the National Minimum Wage Act of 2004 . For the first time, workers had a real document to refer to. The Act then provided for a minimum wage of N5,500. However, this increased in 2011, following an amendment to the Act (National Minimum Wage Act 2011) which provided for N18,000 as minimum wage. Subsequently, in 2019 a new minimum wage of N30,000 monthly was approved, which is the current minimum. In May 2022, workers in Nigeria began to advocate for a new minimum w age to cushion the effect of the economic hardship in the country. This was followed by a pronouncement in January 2023 by the spokesperson of the National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSIWC), Emmanuel Njoku that the process of review of the National Minimum Wage will begin soon in line with the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, 2019. The Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, also assured workers at the 13th quadrennial delegates conference of the Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, held in Abuja that a new minimum wage will take effect come May 2024 . Furthermore, some political parties and presidential candidates have been making juicy promises of what amount they will pay workers if elected. Amid this controversy, the question will the minimum wage be increased from the current N30,000 monthly and many others linger. The International Labor O rganization, ILO, Minimum Wage Fixing Convention, 1971 (No. 131) encourage member states to create a system of minimum wages which: The claim by Reno Omokri that the current minimum wage is N18,000 is false. The current minimum wage is N30,000.

"Claim: Tope Fasua, a Facebook user, shared a video of what appears to be Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi, lamenting over his experience behind bars, after he was arraigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for online financial fraud. The video purportedly of Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, lamenting over his experience behind bars, after he was arraigned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for online financial fraud, is fake. Analysis of the video showed it was a deep fake created for a comedy YouTube channel. Ramon Olorunwa Abbas is a popular personality in Nigeria. Last year, his name took over the headlines after he was arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for charges relating to online financial fraud, what is popularly referred to as yahoo-yahoo in Nigeria. Over months that followed the arrest, Hushpuppi has triggered multiple discourses and has also been a point of controversy. Recently, a Facebook user shared a video of what appears to be Hushpuppi lamenting behind bars and sharing his experiences in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The alleged video depicted Hushpuppi chattering about the amount of money found in his apartment and also claiming to still be in possession of $250 million that is kept in his apartment untouched. He was also depicted to express his regret snapping and spending money with politicians that have now abandoned and deserted him. In the comments section of the post, one user commented, Guy man, just calm down and do your time jejely. Another commenter said, FBI don chop you. Just cool down, do your time in 20 years and you will see the green grass of home. Majority of the comments seem to resonate with Hushpuppis situation, signalling a sense of consent to the videos originality. Even more, the video has been seen by over 4,000 users, calling for verification of the claim. To verify the originality of the alleged video, DUBAWA conducted a search on Google to find any related report to the alleged video, but none was found. However, the video was traced to a comedy YouTube channel, @akposthecomedian where it was identified as having been originally shared a year ago. In the video, the facial attributes of Hushpuppi are marred by obvious adulteration. This is evident in the words uttered by the supposed Hushpuppi. The sound of his voice clearly does not conform with the movement of the lips. Also, the eyes of the supposed Hushpuppi also signalled another red flag. As his speech gets emotional, his pupils have no human presence. His eyelashes jolted inconsistently throughout the video. Our general assessment of his facial features shows that the supposed Hushpuppi was a deepfake. This is also evident in the lips of the supposed Hushpuppi, exhibiting different colours as he lamented. These findings led DUBAWA to conduct an analysis of the alleged video on Deepware (an online tool that identifies deep fakes). The results showed that it was a deep fake; in fact, both versions of the video from Facebook, and the original source were both found to be deepfakes. The alleged video has been in existence on social media since 2020 and was only reshared by a Facebook user to revive the narrative. The video is also doctored as revealed by Deepware and was deliberately created by a Youtuber to generate clicks from viewers. Hence, this claim is fake.",1
"Claim: The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, stated that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias GDP. Verdict: True On Thursday, November 10, 2022, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate Bola Tinubu claimed that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He made this assertion while speaking at a town hall meeting with the mining and agro-processing stakeholders in Lafia, Nasarawa State. During the meeting, the presidential candidate lamented that Nigeria was well-endowed, given its industrious, energetic population and vast inventory of land, water, and other natural resources. He said that the solid minerals sector contributed less than one per cent to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be derived as the value of all goods and services available for final use and export. During election campaigns, politicians are fond of quoting figures to swing public sentiment in their favour, and it is incumbent that politicians be held accountable for what they say. Hence, we decided to check the veracity of the statement. Having thought of the imperative of verifying the veracity of this claim, we sought to identify the volume of the solid minerals in Nigeria, at least in 2021. First, we sought evidence from the 2021 mineral production report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) which revealed that the grand total of solid minerals production at the end of 2021 was 89,482,541.07, suggesting an increase of 39.19% from 2020 outputs which stood at 64.29 million tons. The report, released in July 2022, also added that Limestone, Granite, and Laterite were the three biggest minerals mined in 2021. What does this translate to in monetary value? How much contribution does the total output add to Nigerias Gross Domestic Product? To answer these questions, we proceeded to find more evidence. According to the NEITI audit released in 2020 (the 2021 audit report is being awaited), Nigerias total GDP in 2020 was 152.32 trillion, with the solid minerals sector contributing N686.64 billion, representing 0.45%. In 2021, according to World Bank data and Trading Economics analysis , Nigerias Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased to 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion , a value which represents only 0.05 per cent of the world economy. Yet, despite this increase, the Central Bank of Nigerias Economic Report for the third quarter of 2021 affirmed that the solid minerals sector contributed the least to Nigerias GDP growth with a mere 0.01 US Dollar = 4.4 Nigerian Naira (NGN). And what does the CBN figure translate to in terms of percentage contribution to national GDP? Dataphyte analysis of the NBS report shows that the mining and quarrying sectors total contribution to the GDP increased from 368.9 billion in 2019 to 1.101 trillion in 2021. This means the sectors contribution to the countrys GDP increased from 0.26% in 2019 to 0.45% in 2020. In 2021, the sector, having increased in productivity to 89,482,541.07 million tons, still contributed 0.63% to the total GDP of 440.78 billion US dollars, amounting to approximately N173.5 trillion . In March 2022, the executive secretary/CEO of NEITI, Dr Ogbonnaya Orji, also confirmed that Nigerias solid mineral sector was contributing less than one per cent to the nations GDP , having risen from 0.18% in 2018 to 0.29% in 2019. Based on information from multiple sources, Bola Tinubus claim that solid minerals contribute less than one per cent to Nigerias GDP is true.",1
"Claim: Shehu Sani, a Nigerian politician, tweeted that some students were kidnapped in Ondo State. Available evidence on Sanis claim is false and misleading. No school children were kidnapped in the hijacked bus in Ondo. Shehu Sani, a former senator from Kaduna state in Nigeria, tweeted on Thursday that some students were kidnapped in Ondo State. The report of the abduction of schoolchildren in Ondo is another tragic news. The kidnapping of students has become a pandemic. Recently, there have been incessant cases of kidnaps across the country, including those of school pupils fueling agitation across the country. Expectedly, Sanis tweet gained momentum quickly on the micro-blogging social network, Twitter, with some of his followers spreading the information at a rapid rate. The tweet, which has the tendency of reaching the 1.9 million people who follow the senator, started gaining engagement barely one hour after it was posted. It already has 164 retweets and 742 likes as of 9:22 p.m. on Thursday. Some of the comments under the posts were in affirmation of the senators tweet. One of those who tweeted was Emmanuel Nweze (@EmmanuelNweze10) who wrote, @ShehuSani, Kidnapping of children in Nigeria has become a very big business of Fulani terrorists in the land so is no more a news beaus Government of Nigeria is Supporting them by paying them money Another commentator under the post, Chegwe Ezenwa (@ChegweEzenwa), wrote, @ShehuSani, This is the kind of pain that parents are being subjected to on a daily. How could people be so inhumane as to make families feel such pains and apprehension? Its a cold world Earth globe americas. On Sunday, May 30 2021, over 100 students of Islamiyya School at Tegina in Rafi Local Government Area, Niger State were abducted . Also, on March 13, 2021, Thirty-nine students of the College of Forestry Mechanisation in Kaduna were similarly held hostage by bandits, according to an earlier report by The Punch. On 20 April, 2021, at least 20 students and two staff members were kidnapped in Greenfield University, Kasarami, Chikun LGA, Kaduna State. Between April 23 and 26, five of the students were killed. Earlier on Friday, February 26 2021, more than 300 schoolgirls were kidnapped by unidentified gunmen from their boarding school in Jangebe, Zamfara State. On February, 17,2021, at least 42 people, including 27 students, were kidnapped in Kagara, Niger state, a report by The Nation Newspaper stated. In 2014, 276 schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok by Islamist militants Boko Haram brought global attention to the scourge of raids on schools in Nigeria but the most recent attacks are suspected to be the work of criminal gangs. According to several news reports, a staff member of a Chiomola private school, Omolayo Ojo, was abducted by some gunmen in Ondo State on Thursday morning. The staff member of the school, which is located at Oba Ile Estate, Akure North LGA of Ondo State, was whisked away after gunmen hijacked a bus belonging to the school. The incident occurred in the morning around 7am, while the driver and the abducted staff were moving around town to pick up pupils of Chiomola school. Several reports including the one by Punch reported that only a staff member of Chiomola private school, Omolayo Ojo, was abducted by the gunmen. Speaking to journalists, as replicated by Sahara reporters, Ojo said the gunmen threatened to harm her if she did not cooperate with them. She added that she was taken to an unknown destination but later found her way back to Akure after asking for directions from people she met on her way. In an interview, the Principal of the school, Mrs Bolatito Akindemowo, confirmed that no pupil was abducted during the incident, adding that security operatives had been briefed of the incident. This has never happened to our school before. However, the staff that was kidnapped has been released but we are yet to find the school bus. We have reported the incident to the police, the principal stated. To further verify this claim by Senator Shehu Sani, Dubawa correspondent reached out to the Ondo State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr Tee-Leo Ikoro, in a phone interview. He stated that there was no abduction in the state. He added that there was only a case of vehicle snatching. There was no case of abduction. It was just a case of vehicle snatching by some of our hoodlums. They didnt even abduct the lady. It was not a case of abduction not to talk of going away with school children. People are just spreading false information all over the place. Immediately the incident happened there was panic in the atmosphere and you know that once there is panic, people will begin to say all sorts of things they are not sure of, he added. Based on the evidence available and credible news reports, Senator Sanis tweet is false and misleading.

"Claim: Nigeria spent N3.63 trillion on debt servicing between January and December 2022. Verdict: Missing context. While Nigeria paid off N3.63 trillion debt in 2022, the countrys total public debt stock has risen to N46.25 trillion ($103.11 billion), according to data from the Debt Management Office (DMO). A few weeks to the end of his second-term presidential bid, President Muhammadu Buhari and his communications team have spoken highly of the administrations achievements. Recall that in December 2022, during a meeting with the Secretary General of the Abu Dhabi Forum, Sheikh Al-Mahfoudh Bin Bayyah, and his deputy, Pastor Bob Roberts of the United States, Mr Buhari said he had tried his best to solve Nigerias challenges as president. In a statement by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to the President (Media & Publicity), Mr Buhari said, We will continue to solve our problems, especially as they relate to the youth. We are big in size and population, facing many challenges, but in many areas, we are trying. In seven-and-a-half years, I have done my best. He also reiterated the claim in January 2023 when he noted that he had served Nigeria to the best of his ability, emphatically stating that he had not disappointed anyone. There have also been documented cases of cabinet members speaking highly of the administration to play down criticisms of his achievements by opposition members, as can be seen here and here . During the presidential election campaign, the president-elect, Bola Tinubu, promised to build on the current administrations legacy. Supporters of Mr Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) on social media are also not left behind. They have continually taken to their pages to extol Mr Buharis achievements. One of them is a Twitter user Imran Wakili Oluwafemi @IU_Wakilli who has consistently praised the president in his tweets, here , here , and here . On April 10 2023, the user tweeted that Nigeria paid off N3.63 trillion debt between January and December 2022, wondering why such news about Mr Buhari would not trend. As of the time of writing this report, the tweet had been viewed more than 298,000 times. Some Nigerians have questioned the claims authenticity, urging DUBAWA to conduct a fact-check. Nigerians and other economic experts have expressed concern over the countrys rising debt profile under Mr Buharis administration. The outgoing president has been severely criticised for his administrations penchant for loans, particularly external ones. An analysis by Premium Times shows that external debt under Mr Buhari has grown three times more than the combined figure recorded by the past three administrations. While the Obasanjo government met $28 billion as foreign debt in 1999, it left $2.11 billion in 2007 after successfully securing a write-off by the London and Paris clubs of foreign creditors. The Yaradua/Jonathan government added $1.39 billion to what they met. The Jonathan government also incurred an additional $3.8 billion, taking the countrys total foreign debt to $7.3 billion when that administration ended in 2015. Nigerias external loan reached $28.57 billion by December 2020, meaning an extra $21.27 billion had been accumulated under the Buhari administration three times the combined amount by past governments since 1999. While the Nigerian government consistently explained the loans were to help facilitate the execution of some projects, critics opined that the loans could compromise the countrys sovereignty. According to a report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), external debt burdens expose developing countries like Nigeria to higher risk profiles of debt contracts, for example, shorter maturities and more volatile financing costs as to sudden reversals of private capital inflows. It also noted that external debt burdens deemed sustainable by international creditors could quickly become unsustainable for developing nations in cases of unforeseen contingencies. Meanwhile, a report by Cogent Economical and Finance noted that public debts (both domestic and external) could have positive impacts on the economy of the debtor nation. The authors argued that domestic debt significantly impacted long-term growth while its short-term effect was negative. On the other hand, external debt constituted an impediment to long-term growth, while its short-term effect was growth-enhancing. Conclusively, the study suggested that the government should direct the borrowed funds to the diversification of the productive base of the economy. Data from the Debt Management Office (DMO) showed that Nigeria spent $2.4 billion on servicing external debt from January to December 2022. The Central Bank of Nigerias exchange rate of US$1 to NGN448.08 was used to convert the $2.4 to N1.07 trillion. The country paid off $618.6 million on servicing multilateral debts from the International Monetary Fund, African Development Bank, International Fund for Agricultural Development, African Development Fund, Africa Growing Together Fund, International Development Association, European Development Fund, Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa and the Islamic Development Bank. On Bilateral debts, the country spent $336.5 million and $1.45 billion for Commercial debts within the same period. On Domestic Debt servicing, FG repaid N668.6 billion from January to March 2022, N664.7 billion from April to June, N820.5 billion from July to September and N406.7 billion from October to December 2022. The FG spent N2.56 trillion on domestic debt servicing from January to December 2022. However, the total public debt stock of both the Federal and state government(s) stood at N46.25 trillion ($103.11 billion) at the end of December 2022, according to data from the DMO. While the Domestic Debt Stock was N27.55 trillion, the external debt stock was N18.70 trillion. This significantly increased from N39.56 trillion ($95.77 billion) in December 2021. The breakdown showed that the Federal Government s share of the Domestic Debt Stock was N22.2 trillion, while that of the 36 states and Federal Capital Territory stood at N5.3 trillion. The data shows that the country indeed paid off N3.63 trillion in domestic and external debt stock as of December 2022. Still, available records showed the country incurred another extra debt of N6.69 trillion between January to December of the same year, going by the difference between the total debt stock at the end of 2021 and 2022. In a press release issued on March 30, 2023, the DMO explained that the debt stock had increased due to new borrowings by the Federal and state governments to fund budget deficits and execute projects. Although the Nigerian government spent N3.63 trillion on debt servicing from January to December 2022, data from the DMO showed that the country acquired an extra N6.69 trillion in debt within the same period. The Twitter user who made a claim had not given sufficient information.",1
"Dapo Olorunyomi, the Publisher of Premium Times, has criticised Metas decision to discontinue its third-party fact-checking programme in favour of a community-driven model, among other content moderation strategy modifications to be implemented. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., Facebook and Instagrams parent company, announced the recent development on Monday, Jan. 7, 2025, stating that it was the companys response to growing criticism of political bias against conservative parties in fact-checking processes conducted by media organisations in the United States. In reaction, Olorunyomi said that fact-checking organisations in third-world countries would bear the brunt, as many rely heavily on partnerships with social media platforms like Meta for their revenue. A lot of third-world fact-checking organisations dependbetween 80% and 100%, in some caseson their revenue from this third-party partnership, he said. The media mogul noted that Metas abrupt decision raises concerns about the future of fact-checking and accountability in the media sector and tech companies. He frowned at Metas decision to only reveal it to the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), the governing body that spearheaded the project only 30 minutes before it was made public. Olorunyomi noted that Elon Musks influence on the US media landscape worsens the battle to uphold truth and democracy, suggesting that his radical approach has contributed to a problematic relationship between technology and democratic values. Its not as if its lesser outside than in the U.S. Its as bad in the US as it is in countries like Brazil and the Philippines, where tech communities and central governments are pushing back, he said. It also speaks to how it affects the revenue structure of media houses, the strong arm of tech communities, and the danger that technology can pose to democracy. Its not always true that things will get better with new technology, he said. Those who think that, once technology lands, the solution has arrived, can now see that how we manage technology with human agency matters more. Olorunyomi warned that this could increase misinformation, as users may not have the expertise necessary to assess claims made online accurately. He stressed the importance of recalibrating algorithms to mitigate the spread of falsehoods rather than relying solely on user-generated content for context. He, however, anticipates pushback from various stakeholders concerned with the potential consequences for political participation and public discourse that the announcement can bring. He revealed that efforts are ongoing within the IFCN to handle the situation. Also, he called for innovative responses to adapt to this new development, advocating for synergy between technology and human agency to uphold democratic values.",1
"Claim : Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) resumes activities on 3rd October, 2023. Verdict : Contrary to the circulating information, FUOYE management has confirmed that it is not resuming academic activities on 3rd, of October. The calendar making the rounds on WhatsApp was fabricated. On the 9th of September, 2023, the Federal University Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) witnessed a sad event as the body of Atanda Modupe, a 200-level nursing student of the institution who had been previously declared missing , was found in a shallow grave within the school premises. Following this, the management announced an indefinite closure of the school, instructing all students to return home. Recently, a new revised calendar began to circulate on WhatsApp with news that FUOYE will resume academic activities on the 3rd of October, 2023. It also had a breakdown of other activities, including lecture duration, matriculation, examination, and date for another semester. Due to the circumstances that led to the schools closure and the argument among other students who doubted this information, DUBAWA decided to step in with this fact-check. Firstly, DUBAWA contacted Dotun Ajayi, FUOYE Students Union President, who said the viral calendar was fabricated and never emanated from the school. He added that he does not know whether the school will resume on October 3rd, as speculated. The school recently held a senate meeting regarding resumption, but no official memo has been released regarding the resumption date, he said in a telephone conversation. We also reached out to Wole Balogun, Special Adviser on Media Matters to the FUOYE Vice Chancellor and he debunked the information. He said that the students fabricated the news about resumption. He further provided an official circular released by the management to debunk the narrative. As the Special Adviser on Media to the Vice Chancellor, I can tell you that the management has debunked that information. It is our students that are carrying it around. I can send you the latest official memo, he told DUBAWA over a telephone call. FUOYE management has officially debunked the rumour that its academic activities resume on 3rd October. The claim is false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed President Bola Tinubu blocked a deportation flight from the United States from landing in Nigeria. Verdict: The claim is false. While some countries have resisted accepting deportation flights, no credible news report or evidence confirms President Bola Tinubu blocked any such flights from landing due to impromptu scheduling. Following former U.S. President Donald Trumps executive order to deport undocumented immigrants, the first wave of deportations primarily targeted individuals with prior removal orders or criminal records. In early 2017, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) began conducting large-scale raids, leading to the deportation of hundreds of migrants, particularly from Latin America. Countries like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras saw a surge in returnees, prompting diplomatic tensions as some leaders pushed back against what they saw as abrupt and aggressive enforcement measures. A similar pattern has emerged under Trumps 2025 administration, with mass deportations resuming amid heightened immigration crackdowns. Colombia , for instance, experienced a mass deportation that led to a diplomatic dispute between the U.S. and Colombia when President Gustavo Petro initially rejected deportation flights. However, Petro later reversed his decision after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on Colombian goods and threatened further sanctions. Drawing a parallel to this case, a Facebook account @Express shared a post claiming President Bola Tinubu has blocked a US deportation flight from landing. Tinubu blocks U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria over lack of timely notice Take them back, he declares. U.S. deportation plane stuck in the air for 23 hours, waiting for landing licence as Tinubu refuses approval, vows to deny entry, the post reads. The post, shared on Jan. 28, 2025, had 19 likes, four comments, and six shares as of Feb. 22, 2025. Similar claims have been shared here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . Although this claim was not widely viral, it emerged amid a trend of similar misinformation following Trumps executive order on undocumented immigrants. Given the sensitivity of deportation issues, DUBAWA checked. Using specific keywords from the claim, DUBAWA searched for possible reports or claims that affirmed what the Facebook account shared but found none. Instead, the search led to more links where the claim was similarly made. See here , here , and here . No credible news sources or official government statements supported the allegation that President Bola Tinubu blocked a U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria. Unlike the Colombian case, which received extensive international media coverage, no reputable outlets reported a similar incident involving Nigeria when the claim was made. Given the diplomatic significance of such an action, it would have been widely covered if true. However, subsequent reports confirmed that 85 Nigerians deported from the US arrived in Lagos on Feb. 17, 2025. These individuals were among the 3,690 Nigerians identified for deportation amid President Trumps 2025 crackdown on undocumented migrants. The Nigerian government has since expressed concerns about the process, rooting for a more structured approach. Despite these deportations, no evidence remains that President Tinubu blocked U.S. deportation flights. The claim that President Bola Tinubu blocked a U.S. deportation flight from landing in Nigeria is false. No evidence supports this allegation, and no credible news reports confirm the event.",0
"Ireti Kingibe, the senator from the Labour Party representing the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), marked her first year in office on June 12, 2024. A few weeks later, she celebrated the occasion by listing legislative motions, bills, and constituency projects she had sponsored within one year in office on her verified X account ( archived ). Her claim included facilitating road construction at Kpaduma, Karu, and Gwagwalada. She also listed streetlights at Karamajiji, Mpape, Kwali, and Jikwoyi, an ongoing 50-bed hospital at Dobi, and a Consultant Office Block construction at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, as part of her achievements. Based on DUBAWAs count, she made claims about 29 projects in total. For most, she did not mention locations, but DUBAWA tracked nine identifiable projects to investigate the lawmakers claims as part of our accountability responsibility. Out of the nine projects, DUBAWA found three projects to be true. We started with the 50-bed hospital at Dobi, Gwagwalada, which the senator mentioned as ongoing. On a visit in early August, this reporter met an uncompleted project at the site, a walking distance from the existing health care centre in the community. For her second verified project, we went to Ishan Road in Karu and confirmed existing reports of 6km of asphalt road construction. We then proceeded to the Karamajiji community, where she claimed to have facilitated the installation of 22 streetlights, the third project we validated in her claim. DUBAWA saw the first instalment, numbered 12, at the communitys entrance while other streetlights stood a few feet away from each other. She mentioned 23 streetlights in Anagie, Sangaruwa, Ajegunle, Gbagi village, and Mashapa. DUBAWA found only four in Gbagi village, while other places mentioned suffer from the lack. No resident confirmed such a project in all the communities mentioned. Anthony Udeh, a motorcyclist who works around Jikwoyi on the outskirts of Abuja, sneered when this reporter told him that the lawmaker claimed she facilitated the construction of a 1.5 km road in Phase 1. As he rode to the location mentioned in the claim, he narrated how he had an accident on the road about a year ago and was hospitalised for three months. After we arrived at the road, he explained that the streets at the other phases of Jikwoyi had been tarred more than two years ago, but Phase 1 was only graded in anticipation of the construction of erosion control. For more than a year, I havent seen a road construction machine on this street, let alone construction, except if grading now means construction, he said in pidgin. The road at Jikwoyi Phase 1 has been eroded. Nothing on the road suggests construction work had been done in the past year when DUBAWA visited in August 2024. In contrast, DUBAWA noticed that the road bears a signpost at the entrance: Erosion construction works at God of Elijah road, Jikwoyi FCT Abuja Senatorial District. DUBAWA confirmed that the other roads she mentioned are tarred already, apart from the road at Jikwoyi Phase 1. However, her predecessor, Philip Aduda from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), facilitated them in the 2023 Appropriation Bill, which was signed into law on Jan. 3, 2023. We obtained data from Tracka , a grassroots platform for tracking community projects, to validate our findings. In the 2023 Federal government constituency and consolidated capital projects for the FCT, N90 million was budgeted for the Jikwoyi Phase 1 road with project code ERGP202301237 during Adudas era. The agency in charge, Upper Niger River Basin Development Authority (RBDA), disbursed N7,616,744.18 on Aug. 14, 2023, to commence the road construction and asphalt design, as seen on GovSpend , a civic tech platform collating data on federal government expenditures. Though Kingibe was already the senator then, Aduda budgeted the project. A similar issue happened with the roads and drainage at Kpaduma 1 and 3, which she claimed to have facilitated. N100 million was budgeted for the construction in 2023 with project code ZIP20231339, and it has been ongoing since Dec. 29, 2022, when N45,469,767.45 was released. DUBAWA went to the location and found the roads done halfway. The partial construction doesnt look recent. Also, the signpost at the entrance to both roads attributed the project to Mr Aduda. Although we found no record of funds disbursed for Pai in Kwali on GovSpend, we discovered that N100 million had been budgeted for the road and drainage construction in 2023 with project code ERGP202301236 on Tracka. At the time, Mr Aduda was the senator, and it was described as ongoing. After journeying to the location, we confirmed this, where the construction was done halfway. Ms Kingibe claimed that the new Consultant Office Block was being constructed at the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada, but did not state that it was ongoing. However, available records revealed that Mr Aduda facilitated the project. As seen on Tracka, the project code is ERGP202301233, and the budget is N100 million. On Dec. 3, 2023, GovSpend revealed that N72,159,994.5 was released for the project, catering for the projects tax, study design and construction. Six months later, N18,893,874.92 was disbursed for the continuation. The total amount expended so far equals N91,053,869.42. As stated earlier, the ongoing project invalidated the senators achievement claim. The senator also claimed to have facilitated the completion of Angwan Dodo Road, and DUBAWA verified its completion. But before she became the senator, N150 million was explicitly budgeted for its completion with the project code ERGP202301239 on Tracka. Data obtained on GovSpend revealed that payment for the project had commenced on Dec. 12, 2020, when N27,065,861.61 was released to construct 1.3km of the road. To cover the expense for a 1.3 km distance on three different occasions in 2021, the Federal Government released N38,649,234.10 on March 25, N31,544,509.22 on Oct. 4, and N25,642,497.15 on Dec. 17. Another 1.3 km was covered with N29,935,452.07 on Feb. 29, 2022. By Aug. 14, 2023, the Federal Government had commenced disbursing funds for the design of the projects completion, which cost N8,030,697.69. More than N127 million were cumulatively released to complete the road on March 20, 2024, which were proceeds from the ERGP202301239 project code. Constituency projects in Nigeria are government-funded initiatives that provide public goods and services to specific electoral districts to improve the constituents quality of life. Since the return to democratic rule in 1999, billions of Naira have been allocated to these projects to ensure that citizens benefit directly from government spending. The projects primary goal is to extend governance benefits to local communities by addressing various needs, including infrastructure development, healthcare, education, and agricultural support, which lawmakers annually nominate for the appropriate government agency to execute. Although reports indicate that over N2 trillion has been allocated to constituency projects from 2003 to date, covering more than 18,000 projects across Nigeria, many of these projects remain unexecuted or poorly implemented , leading to significant waste of public funds. All past presidents in Nigeria, except Umaru YarAdua, have criticised the initiative, including its progenitor, Olusegun Obasanjo . However, Lukman Raji, a lawyer and the director of legal services at the Elites Network for Sustainable Development (ENetSuD), disclosed that the projectalso called the Zonal Intervention Project (ZIP) is not lawmakers initiative but a collaborative arrangement between the executive and legislature. He said, They are arrangements made for conveniences sake, to ensure that the dividends of governance reach every constituency. Although the concept of constituency projects is not explicitly written in the constitution, Mr Raji noted that how lawmakers present itas though they are personal achievementscan be misleading. The legislature presents it to people as if they did it, sometimes to spite, which is not the case. The intent is to channel development to a particular constituency, not for lawmakers to claim personal credit. This is why, over time, the idea of a constituency project has come to be seen as a political tool rather than a development initiative, he added. Ijeoma Okereke, a project manager at UDEME Africathe social accountability project of the CJIDprovided further insights into Nigerias zonal intervention projects execution. She clarified that even after a lawmakers tenure ends, projects they facilitated in the budget may proceed if the funds have already been released. If a lawmakers tenure ends, the projects may still be executed because the funds may have already been released for those projects by the budget and finance ministry to the responsible departments or agencies, she explained. She revealed that a succeeding lawmaker oversees previously nominated projects while introducing their own only if the lawmaker felt they were necessary. The five communities Ms Kingibe mentioned at Mpape have deplorable roads that would have been easier for bike riders to navigate, especially at night, if the streetlights truly existed. Eunice Adelabu, a POS operator at Ajegunle, said she stopped staying late on the street after getting robbed in April since she commenced work the previous month. Bike riders stopped coming down the road at night because of the poor road, and I understand them. If the streets were illuminated, they would easily avoid potholes that discourage them. I wouldnt have become a victim of the incident since a bike would have conveyed me off the street on the day, she said. Yakubu Aliu, a farmer at Ledi, said the ongoing hospital at Dobi would be helpful in their healthcare needs if completed quickly. If it can be adequately staffed, [the new hospital] would reduce the pressure on the existing Dobi health centre, especially from other communities that can access it here before going to the Gwagwalada teaching hospital. Despite his initial reaction, Mr Udeh hopes to witness Jikwoyi Phase 1s road construction someday to ease his movement on the route. Multiple phone calls and WhatsApp messages to Ms Kingibe went unanswered. We also messaged her on Twitter and email but received no response when this report was filed. When we presented our requests to her media aide, Kennedy Nwankwo, he promised to revert after contacting the project director on Oct. 2, 2024. We received no feedback when we filed this report. In a phone call with DUBAWA, Mr Aduda said the claimed projects were part of the earlier budget cycle, which he and his colleagues in the National Assembly approved. The 2023 budget had already been passed when the new administration resumed in June. As a principal officer at the time, I can confirm that the budget was operational before her tenure began, he said.",1
"Claim: X user claims that the inflation rate in Argentina has completely dropped. Verdict: Misleading! While Argentinas inflation has declined, it remains significantly high, at 209 per cent annually and 3.5 per cent monthly. These rates are higher than Nigerias 32.7 per cent annual and 2.52 per cent monthly. Economies around the world have been experiencing varying degrees of inflation. Nigerias annual inflation rate recently rose from 32.15 per cent in August 2024 to 32.7 per cent. Following this increase, an X user, Oji Ugo, expressed dissatisfaction with Nigerias volatile inflation. To compare Nigerias situation to Argentina, which has also faced fluctuating inflation, she claimed that Argentinas inflation had completely gone down while Nigerias now stood at 32.7 per cent. She wrote, BREAKING NEWS: Nigerias inflation rate has increased to 32.7%, while Argentinas inflation has gone down completely. On yoo mandate we sha stand. While this post received low engagement, with 34 reposts and 42 likes, it appeared to be generating more claims. For instance, @BarrTailorson, a user who retweeted the post, said Nigerias inflation rate is more than 50% and that Ms Ugos claim is false. Apart from X, this claim has also been reposted on Facebook . DUBAWA conducted this verification to set the records straight. Nigeria VS Argentinas inflation rate As of September 2024, Nigerias annual inflation rate stands at 32.7 per cent , reflecting an increase from 32.15 per cent in August 2024. This marks a rise after two consecutive months of decline in the inflation rate. In the same September, Nigerias monthly inflation rate was pegged at 2.52 per cent . This represents an increase from 2.22 per cent recorded in August 2024, indicating a rise in the average price level compared to the previous month. Increased transportation and food prices drove this rise due to recent petrol price hikes. As of September 2024, Argentinas annual inflation rate was 209 per cent , down from 236.7 per cent in August. However, its monthly inflation rate was reported at 3.5 per cent. According to a poll by Reuters , the 3.5 per cent recorded in September is the lowest monthly rate since 2021. Argentinas inflation has not decreased completely. However, notable improvements have recently occurred. Despite these improvements, Argentinas inflation rates are significantly higher than Nigerias in monthly and annual terms.",0
"Nigerias first loan from the Paris Club a $13.1 million fund was taken from the Italian government in 1964 for the building of the Niger dam. The nations borrowing from foreign lenders continued but was deemed generally insignificant until the oil boom of 1971-1981 which brought about big borrowing. When oil prices crashed in 1982, Nigeria was unable to pay off the loans it borrowed. With the spike in interest payments and penalties, the debt became a financial crisis. This continued through the military regimes till the return to civilian rule in 1999 when President Olusegun Obasanjo embarked on the debt relief campaign. Nigerias debt, as of December 2004 stood at $36 billion which equals N 4.82 trillion using the official exchange rate of N134 to US$1.00 at the time. On June 29, 2005, the debt relief efforts yielded results when the Paris Club and Nigeria agreed on a US$18 billion debt relief package . Recently, a viral image showing Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), had the claim that Mr Abubakar who was Vice President at the time, led the Economic Management Team (EMT) that paid off Nigerias debt. This campaign effort to show off Mr Abubakars achievement has sparked several debates for and against the claim. An Economic Management Team (EMT) is a team of experts that manage the resources, finance, income and expenditure of a country and advise the President on economic policy matters. Currently, Nigerias EMT is being chaired by the Vice President with the Minister of Finance, Minister of Budget and National Planning, Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Minister of Agriculture, Minister of Information and Culture, Governor of the Central Bank, Special Adviser to the President on Economic Matters, Director-General of the Budget Office, Director-General of the Debt Management Office, and Director-General of the National Bureau of Statistics as members. Was this the same situation during the period Mr Abubakar was Vice President? The Economic Management Team which appears as the Economic Management Council is listed as a Federal Executive body by the Nigerian constitution. This council is chaired by the Vice-President. In an article by Punch, Mr Abubakar said he assembled the economic team and in another article by the Guardian , he said he was the leader of the economic team. While the constitution recognises Mr Abubakar as the chair of the economic council, research shows that Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala who is currently the Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), led the EMT that cleared Nigerias Paris Club debt. According to her biography on the WTOs website, Mrs Okonjo-Iweala who served as Minister of Finance twice (from 2003-2006 and 2011-2015), spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club Creditors. As Minister of Finance in Nigeria, she spearheaded negotiations with the Paris Club of Creditors that led to the wiping out of $30 billion of Nigerias debt, including the outright cancellation of $18 billion, part of the biography reads. This report also noted Mrs Okonjo-Iweala led the economic team of President Olusegun Obasanjo. According to the Debt Management Office (DMO) document on Nigerias debt relief deal with the Paris Club, the relief was achieved through the collective efforts of the President, the Ministry of Finance, the National Assembly, the DMO, the EMT, and other stakeholders. To say the Vice President was the chairman or head of the Economic Team/Council is correct but to say he led the conversation that led to the debt removal could be misleading.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user asserts that the former governor Godswill Akpabio has stepped down for his opponent Emmanuel Enoidem. Verdict: FALSE. Our findings and Mr Akpabios campaign council disclaimer show the claim is false. A Facebook user claims the senatorial candidate of the All Progressive Party (APC) in Ikot Ekpene District, Godswill Akpabio, has stepped down for the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Emmnuel Enoidem. This post was met with mixed reactions from both parties involved. While some congratulated the PDP candidate, others asked them to discredit the information. The Directorate of Media and Publicity for the campaign council of Akapbio shared a disclaimer when DUBAWA reached out to them. The statement indicates their candidate is still in the race and would not step down for anyone. They added that massive turnout for their candidates during the campaigns motivated them to continue the race and advised their supporters to ignore the insidious message. Our findings and a disclaimer by Mr Akpabios campaign council reveal the claim is false.",1
"Claim: The President of the Liberia Council of Churches (LCC) and senior pastor of the historic Providence Baptist Church, Rev. Dr. Samuel B. Reeves Jr., said, Liberia is the oldest African nation and least in poverty and education. Verdict: False! Reports from the World Bank, Mappr, Mikscholar.com, Bscholarly and other credible institutions prove that Liberia is not rated the poorest or the least in African education standards. The president of the Liberia Council of Churches and the senior pastor of the Providence Baptist Church, Reverend Dr. Samuel B. Reeves, Jr. , stated that Liberia has the least educational system in Africa and is the poorest country on the continent. The Providence Baptist Church , the Cornerstone of the Nation, is the oldest church in Liberia. It is also where the countrys Declaration of Independence was signed and the place used by the Liberian legislature for its first assembly. Delivering his Sunday sermon on September 17, 2023, to the church at central Monrovia, pastor Reeves asserted, How can we be the oldest nation, and we are the least in everything, the least in poverty and education? The sermon was carried live on the churchs official Facebook and YouTube pages, Providence Baptist Church Liberia, with some engagement expressed through shares, comments, and emojis. The Baptist preacher made the claim at 1:23:48 1:24:00 hours/minutes/seconds of his sermon under the theme, The Leaders Ability to Lead Up, with text taken from Nehemiah 2:1-8. In an effort to provide some electoral guidance to his congregation, the Baptist prelate highlighted some adverse developments in the country and emphasised why his congregation should vote for suitable candidates. However, he refrained from naming any candidates. DUBAWA looked into the preachers claims by assessing the keyword least used by the preacher. According to the Cambridge dictionary , least is less than anything or anyone else; the smallest amount or number. The Merriam-Webster dictionary also defines least as lowest in importance or position. To begin with, DUBAWA contacted the claimant via telephone for the source of his statement, but Dr. Reeves could not provide the source or evidence for his claim except to tell DUBAWA that he stands by his sermon. To ascertain whether Liberia is the poorest in Africa, we found that although Liberia is one of the 10 least developed countries, it is not the poorestdata from the World Population Review on poverty ranking in Africa for 2023. Of 26 countries ranked by the World Bank as having low-income economies , 22 are in Africa. These rankings refer to the very poorest countries in the world . Africa also includes 23 of the worlds 54 lower-middle-income countries . Of the poorest 10 in Africa , Liberia is ranked seventh, with Burundi and Somalia occupying the last and second-to-last positions with $771 and $875 GDP, respectively. In addition, a 2022 World Bank Report also listed South Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, and Sudan as the lowest scoring poorest countries. Finally, DUBAWA found a 2022 Mappr report showing that Burundi sits at number one in poverty in Africa, and Liberia is in eighth place. The Global Finance Group also ranks Liberia at number 10 of the poorest countries in Africa, with a GDP of $1,788. They record that the poorest countries are South Sudan and Burundi, with GDP figures of $516 and $891, respectively. DUBAWA also verified if Liberia has the least education system in Africa, as claimed by Dr. Reeves. According to the United Nations, an education index is a component of the Human Development Index published every year by the United Nations Development Programme. Alongside the economic indicators and life expectancy index, it helps measure educational attainment. Again, according to the World Population website, the 2023 education rankings have Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali occupying the last three. Liberia is not one of the last ten countries. It was discovered that according to a December 22, 2021, report by Mikscholars.com, Liberia is not among the top 10 countries with the worst education system in Africa. DUBAWA also discovered in the September 19, 2023, Bscholarly report on the top eight countries with the worst education systems in Africa that Liberia was not on the list. Based on the evidence available, the claim that Liberia is the poorest and least educationally developed country in Africa is false.",1
"Claim: A campus news Facebook page, Campus Catch NG, has a claim that the Federal Government said it would attend to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) after the National All Progressive Congress convention. False. No media platform reported the supposed statement from the Federal Government. The report was only shared by a few pages on Facebook with no primary source of information. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) recently extended its initial one-month warning strike, adding two months. The Union and the Federal Government have been in the news since the commencement of the strike. Since the extension, ASUU and the federal government have been trending on social media platforms. As such, different claims and inferences have been made on the issue. Recently, Campus Catch NG posted on Facebook that the Federal Government of Nigeria says it will attend ASUU after the APC National Convention. Enejor O. Samuel, a follower of the page, expressed his dissatisfaction with the supposed news. Na lie This is very untrue namake una no finish this party na, he said. Similarly, a private group that shares ASUU news shared a similar claim on its group. Ab Laky, a member of the group tagged the news as fake. Over a thousand reactions have met the post shared by Campus Catch NG, with more than 60 shares, hence, DUBAWA chose to fact-check this claim. DUBAWA first carried out a keyword search on the latest news reports on ASUU strike. Another version of the claim was found on Nairaland . The version links the story back to the Campus Catch NGs Facebook page. Apparently, no media house has reported the supposed statement made by the Federal Government. The latest report on ASUU found on Google doesnt include the supposed statement made by the Federal Government. We found the National Association of University Students threats to the Federal Government and ASUU in a bid to get them to call off the strike. We could only find pages sharing the supposed statement from the Federal Government. No media house has reported the supposed statement. Where and when the statement was made is nonexistent. Hence, the claim is false.",0
"CLAIM : The Queen of the United Kingdom, Her Royal Majesty, Elizabeth II wrote a condolence letter to the Nigerian government over the death of President Muhamadu Buhari. The claim that the Queen wrote a condolence letter is FALSE THREE pictures- claiming evidence of Muhammadu Buharis death and that the Queen of Britain, Her Royal Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, wrote a condolence letter to the Nigerian government over the demise of the president have recently been making rounds on social media and WhatsApp. An attached post to the pictures claimed that the royal majesty wrote the letter on February 7th, 2017, furthering that former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa May, also paid a condolence visit to the Nigerian Ambassador to the UK to register her grief towards the death of the president. The text inscribed in one of the pictures reads thus: The Queen of Britain, Her Royal Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has sent a message of condolence to the family of Nigerias President Muhammadu Buhari and the people of Nigeria. There are no official reports on the speculated death of the President and the message of condolence from the two sources close to the presidency and to Nigeria have said President Buhari has passed on and that the photos circulating online are those from his previous visit. Another London source says Prime Minister Theresa May has visited the Nigerian Ambassador to the UK. In a message of condolence, the Queenhas said the following about Buhari: The death of President Buhari came to us as a shock. He has been one of the active pillars in Africa. May the good people of Nigeria and Africa know that our hearts are with them in these hard times. In mid-2016, President Muhammadu Buhari left Nigeria in a highly controversial trip to the United kingdom to treat a persistent ear infection not less than a year after he won the 2015 presidential election. The trip which was to take 10 days was to enable the President to meet with an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist after he was examined by his personal physician and an ENT specialist in Abuja. The medical leave was, however, extended following concerns his health might get worse. An official statement advanced the leave was extended to enable the president to wait for the results of a series of tests that were carried out on him. Mr. Buhari ended up using seven weeks which fuelled anxiety among Nigerians who were spreading speculations about his health. Upon his return to the country, the president told newsmen he had never felt so sick as he felt during his stay in London for treatment. The ICIR ran a check on one of the pictures which the poster claimed was the Queens condolence message, using Google reverse image tool to ascertain the time the image first appeared online. The search which showed seven results in 0.42 seconds revealed that the earliest use of the image found by The ICIR was on November 18, 2018, in a post titled Buharis cousin Mallam Daura attacks Nnamdi Kanu for insisting Jubril is Buhari on one 9jaflaver.com The blog claimed to have culled the excerpt of the interview from The Sun Newspaper, but The ICIR could not find the interview on the newspapers website. The picture resurfaced on popular microblogging site, Twitter, on 26 November 2019, in a tweet by one Akanimo Umah @AKANIMOUmoh5. The image which was then reposted by another user on the microblogging site @navimumbaiipob on October 2, 2020, at exactly 12:08 post meridiem, has gathered 414 retweets and 242 likes as of October 20, 2020. The post attached images purported to be of President Buharis death certificate and accused Her Royal Majesty of covering up the claim and conspiracy against the actualisation of the Republic of Biafra , a secessionist state that existed from May 1967 to January 1970 during Nigeria civil war. At the height of the anxiety about the presidents health in 2017, there were speculations of the presidents rumoured death flying across the country. Popular among the speculations was the one pushed by Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). By comparing Buharis pre- and post-medical leave physique, Nnamdi Kanu advanced that Buhari had died and had been replaced by a lookalike who he called Jubril from Sudan. Since making the claim, several social media users have been reposting that president Buhari is an impostor with varying pictures to question his identity. Although Nnamdi Kanu did not provide evidence to back the claim, he later denied making such an accusation. However, the president while responding to the claim in a town hall in Poland where he attended a United Nations climate conference, regarded those peddling the false information as ignorant and irreligious people. Discussions about the conspiracy rested from online arguments prior to the 2019 elections. But due to the protracted silence of the President over the Lagos Lekki shooting of the armless #EndSARS protesters, Nigerian netizens brought back the argument while many people fell for it. The ICIR again, conducted a search for media evidence of the Queens correspondence with Nigeria between 2017 to 2020. The earliest correspondence found by The ICIR was the letter written by the Queen to felicitate with Nigeria on the occasion of her sixtieth independence anniversary. The letter which was conveyed to the presidency by the British High Commission in the country called for a stronger bond between Nigeria and the United Kingdom. It gives me great pleasure to offer my warmest congratulations on the 60th anniversary of Nigerias Independence, together with my best wishes for your countrys continued happiness and prosperity, the message read. The United Kingdom and Nigeria benefit from strong and enduring ties as Commonwealth partners through shared history and most importantly, our people. These are bonds that I hope and believe will flourish long into the future. she wrote Also, the featured image attached to the claim was used when Her Majesty signed the European Withdrawal Act which gave royal assent to the United Kingdoms exit from the European Union on June 27, 2018. Our investigation also showed that the picture which was copyrighted to Wikimedia (Chatham House) has been used multiple times to illustrate events involving the monarch. The ICIR also subjected the featured image to a metadata tool and it revealed that the picture was taken on 18th November 2014 at exactly 6:17 pm with NIKON D800 (camera) and by Ian Enness, a freelance photographer. Based on the above findings, the claim that Queen Elizabeth II wrote a condolence letter is baseless and FALSE, just as the returning of the claim that failure of Buhari to address the #EndSARS protests on time does not constitute a sufficient condition to mislead citizens on the same issue that had been resolved since 2018. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with The ICIR to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: An X user shared a video claiming some Muslims in the North prayed against President Bola Tinubu and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Verdict: Misleading! Statements from Islamic scholars and related findings revealed that the Islam worshippers did not pray against Mr Tinubu, and the recitation of Surat Al-Qunut in the video was not a prayer against an enemy. Many Nigerians have faulted the Tinubu-led administrations economic policies and decision to remove fuel subsidies . This development led to the recent nationwide protest against hunger and hardship, as many Nigerians condemned rising inflation and food prices in the country. The protest was hijacked by hoodlums in some states in the northern part of Nigeria, which resulted in the looting of public and private properties. The nationwide protest, tagged #EndBadGovernace, commenced on Aug. 1 and ended on Aug. 10. While the protest lasted, several misinformation circulated online as people tried to push various narratives. One of the claims that circulated was a video shared by an X user, Peter Obi Grassroots Mobilization . The handle had shared a video with the caption Al-Qunut Prayer against President Tinubu and the APC ongoing in North. In the video, some Islam worshippers prayed and mentioned Mr Tinubus name. As of this reports filing, over 32,000 users had watched the video, 500 users reposted it, and nearly 1,000 users liked it. The video has been generating mixed reactions from many users. A user, Akanni @kujembola_mike , who believed the video, taunted Muslims for protesting against Mr Tinubus government even though both the president and the vice-president are Muslims. He wrote: Muslims against Muslim-Muslim government, hunger and hardship nah your mate? Peter Obi kept repeating that no religion buys food cheaper, but they claimed they would teach him lessons. Who is learning the lessons now? I laugh in Ijesha. Another user, Tayo Blessedhands ( @tayoowode ), commented that this was similar to how Nigerians once prayed for Buharis demise. Na so pipu pray for Buhari to kpai, but the man spent eight years as President. This one too no go work, he quipped. Mohammed Ibrahim @AlgoniIbrahim, for his part, said the Surat Al-qunut recited in the video was not against the president and should not be politicised. Please lets make the record Street (straight). This Alqonot was not against the PBAT. It is for the nation and For Gods Guidance of the entire spectrum of our leadership at all levels. Please stop politicising our religious engagements. Due to the sensitivity of the footage, DUBAWA scrutinised it to ascertain its veracity. To verify the claim, DUBAWA carried out a keyframe analysis of the video, which showed that a user had shared the clip on TikTok on Aug. 5, 2024. DUBAWA also scrutinised the videos caption, which reads, Ya Allah, Kakawo Mana Sauki Akasarmu, Ya Allah, which in English means Oh Lord, give us a comfortable time. To establish what the worshippers said in the video circulating online, DUBAWA contacted some Islamic scholars for more clarification. Dr Mahmud Danjuma of the Department of Islamic Studies, University of Ilorin, Kwara State, told DUBAWA worshippers in the video were praying for Mr Tinubu and his advisers amid the countrys challenges. The Islamic scholar quoted the worshippers as saying: Bola Ahmed Tinubu is in your hand, his advisers are in your hand. God, help us over our enemies; help us over bad governance. God, we take cover in you from hunger and thirst. God, we take cover in you from famine. Mr Danjuma added that contrary to the viral claim, the worshippers recited Surat Al-qunut, a supplication offered during prayer at a specific point while standing. There was no part of the video where they prayed against the president. Rather they prayed for him and recited Surat Al-qunut, which is normal during prayers. Corroborating Mr Danjuma, Dr Mohammed Sanni of the Department of Arabic Studies, Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, Zaria, Kaduna State, told DUBAWA that the Surat Al-qunut is a popular Surat that Muslims recite during prayers. I have watched the video again and again. What they are saying in Arabic is a prayer for the president and his advisers. Reciting Surat Al-qunut is a normal thing we do when we pray; its a prayer for comfort. DUBAWA discovered that Surat Al-qunut (sometimes referred to as dua-e-qunoot or qunut dua) is a special supplication mentioned in the hadith. It is often recited and known for its association with the Witr salah. Al-Hasan ibn Ali (the grandson of Muhammad) said he was taught by the Prophet to say the qunoot dua as follows (translated into English Language): O Allah, guide me among those You have guided, pardon me among those You have pardoned, befriend me among those You have befriended, bless me in what You have granted, and save me from the evil that You decreed. Indeed You decree, and none can pass decree, and none can pass decree upon You. Indeed, he is not humiliated whom You have befriended. Blessed are You our Lord and Exalted. The viral claim that Muslims prayed against Mr Tinubu and the ruling APC is misleading. Findings showed they were instead making supplications to God to help the country and the Mr Tinubu-led government.",0
"A post published on Facebook in Nigeria claims that Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the secessionist Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), remains in custody because he refused to do the governments bidding. The post attributes this claim to Nyesom Wike , the vocal and influential governor of the southern Rivers state. The Nigerian government has since 2021 detained Kanu on a series of charges, including terrorism . This is despite him being acquitted by a court ruling in October 2022 . According to the claim, should Wike expose the secret that keeps Kanu incarcerated, the government would be forced to free him. The post alleges that Wike further stated that Nnamdi Kanu is still in their custody because he has refused to dance to their tune and because Buhari has asked him to do something and he has refused to do it, so they are not releasing him. Nigerians choose a new president on 25 February 2023 to succeed Muhamadu Buhari, who has been in office since 2015. Ipob has been demanding the secession of southeastern Nigeria to form an independent country called Biafra . There are concerns that violence due to this might lead to election delays . The same claim appeared on Facebook here and here . But did Wike make these remarks as the post reports? The post gives no details of when or where Wike is meant to have made this statement. A link to a blog is provided but this only repeats what is in the post. Such a lack of detail is often a red flag that a quote circulating on social media has been fabricated. Given the governors national profile, such claims would also have been widely reported by trustworthy media sources. We could find no such reporting. We also asked Kevin Ebiri, Wikes special assistant on media, about the quote. The claim is absolutely fake news, he told us.

"Claim: A Facebook user, Yekeh Kolubah, alleged that members in the neighbourhood of the New Georgia United Methodist Church were plotting to burn the church over a gay wedding held in the church. Verdict: False! Some members of the New Georgia United Methodist Church were resisting the removal of the pastor for being anti-gay. On Sunday, Oct. 13, 2024, a story went viral on social media (Facebook) that the New Georgia United Methodist Church was conducting a gay wedding. Several blogs and Facebook users, including Yekeh Kolubah and Stress-Free Blog, took to their official pages to claim that the church was conducting a wedding between two men. Facebook user Yekeh Kolubah wrote, Wedding at Methodist Church between two men. The neighbourhood is bringing gas to light the church and Pastor in New Georgia. Some of the comments under this post are seen in the screenshot below. This post generated over 90 comments, over 40 emojis, and six shares. Stress-Free Blog also took to its page, saying, I just got hold of the photos from the Gay wedding that was going on in New Georgia at the Methodist Church. News reached us that they came from the States to get married in Liberia here because their Mom is a Liberian. This post, too, had over 50 emojis, 20 comments, and 19 shares. DUBAWA had to verify the claim due to its virality and the controversy it generated within the context of the local culture and tradition. To investigate this, DUBAWA had to find out two things; To begin with, we contacted the claimants via WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger to prove their respective claims, but they did not respond, as seen in the screenshots below. The researcher then investigated the claim to ascertain the facts and discovered that normal church activities came to a standstill when some New Georgia United Methodist Church members tried to prevent the removal of their pastor, Rev. Leo T. Mayson. According to a live Facebook feed of journalist Nyantee Samuel Togba from the grounds of the church compound, there was never a gay marriage conducted. Rather, some church members were resisting the removal of the churchs pastor by the head Bishop of the United Methodist Church of Liberia, Bishop Samuel Quire Jr. According to Journalist Togba, Rev. Leo T. Maysons removal is attributed to his alleged critical stand against same-sex marriage being discussed within the circle of the United Methodist Church worldwide. Following this incident, the head of the United Methodist Church in Liberia, Bishop Samuel Quire, confirmed to journalists at an elaborate press conference that he had suspended two pastors, Rev. Leo T. Mayson of the New Georgia United Methodist Church and the head Pastor of the 72nd United Methodist Church. Bishop Quire said that the United Methodist Church in Liberia is not a gay church and will never adopt any such identity. He added that members of the United Methodist Church of Liberia firmly uphold the sacredness of marriage as a union between one man and one woman. Bishop Quire said, It was a rumour that I, the Bishop, was going to the New Georgia United Methodist Church to perform a gay wedding between two men, and they got this information on Saturday, and they started sharing it within the community with the intent that the people can come to prevent it. Bishop Quire furthered, All of the pastors of the United Methodist Church are under the appointment of the Bishop, and I had suspended six local church pastors because they complained, but they all have refused to honour their suspension letters. The Bishop of the United Methodist Church in Liberia revealed that he was going to the New Georgia United Methodist Church to induct a new pastor. However, when he heard that there was a protest, he did not go again. Also, the researcher then investigated the photo posted by Stress Free-Blog using a Google reverse image search to authenticate whether or not the photo was indeed taken in Liberia, and it was discovered that the photo was first used on Instagram by one Leo Ayala . The picture was posted on July 15, 2024 , by an Instagram user, Leo Ayala, when his older brother and best friends, James and Jayson, got married. The wedding was held on July 13, 2024, in Gig Harbor, Washington. Based on the accounts from the incident and the clarity provided by the Bishop of the United Methodist Church in Liberia, Bishop Samuel Quire, the claim made by Facebook user Yekeh Kolubah and the Stress-Free Blog is False..",1
"Death hoaxes, although now common due to social media, are not a new phenomenon. A death hoax is a deliberate report of a persons demise, which is later discovered to be false. While these are done by random people for different reasons, in some cases, the said victim might intentionally spread the claim. An example of this is the recent rumour of the death of Nigerian hip-hop star Oladipupo Oladimeji, who had the stage name Oladips. It was discovered to be false, and a suspected Public Relations (PR) stunt after Mr Oladimeji said he was alive and would soon provide answers to the rumours. He is not the first Nigerian celebrity to pull such a stunt. Here is a list of others who have done this in the past. Also, below are seven public figures who were victims of death hoaxes that we verified in 2023. Lateef Adedemeji is an award-winning actor and seasoned movie producer from Abeokuta, Ogun State. He was nicknamed the crying machine because of his brilliant performance in crying scenes or roles. In May 2023, a Facebook user sharing videos with the tag Rest In Peace claimed he is dead. However, after verification, we found it to be false. Hollywood actor Jean-Claude Damme, a martial artist, actor, filmmaker, and fight choreographer, was rumoured to be dead in June 2023. Mr Damme became famous after his role in the movie Cyborg in 1989. A Facebook user claimed that the actor passed after a stroke in his home, but this was not true, as we discovered the original image used to depict Mr Dammes demise was doctored . We also found that the same photo had been doctored a few times with pictures of other celebrities hoaxed to be dead. Canadian singer Justin Bieber , a best-selling artist whose pop songs sparked a global craze in 2009, was rumoured to be dead in June 2023. According to the claimant, Mr Bieber, who was recently diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome , died after a ghastly car accident. Our findings showed that this is not just false but a recurring hoax. We also discovered that the image used to portray the singers accident was from an accident in Florida in March 2022, not June 2023, when the rumour was circulating. Nigerian politician Enyinnaya Abaribe, a lawmaker representing Abia South Senatorial district, is rumoured to have been shot dead by gunmen in his residence in Aug. 2023. We found one of the images used to depict this incident was taken from a 2021 incident in Anambra where gunmen attacked the motorcade of a House of Representative member representing Nnewi North, Nnewi South/Ekwusigo Constituency, Chris Azubogu. Two other images were from a 2022 attack on the convoy of Ifeanyi Ubah, a Senator representing Anambra South Senatorial Zone. In Aug. 2023, controversial journalist Kemi Olunloyo alleged that Oscar-winning American actor Jamie Foxx was dead. Mr Foxx was earlier in April 2023 hospitalised in Atlanta following what his family described as a medical complication. However, our findings and a video shared by the actor on Instagram discredited Ms Olunloyos claim. Former American boxer Mike Tyson, who competed between 1985 and 2005, was said to be dead in August 2023. The boxer who was nicknamed Iron Mike and Kid Dynamite in his early career and later on The Baddest Man on the Planet reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion from 1987 to 1990. A Facebook group, Honduras Radio , shared the news of the boxers death without stating the cause of his death. However, we di scovered it to be false as there were recent videos of the fighter on a podcast. In Oct. 2023, social media was awash with news of the death of Nigerias former military Head of State, Yakubu Gowon. Mr Gowon served as Nigerias Head of State from 1966 to 1975. Our findings, however, revealed that the death of the former Chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors, Gowon Edoumiekumor, who died on Oct. 7, 2023, was mistaken for that of the former military leader because of the name Gowon.",1
"Claim: An X (formerly Twitter) user claimed that Okra can be used to eliminate quick ejaculation in men. Verdict: Insufficient evidence! No research was found to support that okra can cure quick ejaculation in men. On the contrary, experts say okra can lead to male infertility. Okra, also known as the ladies finger (Abelmoschus esculentus), is a flowering plant in the mallow family native to East Africa. It bears edible green seed pods and is also used in traditional soups in some parts of Africa. Okra is enjoyed as a vegetable soup in various dishes. Due to its mucilaginous properties, it is also used to thicken soups, stews, and sauces. The Yorubas call it Ila, the Igbos call it Igbo, Olewele, while the Hausas call it Kubewa. However, on Feb 28, 2024, an X user, Prince Fynn, claimed that okra can be used to eliminate quick ejaculation. He listed the vegetable as part of his thread : Best ingredients that eliminate quick ejaculation and simple ingredients to cure low sprm count. He posted : You can also try using okra to eliminate quick ejaculation. All you have to do is Get three pieces of okra, slice them, get the dry seed of okra, and ferment everything with soda water for two days. After that, take half a cup daily for one week. As of March 10, 2024, the thread has over one million impressions. The post on Okra has 67,300 views, 58 retweets, 142 likes, and 131 bookmarks. X users who commented on the post were seeking more information on how okra can be used to eliminate quick ejaculation. Given the virality of the post and its significance to public health, DUBAWA decided to fact-check if okra truly cures quick ejaculation. We used keywords on Google search and found that a blog in 2022 published that Okra is the most popular food for treating premature ejaculation in people who eat a normal diet. The blog claims that okra contains vitamins K, A, and zinc that can improve mens sexual health. The blog advised men to Soak 3-4 coarsely sliced okra in water overnight. For a month, sip on the filtered water first thing in the morning. In both cases, they are successful. A similar article was also published byKindly Health blogand on Nairaland However, some publications claim that okra can cause infertility in men due to the presence of Gossypol in the vegetable, which inhibits sperm production and motility. These claims can be found here . In 2017, Dr Ochuko Erikainure, a Senior Research Officer at the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, Lagos State, warned that Okra could lead to infertility in men of reproductive age despite its nutritional value. He said, Okra seeds are very rich in toxic pigment called Gossypol, which promotes infertility in men by arresting sperm production (spermatogenesis) even at lower doses. Gossypols are oil soluble and natural polyphenols secreted by plants as a defence against predators. A study , titled Antifertility Effect of Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) in Men, published in the Asian Journal of Research in Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences in 2018, concluded that okra can lead to male infertility due to its ability to reduce sperm production. The studys conclusion reads: The presence of gossypol in okra seed played a significant role in the pathogenesis of the diseases. The antifertility effect of okra was ascertained in mice, and it was confirmed that methanolic extract of okra fruit affects testes, testicular tissues, and semen parameters (motility, count, and morphology). These detrimental effects alter the semen integrity and may subsequently halt fertilisation. The study recommended that The consumption of okra as food (vegetable) and medicinal plant by healthy fertile humans should be properly assessed. Likewise, infertile men under medication should stop the consumption of okra, especially raw. The findings of this study are in tandem with studies published in the International Journal of Advanced Biological and Biomedical Research in 2014 and another one published in the European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research in 2015. The two studies concluded that consistent consumption of Okra fruits may be destructive to the testes and could impair male fertility. The studies, however, recommended further research on okra to establish its male reproductive safety. To further ascertain the relationship between okra and mens sexual health, we engaged experts in food science and Urology. Prof Adebanjor Badejo, a Food Science and Biotechnology specialist at the Federal University of Technology, FUTA, said there is a need for adequate research to establish that okra can cause male infertility or cure quick ejaculation. Igbo-Ora, a small town in Oyo State, has the highest dizygotic twinning rate. It has been estimated to be about 60 sets per 1000 births. Although the real cause of this phenomenon is uncertain, the residents generally believe their traditional diet of Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) may be responsible. However, this is yet to be established scientifically. Internet frenzy has also reported that okra water when taken, can increase libido in women. This is also lacking scientific data. Okra is rich in bioactive compounds such as carotene, folic acid, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin C, oxalic acid, and amino acids. All these are very good for health. Prof. Badejo, however, confirms that okra seeds contain gossypol, which is said to affect mens sperm production negatively. Okra seeds, in particular, contain gossypol. This is a pigment found in some plants that can act as an inhibitor of some enzymes. The presence of gossypol in okra has been reported to affect fertility negatively in men. The food scientist and biotechnologist stressed that as research progresses, more functions and roles of okra concerning human sexuality and fertility will be revealed. He concluded that More scientific research is needed to substantiate the claims. As long as research is ongoing, you dont conclude on what has not been discovered scientifically yet. Also speaking, Dr Olurotimi Ogundiniyi, a urologist consultant at Ondo State Ministry of Health and lecturer at the University of Medical Sciences, Ondo, said that research to determine the effects of okra on mens sexual health still lacks significance. He explained that Premature ejaculation is caused by psychological factors such as performance anxiety, stress, and underlying erectile dysfunction. Some hormonal imbalance also causes it. Many men will experience it at some point in time. It has nothing to do with diet, to the best of my knowledge. Okra cannot cure it. We eat okra a lot in Nigeria, but men still have premature ejaculation. Dr Ogundiniyi also concluded that more research needs to be done to ascertain the effect of okra on mens sexuality. The claim that Okra can be used to eliminate quick ejaculation cannot be substantiated as there is no scientific evidence to support it.

"Claim: A Facebook post claims the image of a military truck convoy was headed for SouthEast Nigeria. Dubawas findings show there is not enough evidence to ascertain what vehicles these are in the image and the location. On Monday June 7,2021, a Facebook user @Fola Adekeye shared the post of Akinde Oluwasogo which claimed military trucks in the image are heading to SouthEast Nigeria. Dubawa conducted multiple reverse image searches. Our Google reverse image search led to different Twitter posts. The first post by Major General Ezeaka Chidozie Ishola Buharideen ( @Ezeakachidozie ) shared an image of this convoy claiming A convoy of Nigerian Army logistics with a fleet of G12 Innoson guntrucks behind. This post was made on May 15, 2020 and has 20likes and 6 retweets. The second result of the google search led to the Twitter post on May 15, 2020 by Sam Hart ( @hartng ) hailing the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson vehicle with images of an Inosson truck and that of the Convoy in this claim. Kudos to the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson Vehicles. Note that the Nigerian Army orders the boots for its personnel from Aba. Excerpt of Harts Twitter post caption. Another result showed a Twitter post on August 28, 2020 by Innoson Vehicles ( @innosonvehicles ) speaking about its partnership to produce vehicles for the military but none of the images attached looked like the convoy image. Our google search also led to a Facebook post by History, News AnD FaCt villagers which hailed the Nigerian Army for patronising Innoson vehicles. In this post the image contained two vehicles, on the left was a truck with Innoson clearly written on it while on the right was the same truck shared by Mr Adekeye. A Tineyey search did not yield any result. Our Yandex reverse image search brought up different results. No match found One of Yandex search results led to a May 14, 2020 post on Chinas defense blog which described the struck as an IVM G12 utility vehicle (Gun jeep) in a military logistics vehicle. Another Yandex result led to a report by AutoJosh on May 15, 2020, noting these images were fighting vehicles produced by Innoson for the Nigerian Army. Going through the pictures we observed the trucks in the pictures were different from the convoy trucks alleged to be heading to the SouthEast. Dubawa also conducted an analysis of the image using the InVid tool and did not find any exif data or anything tangible to work with. Dubawa went ahead to research the IVM G12 military vehicle as one of the reverse image search revealed and found that the IVM G12 Military Vehicle is a variant of the 1/2 or 3/4 ton BJ2022 44 Brave Warrior Utility Vehicle manufactured by BAIC Motor under Beijing Auto Works (BAW). A look at pictures of the UVM G12 of Beijing and that of Innoson shows both trucks which are similar but look nothing like those alleged to be heading SouthEast. Screenshot of Beijing and Innoson IVM G12. Dubawas research and findings show there is not enough evidence to ascertain what vehicles these are in the image and the location of the image although we could ascertain the image is not new as it has been in circulation before 2021.",1
"Claim: A viral image showing different thumbprint positions classify some as valid and others as invalid. Verdict: FALSE . Our findings show all thumbprint positions shown in the image constitute valid votes. As February 25, 2023 election draws near, different information will be shared on voting to sensitise the public, but some of this information may be misleading. Recently, images of different fingerprints have been shared on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook on the right and wrong placement of the fingerprint. According to this image, only fingerprints within the fingerprint compartment in front of a partys logo are valid. That is, if your fingerprint crosses or touches the line of the compartment, it becomes invalid. While many believe this and have gone ahead to reshare, some Twitter users disagree with the fingerprint placement described as invalid, noting a persons vote only becomes invalid when it becomes difficult to determine which compartment it belongs to. The significance of this assertion and the need to clarify this confusion and set the records straight prompted us to verify. A fingerprint is an impression or mark made on a surface by the inner part of the top joint of the thumb. Its unique pattern of whorls and lines is used to identify individuals. Part four, section 52, subsection two, of the 2022 Electoral Act states that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) shall use indelible ink for any thumb mark by voters on ballot papers. Subsection one of this same part notes that Where a voter makes any writing or mark on a ballot paper by which he or she may be identified, the such ballot paper shall be rejected provided that any print resulting from the staining of the thumb of the voter in the voting compartment shall not be or be deemed to be a mark of identification. INEC has clarified that any finger can be used to thumbprint in the general election. According to INECs manual for election officers, indelible ink must be applied on the cuticle of the appropriate thumb/finger of the voters hand according to the type of election. For general elections, it would be applied to any of the applicable five fingers of a voter, but in the case of Stand-alone Elections, it would be applied to the left thumb of a voter). We reached out to INECs national commissioner for information, Festus Okoye, on the issue, and he shared the commissions 2022 manual for election officers. According to this manual, only thumbprints placed equally across two political parties compartments or on multiple compartments constitute an invalid vote. Ballots without any fingerprint or with the voters name in place of a thumbprint also constitute an invalid vote. On the other hand, fingerprints placed within a partys thumbprint compartment, on a partys logo, or between a partys logo and its thumbprint compartment constitute a valid vote. Voting at your polling unit on election day will follow this procedure : Step 1 Join the queue at your Polling Unit (PU), where an INEC official will check if you are at the correct polling unit and confirm that the permanent Voters Card (PVC) presented belongs to you. Step 2 An INEC official will confirm if your PVC is genuine using the card reader. You will also be asked to place your finger on the card reader. Step 3 An INEC official will ask for your PVC and confirm if you are listed on the Voters Register. Afterwards, your name will be ticked and indelible ink applied to the cuticle of your finger. Step 4 The Presiding officer will stamp, sign and endorse your ballot paper. You will be given the ballot paper rolled with the printed side inwards and directed to the voting cubicle. Step 5 Once in the cubicle, stain your finger with the ink given and mark the compartment for your preferred candidate/party. After this, you must roll the ballot paper in the manner you were given and flatten it. Step 6 Leave the voting cubicle and drop the ballot paper in the ballot box in full view of people at the PU. Step 7 Leave the PU or wait, if you so choose, in an orderly and peaceful manner, to watch the process up to the declaration of the result. Our findings show that all thumbprint positions in the viral image constitute valid votes, contrary to the assertion that some are valid while others are not.",0
"Claim: The youth league chair of the former ruling CDC has alleged that President Boakia won with less than 18,000 votes. Verdict: False! The final 2023 national presidential run-off election results show President Boakai won with over 20,000 votes. President Joseph Boakai is scheduled to report to Liberians on his one-year rule in a few days, according to Liberias Constitution. Article 58 of the 1986 Liberian constitution requires the President to report to the national legislature on the state of the Republic. Liberians are in high spirits about hearing from their leader and have begun discussing the presidents performance. Making comparisons between the first year of the rule of former President George Weah and the first year of President Boakai, the Youth League Chair of the former ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC), Emmanuel Johnson said that former President Weah reconciled the country, but his successor has failed to do the same. According to Johnson, even though he (Boakai) won with less than 18,000 votes, he has never taken any step to reconcile the country. He made the claim when he appeared as a guest on a radio programme . He can be heard at the 2:08:46 to 2:08:55 of the show. When writing this report, the show attracted 25.7K views, 551 comments, 309 reactions, and 75 shares. Since this claim delves into issues of political legitimacy, DUBAWA decided to check Johnsons assertions truthfulness. DUBAWA searched the National Elections Commissions official website to find the official results they announced. The final results from the 2023 run-off presidential election show President Joseph Boakai had 814,481 votes, constituting 50.64% of the total valid votes cast, while former President George Weah got 793,914, constituting 49.36%. President Boakai won with 20,567 votes. The CDC Youth League Chairpersons claim that President Boakai won with less than 18,000 votes is misleading.",0
"Claim: President Tinubu has made a national address announcing significant measures to reduce government expenditure, including the return of fuel and electricity subsidies. Verdict: A check by DUBAWA revealed that the viral claim is fabricated. A broadcast message on WhatsApp claims that President Tinubu has given a national address on reducing government expenditures. The post further claimed that the president has decided to take a 50% cut from his salary and called on the vice president and other top government officials to follow suit. More claims include scrapping the Office of the First Lady, selling some presidential aircraft, restoring subsidies on petrol and electricity, and prohibiting foreign medical treatments for government officials. The virality and potential impact of the claim prompted DUBAWA to fact-check it. DUBAWA conducted keyword searches and investigated national news outlets; however, we found no report about President Bola Tinubu addressing the nation recently. A look at the Facebook handle of the Federal Ministry of Information and National Orientation revealed no record of the supposed national address. We also looked at Mr Tinubus official Facebook page but couldnt find such an address. Further, DUBAWA checked the social media handles of the presidential aides, including Ajuri Ngalales X handle , the presidential spokespersons X handle, Bayo Onanugas X handle , and the handle of the special adviser on information and strategy. While we found no record of the said national address on Ajuris page, Onanuga recently debunked it , describing it as false. DUBAWAs investigation reveals that the claim is false. It is fabricated to mislead readers.

"Claim: A Twitter user, DEMAGOGUE PhD (@von_Bismack), posted a tweet claiming that the Nigerian government has cancelled the admission and training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). The claim that the Nigerian government has cancelled the admission and training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy is FALSE. On March 16, 2021, DEMAGOGUE PhD ( @von_Bismack ), a twitter user posted a tweet declaring that the Nigerian government has cancelled the admission and training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). The post reads This Government cancelled female cadets from NDA and our Feminists kept mute. If the topic is abt (sic) food, they all will rise like soaked garri but will go mute when their vileness is needed most. Within 48 hours, the tweet had garnered 297 retweets, 37 quote tweets and 577 likes. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on the admission process and eligibility of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA). Dubawa also studied the lists of successful candidates for admission into the NDA, since it began admission of female cadets in 2011 and discovered that the Academy has been admitting female cadets every year. Findings by Dubawa show that the Nigerian Defence Academy began the admission of female cadets in 2011, following a directive by the then President, Goodluck Jonathan GCFR. The first set of female cadets, nicknamed Jonathan Queens , numbering 20, were admitted into the 63 rd Regular Combatant Course (63RC) of the NDA in September 2011, alongside 155 male cadets. In October 2016, 19 female cadets of the 63RC graduated and were commissioned as officers in the Nigerian Armed Forces by President Muhammadu Buhari. Eligibility requirements for admission into the Nigerian Defence Academy as listed on the institutions official website , indicate that candidates eligible for admission into the institution must be single male or female without legal obligation to support any child or other individuals. It also states that candidates must NOT be less than 1.68 metres tall for male and 1.65 metres for female, also noting that admission into the Academy is for both male and female Nigerians only. The guidelines also indicate that the NDA has an annual cadets intake of 175 for the RC (regular course). This comprises 155 males and 20 females. An assessment of the list of successful candidates for admission into the NDA since 2011, when the admission female cadets began shows that the female cadets have been admitted into the NDA every year, since its 63 rd Regular Course in 2011. The then Defence Spokesperson (now Coordinator, Defence Media Operations), John Enenche, had also debunked reports about the stoppage of training female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy. Mr. Enenche, an Army Major General, described the report as disinformation to the general public by mischievous individuals. The contents of all those publications are ill-intended concoctions, not authentic and should therefore be disregarded outrightly. He noted that female cadets are eligible for all the types of commission that are grantable to their male counterparts, as provided by the terms and conditions of service of the Nigerian Armed Forces, which he said has not changed. Conclusion The claim that the Federal Government had cancelled the admission or training of female cadets at the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) is FALSE. Findings have revealed that since it started admitting female cadets in September 2011, the NDA has NEVER stopped the admission and training of female cadets, neither has there been any directives by the Federal Government for its cancellation.",0
"Claim: An Instagram user claims using AirPods frequently can cause brain cancer. Verdict: Insufficient evidence! Experts say there is no evidence to link Airpods with brain cancer. Other studies also prove the need for larger and more studies. In recent years, the popularity of wireless earbuds, particularly Apples AirPods, has skyrocketed. With their sleek design and convenient wireless capabilities, these devices have become a staple for millions worldwide. However, along with their popularity, concerns have emerged regarding their safety. One of the most pressing questions is whether the radiofrequency (RF) radiation emitted by AirPods could cause brain cancer. Instablog posted a video of a woman on their Instagram page talking about a stranger warning her about the dangers of using Airpods. The man stated that constant use of gadgets can affect the brain because of the radiation signals it sends to the brain. In the video, the woman explained that a stranger had warned her not to wear Airpods as it has the power to cause cancer. Since it was posted on June 18, 2024, the claim has garnered 1,265 comments and 4,340 shares. It can also be found on Facebook here , here , and on X . This fact check aims to explore the scientific evidence surrounding this issue. The virality and controversy on the subject made DUBAWA verify the claim. According to Healthline , the strength of radiation released by Bluetooth headsets is significantly lower than that of cellphones, X-rays, or ultraviolet light. Wireless devices produce non-ionising radiation, which is too weak to remove electrons from atoms. The amount of radiation released by Bluetooth devices is relatively low compared to cell phones. A study done in 2019 also showed that the amount of radiation in Bluetooth headsets was 10 to 400 times lower than phone radiation, showing no evidence that Apple AirPods or other Bluetooth devices cause cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed electromagnetic radiation released by cellphones and Bluetooth devices as potentially cancer-causing, but more research needs to come out to examine if the levels of radiation are strong enough to damage human health. Currently, no evidence using Apple AirPods or other wireless headphones increases ones risk of brain cancer. Bluetooth earbuds produce less radiation than cellphones, even though they are so close to the brain. However, some health experts warn that more research is needed to examine their long-term effects. Experts approached by Medscape Medical News had different opinions. AirPods use standard 0.01-watt Bluetooth, said Kenneth Foster , PhD, a professor of bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. A cell phone transmits 0.1-1 watts, and FCC records indicate that radio-frequency exposure from AirPods is far below their limits for cell phones, and those measurements were done under worst-case conditions that far overstate actual exposure under real-world circumstances. American Cancer Centre also suggests that studies of people published so far have not established a clear link between cell phone use and the development of tumours. However, these studies have had some important limitations that make them unlikely to end the controversy about whether cell phone use affects cancer risk. Mary Idowu, an ear, nose, and throat specialist (ENT), explained that AirPods can not cause cancer. In our scope of research, we have not seen any evidence that supports that. From my point of view, frequent loud sounds from the AirPods can cause problems, but I can not say that they can cause cancer. She also explained that the immediate tissue being exposed to radiation should be considered first before thinking if Airpods can cause brain cancer. Ms Idowu warned that people should reduce loud sounds when listening to music as it can potentially damage the ear drums. Another ENT specialist, who preferred to be known as Adeyinka, dismissed the claim as untrue. In his conversation with DUBAWA, he said he had never treated anyone with any disease linked to Airpods. To put it simply, no. Its very unlikely that AirPods cause cancer, he concluded. There is no evidence to prove any linkage between AirPods and brain cancer. Experts warn that loud music can cause hearing loss, but no studies have yet proved that using AirPods can cause brain cancer.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user has alleged on the Facebook groups Costa Show that Senator Abraham Dillon of Montserrado County was distributing meals at the Korea-Africa Summit. Verdict : Misleading! The fact-check conducted with Google Reverse Image Search and Bing revealed that the image used was first posted on January 9, 2022, by Diamond Online and Inside Grand Gedeh with different narratives. The photo has nothing to do with the Africa-Korea Summit. President Joseph Boakai led a delegation from Liberia to attend the Korea-Africa Summit in Seoul, South Korea, from June 4 to 5, 2024. Senator Abraham Dillon, Chairman of the Liberian Senates Foreign Affairs Committee, was among the delegation. The event was the first summit organised between African countries and the Republic of Korea. It lasted two days and focused on ways and prospects for enhancing the partnership between the African countries and Korea. However, on June 10, 2024, a social media user, Mohammed Keita, posted in the Costa Show (Facebook group) , claiming that Senator Dillon left his duty at the summit and engaged in distributing meals. The claimant added that the lawmaker came back with nothing from the occasion. So this is what you were doing in South Korea at the Africa Business Summit. (You were doing) distribution of food, and you come back with Vlahhh in the country, the post said. The post generated 94 comments and 53 reactions at the time of this writing. In the comment section, social media users stated that the post was false, while some supported the posters claim. This confusion led DUBAWA to conduct a fact check. DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search to trace the images origin. The results show that two blogs in Liberia posted the image on January 9, 2024. In their separate posts, the blogs Diamond Online and Inside Grand Gedeh alleged that the Senator was spotted hanging out for meals at a local party. DUBAWA browsed the comment section on these blogs to research further about the image. During the process, DUBAWA came across a few comments linking the picture of the Senator holding two plates of rice to a Thanksgiving gathering he hosted for his supporters in 2022. The comments added that the caterers found it difficult to distribute meals to the guests during the occasion, prompting the Senator to assist. Screenshot below Meanwhile, DUBAWA also contacted Senator Abraham Darius Dillon on the claim but didnt get a reply as of this publication. Based on our findings, the image posted by the claimant is unrelated to the summit.",1
"Claim: The current opposition [members] are all former government officials, said Jefferson Koijee, the Mayor of Monrovia and Secretary of Mr Weahs Congress for Democratic Change. Verdict: False. Checks by DUBAWA and interviews with some opposition members indicate that not all have been in government. Monrovias Mayor Jefferson Koijee has told a gathering of intellectuals that the current opposition seeking to dethrone incumbent President Weah are all former government officials. The Mayors statement comes in the wake of opposition slogans that Liberia needs to be rescued from the hands of Mr Weah. But Mr Koijee questioned the authenticity of the different slogans claiming that the opposition members are former government officials who had the opportunity to serve but failed to deliver the country at the time of service. Look at the current opposition; they are all former government officials. When we were in opposition, we never had former government [officials in] opposition, said the Mayor. With five months to go for the October 10 Presidential and Legislative elections, the message for votes is taking diverse trends. The Mayors video has since attracted varied opinions. Given his place as Mayor and his role in the countrys governance structure, his words and comments are important in the lead-up to the election. DUBAWA decided to investigate if all the opposition members were once government officials. Mayor Koijee, the Secretary of the Congress for Democratic Change, a constituent party within the ruling Coalition, made the statement on Saturday, May 27, 2023, at an Intellectual Center. He made the particular claim around the 28 mins of his assertion that spanned for 31:53sec. Government officials are people elected or appointed to administer a government . Like the Vocabulary Dictionary, the Free Dictionary shares the same definition . To serve in government is to be allowed to improve the lives of citizens. If the claim by Mayor Koijee is true, then it means all the opposition members who now seek to govern once had the opportunity to improve the peoples lives but failed to do so. So DUBAWA decided to investigate if the claim was true. When contacted, some members of the opposition community in Liberia rejected the claim from the Mayor of Monrovia and the Secretary of the CDC. Nelsco Wolo , National Vice Chairman for Mobilization and Recruitment of the Opposition Movement for Democracy and Reconstruction (MDR), is a party headed by Senator Jeremiah Koung, now a running mate to Amb. Joseph Boakai of the Unity Party clarified that he has not worked in government. In a conversation with DUBAWA, he said: I am not a former government official; for me, I havent been a government official. The Mayor should be able to define his motive behind the statement. The opposition Unity Party National Vice Chair for Inter-Party Relations and National Elections Commission Affairs, Cornelius Kruah-Togba , in a conversation with DUBAWA, also clarified that she was neither appointed nor elected by the President nor the electorate and can, therefore, not be said to have worked in government before. Another opposition leader, Aloysius Toe, the Secretary General of the Collaborating Political Parties (CPP), said the claim that all opposition members are former government members is untrue. Alexander Cummings, the leader of the CPP, has not served as a government official. I am Aloysius Toe. I am the secretary of the CPP. I have not worked in government since my existence, said Toe. The Mayor, however, declined to substantiate his claim against the opposition members despite efforts by DUBAWA to get him to substantiate his claim. : The claim by the Mayor of Monrovia that all members of the opposition in Liberia are all former governments is false! Investigation proved that some opposition members are not former government officials.",0
"CLAIM: Social media user @JohnFanimokun shared a video claiming All Progressives Grand Alliance and Labour Party supporters clashed in Anambra state on Saturday. FINDING: Using Google Earth, the NFC performed a geo-location on the video and discovered it was captured at Shadia Onanuga street, Abule-Ado, in Lagos state. Also, an INVID analysis of the video showed that it appeared recently during the elections. Also, the female voice-over alleged that the violence distracted voters.

"Claim: The Minister of Health, Dr Louise Kpoto, in an appearance before the Plenary of the House of Representatives, claimed that Liberia has the lowest rate of HIV/AIDS among African Countries. Verdict: Misleading! Findings from UNAIDS reveal that Liberia has a relatively low HIV/AIDS rate of 0.9%, but it isnt the lowest among African Countries. Algeria and Egypt have 0.1% of HIV/AIDS rates. The Minister of Health, Dr Louise Kpoto, and Liberias Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Thomas Cooper, appeared before the Plenary of the House of Representatives on Tuesday, February 4, to discuss critical issues being experienced in the health sector. The two Health officials were invited to provide reasons for the increased rate of maternal death, the alleged charging of patients to pay certain fees before they can be catered for at public health facilities, and the reassignment of Medical Doctors to the position of County Health Officers. Rep. Isaac Bannie of District #1 Grand Bassa County backed the communication preferred by Rep. Thomas A. Goshua of District #5. Grand Bassa County. Rep. Goshua stressed the use of a single syringe by drug dealers that is causing a high increase in infectious diseases. The Representative made mention of HIV/AIDS and hepatitis as dangerous diseases that have spread amongst the young populace lately. In the Ministers response to their inquiries, she said, unlike hepatitis, Liberia has the lowest HIV/AIDS rate amongst other African Countries. Minister Kpoto, comparing Liberias HIV/AIDS status to Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and other African Countries, said Liberia has the lowest. In Liberia, the HIV rate is low among our African Countries. Its 1.5%, and sometimes it goes to 1.2% comparatively. In the Ivory Coast, comparatively, it is 2.9%. If you go to Nigeria, the percentage is higher than in Liberia, Dr Kpoto said. Upon her statement, lawmakers in session argued that she wasnt providing correct information for their questions. They requested that the hearing be adjourned and that she appear in the Committees room with documentation for her answers. The claim is found on the OKFM Facebook page . It can be found between 33:36 to 34:50 mins. The back and forth on the accuracy of the information led DUBAWA to initiate a fact-check. Verification DUBAWA researched various documents about countries and their HIV/AIDS statuses in Africa. During the process, findings show that Liberia is part of countries with HIV rates below 1%, but it isnt the lowest. Countries like Egypt and Algeria have 0.1% HIV/AIDS rate while Liberia has 0.9%. Statistics from UNAIDS and World Population Review indicate that Liberia stands at 0.9% while Algeria and Egypt stand at 0.1% on HIV/AIDS status. Compared to other countries in the region, Nigeria =1.4%, Guinea=1.4%, Sierra Leone =1.3%, Ghana=1.5%, Ivory Coast =2.2% A screenshot of World population review data on countries and HIV. Screenshot of UNAIDS HIV/AIDS rate in Liberia and countries with the lowest HIV rates. Conclusion From our findings, Liberia is one of the countries with a low HIV/AIDS rate in the region, but it isnt the lowest among African countries. Therefore, the claim is misleading.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claims the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has revealed the first sample of the N5000 note, which features President Tinubus image. Verdict: False! No report indicates the CBN recently introduced N5000 notes. Moreover, an analysis of the note shows that it was AI-generated. On Friday, Feb. 7, 2025, a blog page, 9Njablog , shared a picture of a new N5000 currency denomination featuring President Bola Tinubu and claimed it was recently unveiled by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). Alongside the image of the alleged new currency, the Facebook user wrote, The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has unveiled the first sample of the N5000 note, which will soon be distributed to banks. The note features a portrait of President Bola Ahmed Tinubu. According to the CBN Governor, this decision honours Tinubu for his commendable contributions during his presidency. he wrote further. The post has attracted 10 reactions and 10 comments and has been reposted 10 times as of Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Several users on Facebook shared the image with a similar narrative as seen here , here , here , and here . DUBAWAs decision to investigate the claim because of the economic and political implications of the claim for Nigerias territorial integrity. DUBAWA conducted an extensive keyword search to determine whether the CBN has recently unveiled a new currency in Nigeria but found no report to validate the assertion. Investigating further, DUBAWA checked the CBNs official website , but there was no report that it launched any new currency. Furthermore, DUBAWA combed through the CBNs X and Facebook pages but found no post or image corroborating the claimants assertion. So, we tried to find the origin of the image used by the claimant. We subjected the image to an AI detector tool, Hive Moderation, which showed that it contained 94.9 per cent AI material. Using another image verification tool, AI detects content.com ., which reveals that the image has a 61% AI influence. We checked his official X handle since President Tinubu is attached to the claim. Still, we found no post or information about him being featured in any naira note or CBN introducing a new currency. We also did not find any such development reported by credible media outlets. DUBAWA also contacted the bank via its social media handles (Facebook and X). While we received no response from Facebook, its X page was inaccessible. Our investigation reveals that the CBN did not introduce a new currency or initiate any discussion about creating a 5,000 naira note. Additionally, the image shared by the claimant is AI-generated.",0
"Claim : President-elect Joseph Boakai has vowed to tackle corruption in his administration. This message has gone viral on social media chatrooms and was on the GNN news website. Verdict : Misleading! Our findings show that it is an old statement posted by Amb. Boakai on July 12, 2023, on his Facebook page before the heat of the 2023 general elections. Also, GNN has deleted the publication on its website, while the Unity Party has released a disclaimer on the statement in circulation. The National Elections Commission (NEC) has declared opposition leader Joseph Boakai the winner of the run-off elections in Liberia. Boakai won with 814,428 votes, representing 50.64% of the total votes cast, with the incumbent George Weah polling 793,910, representing 49.36 of the votes. Before NEC declared Boakai a winner of the polls, President George Weah called to concede defeat to his rival. However, on Sunday, Nov 19, 2023, the GNN newspaper published a statement purporting to be from Boakai in his capacity as president-elect on its website. The statement titled: Special statement by Amb. Joseph Nyumah Boakai Sr, Standard Bearer, Unity Party and President-elect, Republic of Liberia talks about targeting corruption from the first day of his administration. The statements highlight ways and strategies the Boakai government intends to fight corruption and prosecute corrupt leaders of the Weah administration. The message triggered some controversy among Liberians. In verifying this claim, DUBAWA discovered that GNN had deleted the article from their website a few hours after circulation. In addition, the statement was posted by Amb. Boakai on July 12, 2023 , but without the heading as President-elect. At the time, the 2023 electoral process was yet to commence fully. To further debunk the content of the new statement that has gone viral, the Unity Party, on Nov. 19, 2023, released a disclaimer on the report in circulation. The statement posted via Secretary General Amos Twehs Facebook page clarified that the information was false. After DUBAWAs verification, it is proven that the statement circulating about Amb. Boakai has been manipulated.",1
"CLAIM: Peter Obi jets out to London over health issues. VERDICT: FALSE. The spokesperson of the Labour Party, Yunusa Tanko, revealed that although Mr Obi travelled to London, it was not health-related and he is back in the country. As it has become the norm , however disapproving, top Nigerian politicians ignore Nigerian hospitals and seek healthcare abroad. A Twitter user, Chigozirim Emeakayi ( @GoziconC ) , asserted that the 2023 presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, has flown to London due to personal health challenges. Chigozirim, who had made the post on Wednesday morning, April 12, 2023, wrote, Breaking Peter Obi jets out to London over health issues. I wish him a quick recovery. The tweet came amidst the ongoing controversy surrounding the detainment or detention of Mr Obi at Heathrow Airport in London. The incident sparked mixed reactions outrage for most of it, from netizens on social media. As of Friday, April 14, 2023, Chigozirims tweet had garnered over 131 thousand views, 147 retweets, 24 quoted tweets, and 1,098 likes. However, in the comment section, some Twitter users questioned the accuracy of the tweet. Tweep, LP J. O. M. ( @drjeff60 ) countered the claim by posting a previous tweet by Mr Obi stating that he had been present at the official opening of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Specialist Hospital and St Charles Borromeo hospital, both in Nkpor local government of Anambra State. Another Twitter user, Opeyemi ( @mrpacavelli ), rebuffed the veracity of the tweet, declaring that the 2023 LP presidential candidate would rather take health treatment in a local government in Nigeria than have it abroad. Although there were people who disbelieved the claim, others like Omoba Segvil ( @Segvill247 ) queried why Mr Obi would not treat himself in Anambra State, where he had been a two-time executive governor or even any of the eastern state Another tweep, Aliyu Yahya ( @cowboybabba ), suggested that Mr Obi should go in the company of Arise Television morning host presenter Rufai Oseni, who, according to him, looks sick. Due to the tweets controversy, DUBAWA investigated the claims authenticity. Searches on Google related to the context of the claim showed no report that Mr Obi flew to London to get treatment. Available reports by The Guardian , Premium Times , and Daily Post only showed that Mr Obi travelled to London for the Easter break and was detained at Heathrow airport. All reports indicated that this happened on Friday, April 7, 2023. We found a tweet posted by the LP presidential candidate on Tuesday, April 11, 2023, revealing that he had been in Nkpor, Anambra State, for an official opening of two new hospitals. The launch of these hospitals was reported to have occurred on Tuesday. We contacted Mr Obi and his spokesperson, Valentine Obienyem, via phone calls and messages, but none responded. We went ahead to reach the spokesperson of the LP, Yunusa Tanko, who revealed that although Mr Obi had indeed travelled to London, he had returned. When DUBAWA inquired from him if Mr Obi had travelled for medical reasons, the LP spokesperson refuted this claim. Our findings and comments from the LP spokesperson showed that although Mr Obi was in London recently, the claim is false.",0
"At the eleventh GlobalFact meetinga worldwide gathering of fact-checking organisationsheld in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, members of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) have openly declared their commitment to access to information and freedom of expression for all people across international territories. In the Sarajevo Statement , the global group clamoured for unhindered access to, reception of, and optimum use of information and ideas, emphasising the core principles of the fact-checking foundation. All people have the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Fact-checking is deeply rooted in these principles. Fact-checking requires the right and ability to find sources, read widely and interview experts who are free to speak candidly all as part of a rigorous methodology and process. This is the foundation on which all true fact-checking is built, part of the statement reads. The fact-checking group, comprising 130 fact-checking organisations across 80 countries, highlighted its focus on providing evidence-backed information to clarify assertions and public statements that are false, misleading or put out of context. It further argues that the initiative of fact-checking is not to erase public posts and assertions but to make them useful during public debate, backed up with evidence, that only makes facts presented in such debates accurate. The statement is also a critical reaction to the persistent attack on fact-checkers, who have, over the years, been viewed as online censors and constantly abused verbally, doxed, victimised, threatened legally and politically, and even assaulted physically. However, the IFCN hoped to correct the notion that fact-checking is an instrument of censorship but rather an initiative that only seeks to give out information for clarity. In a separate report , the IFCN explained that fact-checking organisations have been made to bear the brunt of such hostilities. Among notable incidents is the Georgian parliament labelling civil society and media organisations as foreign agents. Myth Detector and FactCheck Georgia have constantly been targeted, with the formers offices vandalised. Meanwhile, Kate Starbird, a leading researcher at the University of Washington in the United States, has received death threats amidst political and legal attacks on the misinformation research community. While in Brazil, fact-checking journalists at Aos Fatos were sued due to a 2020 report on online misinformation, the Philippines-based news agency Rappler has suffered constant attacks despite the governments unsuccessful attempts to shut down its operations. Also, in 2020, PolitiFact, Science Feedback and the Poynter Institute were all sued in federal court by Robert Kennedy Jr.s Childrens Health Defense for fact-checking COVID-19 vaccine misinformation. Arguments have continued to linger about how media and online platforms manage public expression, how tech companies moderate public posts, and societys behaviour toward harmful speech. Although it is only right that harmful expressions and posts should be quickly erased, false claims should not be removed for their lack of integrity. Still, appropriate contexts should be given to educate society. This also spotlights how untrue certain pieces of information are and the essence of fact-checking processes. With the influx of artificial intelligence in contemporary times, it is only necessary that fact-checking organisations are allowed to step in to sanitise the information space. Moreover, because both the public and government need accurate information for their decisions in matters relating to economics, health, foreign policies, etc., fact-checking initiatives need to be embraced rather than opposed to safeguarding the information ecosystem.",1
"Claim: The former Deputy Commerce Minister claimed that Liberias former President Weah never fired anybody during his administration. Verdict: False. President Weah fired Dr Mosoka Fallah, Wilmot Smith, and even Jamima Wolokolie during his administration. The news that President Joseph Boakai suspended all government officials who did not declare their assets has been met with mixed reactions. However, Madam Jamima Wolokolie , former Deputy Minister of Commerce during the Weah-led administration, believes the presidents action is appropriate. According to Madam Wolokollie, Boakai is doing the right thing by suspending non-compliant government officials. She said the President did what his predecessor, former George Weah, did not. She also claimed that Weah was too lenient during his administration, saying, he never fired anybody. She made the claim from 2:32:53 to 1:33:03 on an afternoon radio show on OK FM. DUBAWA verified Madam Wolokolies claim due to its potential to mislead and misinform. DUBAWA found that two years into his administration, on Sept. 4, 2020, former President George Weah dismissed Dr Mosoka Fallah, the former head of the National Public Health Institute of Liberia. Over a year later, Weah sacked two executives of the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services. DUBAWA also found that even Madam Jamima Wolokolie was among the people former President Weah fired during his administration. Jamima Wolokolies claim that former President Weah did not fire anyone during his administration is false.",1
"CLAIM: A viral post shared on WhatsApp states that to ensure safety in the kitchen, people should always have a bottle of coke or pepsi in the fridge to quench fire. Yes. Coke or Pepsi have fire quenching components of fire extinguishers but experts warn against using them as extinguishers, thus making the claim to be Partly True. Recently, a message went viral on WhatsApp claiming a number of things. In one of the claims, it was recommended that using soft drinks, coca-cola or Pepsi, to put out a fire is recommended. The long message which was supposed to give safety tips to Nigerians reads, I want to believe that some of us watched NTA News yesterday and saw the agony of the man whose wife was supposed to put to bed in a months time but lost her life to snakebite in Kikinau, Kaduna state. Reason for this post this morning. Another section of the post also focused on snakes and the use of salt to chase them away from ones toilet and environs. Another claim was the mention that one or two bottles of coca-cola could help to put out a fire. The post claimed, KITCHEN SAFETY *Keep 1 or 2 bottles of Coca-Cola or Pepsi in the Kitchen. Should a sudden fire occur, just open the bottle,shake it quickly & spray on to the fire.Please share this to everyone you know* Hello dear, dont keep it to yourself please. The post which was widely shared on WhatsApp showed that the message had been forwarded many times as the writer had earlier implored people to share and not hoard such important information. Considering the importance of safety in homes, it is important to examine the components of a Coke/Pepsi in relation to that of a fire extinguisher. Coke and Pepsi are carbonated soft drinks. According to the official website of Pepsi, pepsi.co.uk, Pepsi , comprises carbonated water, sugar, colour (caramel E150d), acid (phosphoric acid), flavourings (including caffeine). Just like Pepsi, Coke is made of the following components and proportions: Carbonated water Approximately 90% of Coca-Cola is water. The carbonated part is purified carbon dioxide, which gives the drink its bubbles or fizz. Sugar Coca-Cola Classics sweet taste (and also some of its mouthfeel) come from sugar. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke are sugar-free. Caramel colour A very specific caramel is made especially for Coca-Cola, to give the drink its characteristic colour. Phosphoric Acid The tartness of Coca-Cola comes from the use of phosphoric acid. Caffeine The slight bitterness in the taste of Coca-Cola comes from caffeine Natural flavours The essence of the secret formula of Coca-Cola is its blend of natural flavours. This is the most protected and secret part of the formula. Fire extinguishers on the other hand, according to William L. Grosshandler, leader of the Fire Sensing and Extinguishment Group in the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, contain different chemicals, depending on the application. Handheld extinguishers, which are commonly sold at hardware stores for use in the kitchen or garage, are pressurized with nitrogen or carbon dioxide (CO2) to propel a stream of fire-squelching agents to domestic fire. The active material may be a powder such as potassium bicarbonate (KHCO3), liquid water, an evaporating fluorocarbon or the propelling agent itself. The most effective and common fluorocarbon used until recently for this application had been bromochlorodifluoromethane (CF2ClBr), referred to as halon 1211. By international agreement, however, production of all types of halons ceased in 1994 because the bromine and chlorine atoms in the chemical were found to migrate over time to the stratosphere, where they react to deplete ozone in a very efficient catalytic cycle. Although some online sources claim that some soft drinks douse simple fires, experts refuse to confirm if the claim was true or false. The Managing Director, Safety Consultants Solutions Provider, Mrs Anthonia Beri, said she wouldnt confirm anything unscientific because I dont want anyone going to try anything funny at home, especially because of the sensitivity of safety-related issues. She said, I will not subscribe to such activity because every industry or profession has a principle behind it. In the kitchen, youre supposed to have a fire blanket because most of your fire is coming from your stove. The Best thing that you need to do is to throw a fire blanket over it or if you can, it is even better to take a wet bag and put it over there. So, it is cold and it suffocates the fire. Beri said the stories and claims around using soft drinks to extinguish fire should be ignored. She added, The story of coke and all that used to put out fire isnt an acceptable principle. I will personally say get an extinguisher or a fire blanket. I will never confirm a thing like that if youre fighting a pure fire, greasy fire. Fire has different characteristics, for example, it could be a petroleum fire, a gas fire and youre trying to use coke or Pepsi. Such a thing shouldnt be encouraged. In the same vein, the Director of the Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service, Mrs Margaret Adeseye, told our correspondent that she does not support using coke and Pepsi as ingredients for putting out a fire. She said, Professionally, I will not be in support of using carbonated drinks for putting out fire. If I may ask, how many bottles of Coke or Pepsi in terms of quantity will be enough to fight a fire. Adeseye asked if it was the water in the content or the chemical composition that made it suitable for fighting fire: In terms of the content, is it the water inside the coke or the chemical that fought the fire? I know the one in the breakable bottle has more water composition or if it was the chemical inside it, then if it is the chemical, it should contain Carbon dioxide and Nitrogen to mention a few of the most effective agents to fight fire. Adeseye, however, advised that people should get fire extinguishers to be used to put out the fire especially in the homes. She said, People should get fire extinguishers to fight fires. Fire extinguishers and these soft drinks have similar ingredients which are water and carbon dioxide which can serve as fire squelching ingredients. Confirming, Adeseye also said the major ingredients in a fire extinguisher are water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen and that the ingredients have also been confirmed to be present in both Coke and Pepsi. Also, a professor Emeritus of Public Health at the Ryerson University, Timothy Sly, on Quora , a social question-and-answer website, said the water component of both soft drinks can put out fire. He added, Yes, but its the water part that effectively douses the flames. If the bottle is shaken, the CO2 (Carbon dioxide) can help propel the water toward the conflagration. There are CO2 extinguishers, of course, and they discharge CO2 toward an electrical or class B fire. A lso, a Deputy Chief Officer of the Department of Delhi Fire Services, who stated that the bottled drinks have several chemicals which are similar to that of fire extinguishers . He stated, It might douse simple fires because its liquid and reduces the heat but we would never use a Coca-Cola bottle to extinguish fires. The origin of fire is essential in determining which agent to use to stop the fire. Rather than keeping a stock of soda bottles, its advisable to keep a bucket of water for emergencies. Yes. Coke or Pepsi may have fire quenching components of fire extinguishers,but experts warn against using them as extinguishers.

"Claim: Shine Liberia reported that LPRC Managing Director Amos Tweh purchased a USD 150K house shortly after his appointment. Verdict: Misleading. Shine Liberia could not prove its accusation with evidence. Tweh, however, has debunked the claim. Amos Tweh, the new Managing Director of the Liberia Petroleum Refinery Company (LPRC), has been accused of purchasing a house valued at US$150,000 just weeks after his appointment. One of Liberias social media blogs, Shine Liberia , made this claim. According to the report, Amos house is currently at the lintel level. Shine Liberia also suggested that the new LPRC MDs decision to buy the house ensures he acquires property early enough, as he fears President Boakai will not return in 2029. You must do everything to get more properties and money to take care of you for the rest of your life, said Shine Liberia. The claim, made on March 16, 2024, has generated over 1.1k comments, 1k emojis, and 83 shares. In the face of the growing public interest, we at DUBAWA decided to fact-check the information. Firstly, the researcher demanded pieces of evidence from Shine Liberia via Messenger to provide better details about the claims. However, there has since been no response. For his part, the new LPRC MD, Amos Tweh , dismissed the claim by describing it as Nonsense. Tweh wrote on his official Facebook page: Pekin, you and your sponsors need to try harder. For the public good, let me state that in 2013, I acquired 1.9 plots of land in Caldwell to build a residential area. He said he mobilized his meager resources and started the project in 2014, partially completing the ground floor and moving in around 2019. I have been living here for almost five years now. I am told in your usual anger-ranting and smear campaign against my person. You are insinuating that after my appointment as Managing Director of LPRC, I immediately bought this house at a cost of 150k. Nonsense! According to Mr Tweh, the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) records him paying real estate tax on this property for the last few years. He further stated that the UP government has a firm policy focusing on public service integrity. If you know me too well, you will never contemplate writing such trash, he added. Weeks after Twehs denial, Shine Liberia has yet to substantiate the claim against the LPRC boss with evidence. DUBAWA proceeded to the Liberia Revenue Authority, asking for evidence of Mr Twehs property tax payment. However, the Authority, through its communication, did not confirm or deny Twehs disclosure that the Revenue Authority has a record of his tax history. The law forbids me from providing such information to you, Kaiheneh Sengbeh , the LRAs communication manager, told DUBAWA. The countrys Revenue Code of 2000 as Amended 2011, particularly Part 1, Chapter 1, subchapter B, Section 54 (a), (b) and forbids officials of the LRA from sharing taxpayerss information in their possession with third parties unless such party has authority over tax matters. Sengbeh: If another journalist were to ask me for your tax information, I would not reveal the same. Though the Revenue Authority wouldnt say how much he is paying on the property or when he started payment, Amos shared pictures of the house with DUBAWA from years ago when it was under construction. Here are the house photographs: I His statement was corroborated by another resident of the community who, upon hearing information that Amos had purchased a new house weeks after his appointment by the President, said on Facebook: Shine Liberia is spreading false and misleading information about Honorable Amos B. Tweh, Anthony J. Wah said . The land was purchased in 2013, and by 2014, construction work began, and by the middle of 2019, the entire ground floor and portion of the first floor was completed. Let it be clear here that Honourable Tweh didnt buy any property while serving as Managing Director of LPRC. In addition, Mr Wah also passed a messenger conversation he had in 2017 with Tweh during the construction of the building. See screenshot below: Based on our investigation, including Shine Liberias failure to respond to our inquiries and the clarity of the accused, the claim lacks the semblance of truth and is, therefore, misleading.",1
"Claim: Drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes. The claim that drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes is misleading as it is yet to be scientifically and medically proven. On August 1, 2021, a Facebook user Aramide health tips posted a claim that drinking okra water first thing in the morning treated diabetes. In the post, it was claimed that okra contains insulin-like properties, which are beneficial for the treatment of diabetes. Okra water helps to reduce the sugar level in the blood. Meanwhile, some people have suggested that drinking okra water helps lessen diabetes symptoms. The drink is made by putting okra pods in water and soaking them overnight. Some of the valuable nutrients in the skin and seed pods will be absorbed by the water. What is Okra? Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus Hibiscus esculentus Linn) known by some as ladys fingers or gumbo is a flowering plant in the mallow family. It is an annual herb that is widely cultivated for its edible green seed pods in tropical, subtropical and warm temperate climates. Okra is also a good source of minerals, vitamins, antioxidants and fiber; it contains a sticky juice that people use to thicken sauces. It is an essential crop in many countries due to its high nutritional value. Also, people can use many parts of the plant including the fresh leaves, buds, flowers, pods, stems and seeds. Nutritional Components of Okra According to the U.S department of Agriculture (USDA) National Nutrient Database , one cup of raw okra, weighing 100 grams (g) contains: 33 calories 1.9 grams of protein 0.2 grams of fat 7.5 grams of carbohydrates 3.2 grams of fiber 1.5 grams of sugar 31.3 milligrams (mg) of vitamin K 299 milligrams of potassium 7 milligrams of sodium 23 milligrams of vitamin C 0.2 milligrams of thiamin 57 milligrams of magnesium 82 milligrams of calcium 0.215 milligrams of vitamin B6 60 micrograms (mcg) of folate 36 micrograms of vitamin A Okra also provides some iron, niacin, phosphorus and copper. Generally, Okra is a high-value crop because it represents a source of nutrients that are important to human health, e.g., vitamins, potassium, calcium and unsaturated fatty acids such as (inolenic and oleic acids) among others. However, evidence of okra having anti-diabetic properties has increased in recent years with multiple vito (laboratory) and vivo (animal) studies confirming okra as a potent blood glucose-lowering (or anti diabetic) food. And one of such is a Facebook post by Aramide health tips claiming that drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces and insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar. The various types of diabetes include: type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, monogenic diabetes and cystic fibrosis related diabetes. Over time, having too much glucose in ones blood can cause serious problems. It can damage the eyes, kidneys and nerves. Diabetes can also cause heart disease, stroke and even the need to remove a limb. It should be of note that various studies have been done on the effectiveness of okra in treating diabetes, but only on animals and there are no conclusive research of its impact on humans. A Nutritionist, Tolu Arowolo, said it is a well known fact that okra has good nutritional value as a vegetable, but nothing has been ascertained yet about its insulin-like properties. She said, Although, I have heard the claim that drinking okra water in the morning treats diabetes, what nutritionists are aware of is that it is a good vegetable with high nutritional value. A medical practitioner, Dr. Ademola Ayodele, said the claim that diabetes can be treated by drinking okra in the morning is medically not feasible. According to him, Medically, such a claim is not only doubtful but can be easily argued against. First, we need to understand what causes diabetes, it is said to be a relative or absolute lack of insulin. Now, okra is not going to reduce insulin, so how will it treat diabetes? Perhaps, if explored further, there may be some benefits in terms of managing the complications, but the main treatment for now remains, either the production or supplement of insulin or to have a drug that will make the insulin which is in the body to be more effective. So, that claim can never be approved by any medical practitioner. A Consultant Endocrinologist with the University of Science Teaching Hospital, Ondo (UNIMED), Dr Adenike Enikuomehin, said the claim that drinking okra water in the morning treats diabetes is false as it is yet to be scientifically proven. She said, No, if you take green okra, it is good for you as a vegetable, but it does not treat or cure diabetes and thats why we have so many complications of diabetes coming to us in the hospitals. Because, they would follow things they see online and later this leads to complications. And so, there is nothing like that, scientifically that claim is yet to be proven and there is nothing like such medically. I will advise that people dont do this, so as to avoid presenting themselves in the hospitals with eye, kidney and heart complications among others. The claim that drinking okra water treats diabetes is false. The claim that drinking okra water first thing in the morning treats diabetes is misleading as it is yet to be proven medically and scientifically that okra has properties that can be used to treat diabetes.

"Claim: Martin Kollie alleges that President Boakai spent US$1.8M on celebrations when over 25,000 students from the University of Liberia and MVTC stayed out of school while lecturers were on a go-slow strike. Verdict: False. DUBAWAs investigation into the 2024 National Budget found no evidence supporting Martin Kollies claim. The approved budget allocates only $200,000 for celebrations, not $1.8 million, as alleged. As the 2024 fiscal year draws closer, the Government of Liberia reportedly struggles to meet certain budgetary commitments, particularly for Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions like the Monrovia Vocational Training Center (MVTC). This situation has led to protests and go-slow actions by lecturers and students, urging the Boakai administration to address the issue. Amid these events, Martin Kollie accused the government of allocating only $4,000 to MVTC while supposedly allotting $1.8 million to celebrations in the Presidents budget. In his Facebook post, Kollie maintained that this amount was included in the approved budget under the Presidents expenditures. Given his 89,000 followers, his post reached a significant audience. DUBAWA analysed the approved 2024 National Budget and the subsequent Recast Budget to verify the claim. The approved budget allocates $200,000 for celebrations under the Presidents expenses, not $1.8 million as Martin alleged. This amount is directly reflected on Page 11 of the National Budget under the Ministry of State for Presidential Affairs expenditures. The exact line item for the money is 222101 Celebrations, Commemorations, and State Visit. The Recast Budget for 2024 also contains no evidence of a $1.8 million allocation. When contacted, Martin Kollie defended his claim and advised DUBAWA to consult the budget. However, the findings did not align with his assertions. Attempts to seek clarity from Presidential Press Secretary Kula Fofana and the Information Minister were unsuccessful, as neither responded to inquiries. While it is true that MVTC faces funding challenges, the claim that $1.8 million is allocated for celebrations in the Presidents budget is inaccurate. The approved budget only earmarks $200,000 for celebrations, significantly less than the alleged amount. This discrepancy undermines Martin Kollies assertion.",1
"Claim: A viral video on WhatsApp has drawn attention of the public to a new type of sweet that is believed to kill consumers. Although 46 school children were reportedly admitted into a health facility at KwaZulu-Natal for abdominal pains allegedly linked to a sweet called XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop, none of the children died and the alleged sweet is yet to be confirmed as the cause of their illness. As such, it cannot be established that a sweet is killing people. This claim is misleading. Sweets, chocolates are cravings for almost every child. A new information spreading appears to heighten the dangers of what sweets can do to children. In a clip that has been repeatedly forwarded on WhatsApp, an unknown man was seen passionately warning mothers to restrict their little children from buying candies. Speaking in Yorb language, he said that a newly produced sweet named Killer Sweet is out. He alleged that it has been killing people and is currently the cause of stomach ache for some school children that were seen crying at a health facility which was briefly displayed in the video. The clip of the unknown claimant apparently triggered parents concerns, pushing individuals to share the video so that lives can be saved. Although the clip of the man was not found on other social media platforms aside WhatsApp, the part which shows the crying pupils has largely been redistributed to users on blogs , YouTube , Facebook , Twitter and Instagram . Apparently, the video has been used to paint different versions of narratives on the internet, all warning parents about a killer sweet that has taken lives. While some narratives say many kids have died, others say hundreds of kids were poisoned. Although unspoken, the degree at which this video is shared signals a looming fear amongst parents, a good reason to authenticate this piece of information. Multiple reports from credible media outlets reveal that a lollipop has allegedly led to stomach discomfort for 46 pupils in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa on January 31st. However, the name of the sweet is not Killer Sweet as alleged by the unknown claimant in the video but XPOP ENERGY RED DRAGON, produced by Richester Foods. Soon after the childrens illness was referenced to the Richester food, the Managing Director, Dr Hussein Cassim, in a news report by NEWS24, noted that the company is taking the utmost caution in managing the situation, and that it has launched a full internal investigation into the matter. The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health has confirmed in a press release that one of its hospitals in Ilembe District treated 46 children from a local primary school, after they had complained abdominal pains and outrightly debunked the claim that any of the children had died. The Department further disclosed that it is unable to confirm the cause of this sudden illness and that the affected children were treated and discharged the same day. Conclusions reached by the Richester food over the matter After its internal investigation, the Richester Foods, manufacturer of the lollipop, has published resolutions on its official Facebook page, emphasising that its product (the XPOP Energy) could not have been the cause of the illness. We have been selling XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop since 2017 and we have not had any complaints about this product in the past 5 years that it has been available to the public, it posted. The claimant, who only spoke in Yoruba, used the same video of the South African children in the Natal hospital who till today have not been confirmed to have fallen ill for eating the XPOP lollipop. Although 46 school children were reportedly admitted into a health facility at KwaZulu-Natal for abdominal pains, theres no credible evidence that links XPOP Energy Red Dragon lollipop to the cause of their illness. As well, the lollipop in question is not a new product. According to Richester Foods disclaimer, it has been in the market since 2017. The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health confirmed that none of the affected children has died. This claim is therefore misleading.",0
"Claim: Collapsed towers and quivering buildings were connected to the Canadian earthquake. Verdict: False. The building structures in the TikTok video are unconnected with any recent Canadian earthquake. Moreover, no credible news outlet has reported any recent earthquakes in Canada. On Tuesday, Apr. 9, 2024, a Tiktok user, disaster788 , posted a video clip showing various scenes of buildings collapsing or shaking under tremors. Along with the post, the TikTok user posted the headline Earthquake in Canada today. As of Friday, Apr. 12, 2024, the post has garnered over 330,000 likes, 9,842 comments, 31,000 bookmarks, and 118,000 shares. Other users on the platform either doubted the claims authenticity or expressed their sympathies. Is this (a) true earthquake in Canada, or a movie? Bence5369 queried. I deeply pray for Toronto, Canada. Please, Lord, keep them all safe. Strong Woman sympathised. Due to the contradictory opinions in reaction to the post, DUBAWA decided to verify the post DUBAWA conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on one of the building towers we identified as the Canadian National TowerCN tower in Toronto, Canada. We thereafter put up a keyword search on an earthquake connected with the CN tower and discovered a YouTube report published by CityNews . According to the report, published in 2022, security operatives cordoned off the perimeters of the tower and warned people to stay off its premises because the window glasses had fallen off due to a heavy wind at that time. However, there were no recent earthquake reports on the once-standing tallest building. DUBAWA also identified a fallen crane in the video clip and ran a Google Reverse Image Search. We came across an Independent news report about a similar crane with the same surroundings as the one in the clip. According to the report, the fallen crane, which had claimed the life of a worker and injured three others, had fallen into the Fort Lauderdale bridge. The workers were about to increase the cranes height when a platform from the construction site fell along parts of the crane, crashing down onto the bridge. We also discovered that one of the collapsed buildings allegedly connected to the Canadian earthquake was one of the buildings demolished by the Chinese government in 2020. This was revealed by the Chinese social media platform Meipian . According to Meipian , the building was among the properties located in an illegal construction area. It was earmarked for demolition by the Lingao Comprehensive Administrative Law Enforcement Bureau, as well as other bureaus of the state. DUBAWA also discovered that a high-rise building grid is getting submerged under demolition. The TikTok video shows 15 high-rise residential buildings in Kunming, Yunnan, China. They were demolished after seven years of remaining unfinished. This was revealed by China Media Grand Mishmash Network (CMGM). CMGM reported that the buildings were demolished because the existing units of the three plots of land could no longer meet the current market demand. Furthermore, the initial design could not comfort modern people. DUBAWA also searched for news reports and related information surrounding any recent earthquake in Canada but found none except information released by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) on Saturday, Apr. 13, 2024, that Ocean Networks Canada (ONCs) scientists are predicting an eruption. According to the news outlet, the scientists made that observation after about 200 small earthquakes per hour occurred in the area (underneath the Pacific Ocean floor far off Vancouver Island). The eruption is predicted to occur between a few weeks to a few years from now. Daily Mail , CTV News Vancouver , and Toronto Star , among others, all reported the recent development. The claim is false. The video scenes in the TikTok reel are unconnected with the alleged Canadian earthquake, and no credible news outlet reported a recent earthquake in Canada.",0
"Claim: Corrupt Nigerian politicians bury luxurious jeeps to siphon money. Verdict: The images in question had been posted online weeks earlier, with claims associating the vehicles with Afghanistan.The allegation is false, as it has no connection with Nigeria. Recently, photos of vehicles unearthed from a ditch went viral, with the assertion that corrupt Nigerian politicians hid them there. These images have been repeatedly shared on Facebook and X with slightly varying captions. For example, while a Facebook user, Masoya Sultan shared these images and sarcastically wrote I love my country with laugh emoticons, others, like TN Timkat, alleged that they were cars looted by the former governor of Zamfara state, Bello Matawelle. Another user, Abdulrasaq Yakubu, po sted a cartoon relating the discovered vehicles to the perceived corruption of some Nigerian politicians. Other places where this claim has sprouted can be found here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . DUBAWA conducted this verification due to the virality of the images. Conducting a Google Reverse Image Search, DUBAWA identified the same images were shared on X by Bella Morne, Zaid UI Khair , DefenceTimesNG , and Abdullah . They were accompanied by captions like In Mazar-i-Sharif, the Afghan government has got the treasure that was hidden underground by the previous rulers, and Look at what forces of IEA discover in Balkh Province. Simultaneously, a Reddit post alleged that the vehicles had been buried by former corrupt Afghan politicians before leaving Afghanistan. DUBAWA observed the time differences in the Nigerian and Afghanistan narratives. We traced the initial appearance of these images to Nov. 23. Meanwhile, they did not begin to make the rounds in Nigeria until Dec. 13, 2023 . However, while we were unable to verify whether the pictured vehicles were indeed found in northern Afghanistan or if they belonged to former Afghan government officials, it is noteworthy that they have no connection with Nigeria. Moreover, no reports in the Nigerian media have covered the recovery of buried vehicles. The images in question have no connection with Nigeria or its politicians. They have earlier been circulated with assertions linking the vehicles to Afghanistan. The claim is false.",0
"Claim: Nwabalis wife shows off her husband in viral photographs. Verdict: Misleading. The images were sourced from the footballers Instagram page, doctored, and shared for entertainment. After the Man of the Match title bestowed upon Stanley Nwabali, Super Eagles goalkeeper, after the semi-final victory that took Nigeria to the finals in the recently concluded African Cup of Nations (AFCON), female fans took to social media to sing praises of this footballer. As events unfolded, three images of Mr Nwabali posing with an unidentified woman described as his wife circulated across Facebook. Initially shared by Amanda Chisom Page, a Facebook blog with the caption Goodnight from first and only wife, Mrs Chisom Okolo-Nwabal. Many people have since reposted with different captions like Stanley Nwabalis wife shows off her husband. Keep off and Chisom, wife of Super Eagles goalie marking her territory as she shows off husband. With the virality of these images came contrasting arguments among users. While a few expressed doubts over the authenticity of the photographs , many accepted them as genuine. The personality involved and the controversial nature of the claim warranted this verification from DUBAWA. At first glance, one would readily accept that the footballer took those pictures with the lady. However, after a careful look, one could not help but notice Mr Nwaballis body language, which failed to acknowledge the presence of someone standing right by his side. Moreover, the three pictures lacked the typical synergy expected of a couple. Apart from maintaining a straight face with hands in his pocket, these two individuals, despite being close, had no single physical touch across the images. We checked Mr Nwabalis Instagram handle, hoping to find where he had posted a picture of himself and this alleged first lady. While at this, we found the original version of these photographs, taken solo. He posted the first image , where he held a backpack and a travel bag, on the 2nd of Jan., 2023. That was over a year ago. Similarly, he posted the second one on Jan. 1, 2024. With his two hands placed over each other at his front, he wrote, Happy New Year 2024. Likewise, Mr Nwabali posted the third image beside a white car on July 1, 2023. Checking through previous posts, we discovered that Amanda Chisoms blog had several other photographs of the goalkeeper where he allegedly posed with different women as captured here , here , here , and here . The instances either confessed their admiration or suggestively referred to him as their lover. Born to a Christian family in Port Harcourt, Nwabili started his football career at Go Round FC as a striker, from where he moved to Enyimba, Lobi Stars, Katsina United, and Chippa, for which he currently plays. No online source from him or other sources has disclosed his marital status. Our findings showed that the footballers old pictures were manipulated and shared for fun. The claim is misleading.",0
"CLAIM: A video circulating on social media showed the moment President Muhammadu Buhari voted for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. FINDING: President Muhammadu Buhari voted earlier today at Daura, Katsina state, showing off his ballot papers. Screenshots from the video obtained by the NFC showed that the president voted for the All Progressives Congress candidate. The clearer versions of the pictures were also found here and here .

"Claim: Various news reports claim that a first-class Business Administration graduate of the University of Ibadan was beaten to death for stealing bread in Bayelsa State. Verdict: MISLEADING. Our findings show that the deceased, Opuofoni Ebimotimi, is not a graduate of the University of Ibadan. In the early hours of July 11, 2023, news broke that a first-class Business Administration graduate of the University of Ibadan, Opuofoni Ebimotimi, was beaten to death by a mob in Bayelsa State for allegedly stealing bread. The narrative has gone viral and shared here , and here . Several blogs and conventional media platforms, including Sahara Reporters and Oyo Affairs , also reported the news. The virality of the claim and the reactions of students of the University of Ibadan prompted us to investigate the matter. To verify, DUBAWAs reporter visited the University of Ibadan website to view the institutions offered courses . The check revealed that the University of Ibadan does not offer Business Administration as claimed by the report. The only management course offered at the University at the undergraduate level is Economics. Before 2020, it was a department under the Faculty of Social Sciences, but this changed after the National Universities Commission (NUC) granted the request of the University to establish a faculty of Economics and Management Sciences. The new faculty is to run the following degree programs: Economics, Accounting, Banking and Finance, and Marketing, but at the moment, Economics is the only ongoing degree program in the faculty. This raised our suspicions, so we researched to verify if the victim graduated from any department at the University of Ibadan. His Facebook profile revealed that the deceased, contrary to the viral report, graduated from Lead City University (LCU), a private university in Ibadan. It also shows that he was admitted in 2012 and graduated in 2016. We also went through his network on Facebook and messaged a friend, Gbeinbo Don-living, and a sibling of the deceased, Opofuoni Freeborn Idisemi. While the sibling did not respond, Gbeinbo Don-living responded. He explained that they both graduated from Lead City University, not the University of Ibadan, as several reports claimed. He graduated from Lead City University. [We are from the] same community and graduated together. Most reporters are publishing wrong information, Mr Don-living told us. A keyword search on the incident led to a news report by Leadership Newspaper , confirming the incident happened and the Bayelsa State Police Force has commenced an investigation on the matter. Our findings show that the deceased, Opuofoni Ebimotimi, graduated from Lead City University, not the University of Ibadan. The viral report is, therefore, misleading.",0
"Claim: WASH Commission head says Weahs administration reduced Open Defecation from 42% in 2018 to 38%. Verdict: Misleading. A scrutiny of the WHO data provided by Mr Bobby Whitefield shows that while it is true that Open Defecation reduced to 37.7% (38%) in 2020 under Weah, it was not 42% in 2018 when Weah came to power. It was 38.8% (39%). The Water and Sanitation Hygiene Commission styled as the WASH Commission, is a state-owned institution. The commission is tasked as the principal government agency to regulate and promote Sanitation and Hygiene Services in Liberia. Open defecation ( OD) refers to the percentage of the population defecating in the open, such as in fields, forests, bushes, open bodies of water, on beaches and other open spaces. In Liberia, poor sanitation, notably Open Defecation, is among issues that are not given much coverage, although it remains a critical issue in the country. It is also an explicit focus of SDG 6.2. Given the issue of Open Defecation, it is important to hear President Weah talk to the nation about the subject and the efforts government is making to improve sanitation. The Presidents assurances will be hinged on information provided by the only Water and Sanitation & Hygiene Commission in Liberia headed by Mr Bobby Whitefield. Recently, Whitefield told the state broadcaster, ELBC , that President George Weah will have so much to mention about the commission when he delivers his annual message to the nation on January 30. In an interview with State Radio , Whitefield stated that the President will be able to indicate to Liberians in his annual message that under his leadership, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%. He added: Under the leadership of President Weah, the country has cut down the open defecation rate from 42% to 38%. The Weah-led administration took office in 2018 and is currently still in power; Whitefields statement suggests that the reduction occurred between 2018 and 2023. He maintained that the latest statistic is huge progress, adding, it is expected to add colours to the Liberian leaders State of the Nation address. The WASH Boss made the statement on Thursday, January 12, 2023, on the Super Morning Show , a live radio program on the Liberia Broadcasting System. He can be heard during the 37 mins of the program, which lasted for 54:04 sec. The particular statement followed a question, if the President was to mention WASH Commission in his annual message, what would be the compelling storyline? asked the host. DUBAWA reached out to Bobby Whitefield on WhatsApp to clarify his statement about the reduction in open defecation. He referred to the latest Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) Report as his source. This is the latest Joint Monitoring Program report (JMP) report conducted by WHO and UNICEF and measures access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Given the urgent need for better sanitation and a further reduction of open defecation in Liberia, DUBAWA decided to explore the matter and assess the data available from statutory institutions and international organizations. Using the document given us by Whitfield, we were able to extract information that partly confirms his statement. The latest WHO/UNICEF 2020 Joint Monitoring Program Report was published in 2020 and updated in 2021. Image: Screenshot of data summary (OD highlighted in the blue box). According to the report, Open defecation (OD) reached 37.7%, approximately 38%, as stated by Whitefield. However, the same report suggests that in 2018 OD was 38.8, not 42 as he claimed. We consulted other credible sources to compare the data available on OD in Liberia. According to data from the World Bank, open defecation was at 39% in 2018 and has fallen steadily up to 2020. The Banks data for people practising open defecation in Liberia covers the year 2000 to 2020. Also, Wateraid Liberia , on Jan 23, 2023, posted on its official Twitter page that 38% of the people in Liberia practice open defecation, and this results in sanitation-related diseases. Apart from these Facebook and Twitter posts from Wateraid, there is no latest report or data beyond 2020 on Liberia for open defecation that can be accessed to authenticate Whitefields assertion. President George Weah ascended to the Liberian Presidency on January 22, 2018, following an overwhelming victory in the 2017 Presidential and Legislative Elections in Liberia, which marks the first major transition in post-war Liberia. Open defecation in Liberia, as of 2018, was at 38.8%, with a total population of 1,868,885. By 2020, the Liberian population had increased to 1,905,886, and the OD rate had gone down to 37.7%, according to the JMP report 2020. A scrutiny of the data provided by Bobby Whitfield shows that while it is true OD may have reduced to 37% in 2020 during Mr Weahs presidency, it was not 42% in 2018, as he stated. Rather it was 38.8%. It is expected that government and its development partners will work hand-in-hand to reduce open defecation if it cannot stop it completely.

"Claim: A social media post asserted that the Nigerian Vice President, Kashim Shettima, recently addressed restructuring. Verdict: Misleading! Findings show that the video has been online since 2017, when Kashim Shettima was the Governor of Borno State. With Nigeria practising federalism for more than four decades, the subject of restructuring has long been controversial within the country. Advocates of the concept, which refers to the redistribution of authority and duties between the Federal and State governments, argue that it would limit the excessive power and funding accrued to the central government under the federal system of government. In light of the foregoing, an X user, @Uptownoflagos posted a video of Kashim Shettima, the vice president of Nigeria, addressing the contentious issue. In the 12-minute footage, Shettima could be heard allegedly scorning the idea of restructuring. Fortunately and unfortunately, the topic and issue in Nigeria is restructuring. Restructuring my foot, to hell with restructuring, the Vice President allegedly blurted out. As of Saturday, June 8, 2024, the post had amassed over 4,000 views, 1,277 likes, 835 reposts, 476 bookmarks, and 192 quotes. In the comment section, some users expressed dissatisfaction with the vice presidents opinion, while a few questioned the claims authenticity. Northern Nigeria (has) single-handedly destroyed the progress of this nation, @IGBOKWENNAMDIA1 , a user on the application, commented. @BigCrude wrote, What else does a Fulani man understand apart from one Nigeria? Another user, @___Kuizin queried, Is this an old or new video? I want to know Restructuring is happening, @Aayanfemi wrote in support of the claim. Given the sensitivity and widespread engagement surrounding the claim, DUBAWA opted to ascertain the videos recency. Using screen grabs from the video to do a Google reverse image search, DUBAWA found that the original video was uploaded on YouTube on Dec. 2, 2017. Mr Shettima was attending the book launch of the former Minister of Sports, Bolaji Abdullahi. At the launch, Mr Shettima, Chairman of the occasion, shared his thoughts about the book On a Platter of Gold-How Jonathan Won and Lost Nigeria. He reflected on how former president Goodluck Jonathan had risen to political stardom and afterwards suddenly lost the citizens vote of confidence in 2015. But in the 16 minutes and 42 seconds of the video clip, the former governor rebuffed the idea of restructuring. Instead, he suggested that Nigeria, like other Western countries, should prioritise infrastructure and social development over restructuring. Furthermore, DUBAWA conducted an advanced keyword search and found a 2017 Premium Times report in which Shettima said, To hell with restructuring when he was the Borno State Governor. Indeed, Shettima downplayed the clamour for restructuring in Nigeria, saying it is a madness that can be stopped by good governance. Further research shows that credible media outlets reported the event here and here as it occurred in 2017 and in a video that surfaced online in 2022 . Finally, we reviewed Vice President Shettima s recent posts on X to confirm the assertion and found no statement or post validating the claim. Our research shows that the video posted by the X user is an old video that has been online since 2017. Moreover, there is no available evidence that Vice President Shettima made any recent comments about Nigerias restructuring agenda.",0
"False, distorted or misinterpreted health information is dangerous to public health because this information influences health decisions and attitudes towards health interventions. While this is more common during disease outbreaks, health misinformation thrives in and out of season throughout the year because people seek helpful medical information daily. Below are some ridiculous health claims that trended in 2023 and were verified by DUBAWA. A Twitter (X) user earlier in the year asserted that masturbation causes baldness (a state of hair loss or absence of hair). This X user claimed that not everyone is bald due to nature; some are a result of masturbation. How an act of erotic stimulation could be linked to the hair growth cycle stirred curiosity. Thanks to medical articles and experts, we showed no relationship between the two . To read about hair loss and its possible causes, click here . Alcoholic drinks, from the exquisite taste of fine wine to the refreshing fizz of beer, have been enjoyed by many globally. So you can imagine how many people would be stunned by the assertion that alcohol causes the penis to shrink. Different scientific research on the Prevalence of Sexual Dysfunction in Male Subjects with Alcohol Dependence concluded that alcohol consumption could have adverse effects on sexual function. Still, the shrinkage of the penis was not identified as one of the sexual dysfunctions. In April 2023, a viral video on Facebook claimed that the apples imported into the country were painted green and red with chemicals. This video was alarming as it came amid concerns about the safety of the food Nigerians consume. An article l by Medical News Today revealed that the Apple fruit comes in varieties such as McIntosh (a juicy, red apple with tender, white flesh and a tangy flavour), Red Delicious (a crisp, juicy red apple), Fuji (a yellow and red apple with firm, sweet flesh), Granny Smith (a green apple with crisp, greenish flesh and a sharp flavour), and Golden Delicious (a yellow apple with a mild, sweet flavour). Studying the footage and the context in which it was shared in 2021, we identified that they were not real Apples but Apple-shaped items, gifts commonly presented by the Chinese to their friends and loved ones on Christmas or Valentines Day. A stroke , sometimes called a brain attack, is a medical condition that occurs when something blocks the blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, leading to brain damage or the death of the brain. A Facebook user in Oct. alleged that strokes are more common in the bathrooms because of a bath sequence which involves soaking the head and hair first. We found no evidence showing that bathing in any sequence causes a stroke. The risk factors of stroke highlighted by doctors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and obesity. Cassava is a highly consumed food in Nigeria. Globally, the country is recognised as the highest exporter of the produce and accounts for one-third of cassava production in Africa. However, a Facebook user asserts that consuming too much cassava can be deadly. Experts reveal that the health risk of consuming cassava is if it is raw, not in excess. This is linked to the presence of naturally occurring forms of cyanide within the crop that can trigger poisoning if ingested. This occurs if the cassava is not adequately prepared. So, although cassava processing methods, such as peeling, chopping and cooking, can reduce its nutritional value, it is still advised that the culture of cooking the root crop before consumption be upheld.",1
"Claim: A news media institution claimed that Matenokay Tingban had been declared a candidate in an ensuing Nimba by-election Verdict: Misleading! NEC says it has not declared any candidates for the Nimba elections. The county of Nimba, in Liberia, is set to go to a senatorial bye-election on April 22 this year. This follows the death of Senator Prince Johnson, who many regarded as the political god-father of the county. As defined by Liberias election authority, the National Elections Commission (NEC), a by-election is any election called to fill vacancies created by an unexpired term in an elective position other than the president and vice president. In the wake of activities leading to election day, a news media institution, Hott FM, published on Facebook that a former Nimba lawmaker, Matenokay Tingban, had been declared a candidate in an ensuing election. DUBAWA verified the news as part of efforts to promote truth during elections. Verification DUBAWA read through the by-election key dates as published by the NEC. Picture of the key dates from the NEC. The candidate nomination period began on March 3 and ended on March 14, 2025. The provisional list of candidates was made public on March 17, 2025. The election commission sets March 31, 2025, as the date for the publication of the final list of candidates. DUBAWA also contacted the NEC through its Communications Director, Prince Dunbar , to verify the information coming from Hott FM further. Dunbar said the NEC has not declared any candidates for the upcoming election. We have no candidates, he said. NEC has not declared anybody as a candidate yet. He said publishing the provisional list does not mean a person is a candidate in the election. The provisional list means that we have received the documents of some people, and we are scrutinising the documents, Dunbar said. On the 31st of March, the final list of candidates will be published. Hott FMs post that Matenokay Tingban has been declared a candidate in the Nimba by-election is misleading.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user shared images stating that it depicts the ongoing Lagos-Calabar road project. Verdict: DUBAWA traced one of the images to a road in the United States and confirmed others to be genuinely from the Lagos-Calabar road construction. The claim is partially true. Years after the idea was proposed, the Federal Government of Nigeria recently launched the construction of the first phase of the Lagos-Calabar 700km highway. Starting from Ahmadu Bello Way in Lagos, the project, estimated to cost N15 trillion and N4 billion per kilometer, will go through nine coastal routes including the Lekki Deep Seaport, Ogun, Ondo, Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers and Akwa Ibom. Days after the project commenced, Olusegun Adeniyi , a Facebook user shared three images depicting the status of the road. This is the ongoing 700km Lagos-Calabar Coastal Highway project, Nigeria, his caption partly read. It is a Trunk A road #project designed to be five-lane in some places with railway line provision. It is being done with Rigid Pavement Technology (Cement Technology) with iron mast reinforcement. When completed, it will have at least 40 years lifespan. Nigeria is rebuilding infrastructure to trigger new economic growth. Invest in Nigeria z. Mr Adeniyis post has generated 377 likes and 116 comments. While many users praised the federal government in the comment section, Success Emhabino, another Facebook user, not only questioned the authenticity of these images but also the existence of the entire project. She wrote, Anybody around that area should verify that project. I dont trust the Nigerian Government. There is a possibility that the shared images may contain some elements of misinformation; thus, DUBAWA decided to conduct this fact check. We grouped the images in the following order for clarity: Photo 1 The first image shows a fully constructed road already in use, with multiple lanes and a two-track railway in the middle. A closer look at the image raised two concerns. First, the Lagos-Calabar road project was only recently commissioned; it would be too early for any use. Likewise, the Minister of Works, David Umahi, has clarified that though there is a provision to build a rail system with the project, the process has not started. We then conducted a reversed image search linking the source of this photo to an American publication dated Nov. 1, 2022. According to the article, the image was taken at the Ashburn Silver Line rail network, Virginia, USA. The second and third images show ongoing road construction at an unidentified location. Workers can be seen operating an SP 94 slipform paver, which is used for concrete surfaces on the site. We searched through recent posts on Mr Umahis Facebook page. On March 29, 2024, he shared four images from a road construction site, including the second image. However, without mentioning the location, he simply wrote, Trust the process. We found a video shared by two YouTubers who physically inspected the progress of the coastal road project alongside Mr Umahi on April 9, 2024. In the footage, we spotted landmarks which matched with those in both images. A high-rise building is spotted in the third image. A high-rise building was spotted in the footage. While the first image was sourced from another project in the U.S., our findings confirmed that the last two images are indeed related to the ongoing Lagos-Calabar coastal road project. This renders the claim partly true.",0

The post also failed to mention the name of the commissioner or the ministry.",1
"Claim: An Instagram user, Dr Daryl Gioffre, claims corn contains 25 forms of aflatoxins, a cancer-causing fungus/mould. Verdict: True. The claim that corn can contain cancer-causing aflatoxins is true. This is said to occur naturally, but poor post-harvest handling increases the likelihood of contamination. Corn or maize is a popular snack among Nigerians. Whether boiled, roasted, or turned into various treats, corn is versatile and transcends socioeconomic boundaries and seasons. Its affordability and wide availability, particularly during the rainy season, make it a beloved food staple nationwide. While corn is a common snack many enjoy, most Nigerians may not give much thought to the type or quality of corn they consume. On Sept. 5, 2024, an Instagram user, Dr Daryl Gioffre, posted a video , with the caption, How old were you when you found out that corn actually contains 25 aflatoxins, which are cancer-causing fungus/moulds? As of Oct. 10, 2024, the post had garnered over 53,000 likes. Mr Gioffres claim raises concerns about the potential health risks. DUBAWA decided to investigate this because of public health safety. Verification According to the National Cancer Institute, Aflatoxins are a group of toxins produced by fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, commonly found on crops such as maize, peanuts, cottonseed, and tree nuts. According to the National Cancer Institute, these fungi thrive in warm and humid climates and can contaminate crops both in the field and during harvest and storage. Humans are exposed to aflatoxins primarily by consuming contaminated plant-based products or animal-derived products, such as meat and dairy, from livestock fed with contaminated feed. Agricultural workers may also be at risk by inhaling dust generated during the handling and processing of these crops. Long-term exposure to aflatoxins poses significant health risks. According to Biomedcentral , Aflatoxin B1 is the most dangerous of the aflatoxins, it is highly carcinogenic and has been linked to hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer. The carcinogenic effect of aflatoxins, particularly AFB1, is intensified in individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). Aflatoxins have also been associated with other types of cancer and organ damage, especially to the liver and kidneys. In addition to their carcinogenic effects, aflatoxins are mutagenic, meaning they can alter DNA, and are genotoxic, which could potentially cause birth defects, as noted by Ambiotec Solutions . They also suppress the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections like HIV or tuberculosis. Prolonged exposure can lead to immunosuppression, compromising the bodys ability to fight off diseases. Acute exposure to high levels of aflatoxins can cause aflatoxicosis, a potentially fatal condition due to severe liver damage. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that large doses of aflatoxins can lead to immediate death, while long-term exposure to smaller doses may result in immune system impairment or nutritional deficiencies. In summary, aflatoxins are potent toxins that pose severe health risks, ranging from liver cancer to immune suppression, and require careful management to minimise human exposure. A dietician, Emmanuel Oyebamiji of the University of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa, confirmed the presence of aflatoxins in corn, emphasising the health risks associated with poor post-harvest practices. Although he could not confirm the exact levels of aflatoxin in corn, Mr Oyebamiji noted that maize often contains no fewer than 20 parts per billion (ppb) of the harmful toxin. Mr Oyebamiji said the presence of aflatoxins is closely linked to poor sanitation practices during harvesting and post-harvest handling. It occurs naturally, but poor handling exacerbates the problem, Mr Oyebamiji explained. Farmers should ensure that maize is harvested at moisture levels between 20% and 30%. When properly handled and the seed is not broken, aflatoxin cannot develop. Contamination often results from wet or contaminated packaging materials. He further warned that cooking methods like roasting or boiling are insufficient to eliminate aflatoxins. Some people believe that cooking reduces aflatoxin levels, but it doesnt kill the toxin, only reduces it. Aflatoxin is a known risk factor for cancer. To prevent contamination, he recommended stringent sanitation practices for equipment and storage facilities. The first step is cleaning all harvesting, handling, and drying equipment, as well as storage bins, to remove any broken corn, dust, or foreign materials that could cause contamination. Farmers should also ensure storage bins are repaired to prevent moisture leaks and use approved insecticides to treat storage areas. A medical doctor, Omobolanle Braihmoh, highlighted the dangers of consuming food with 25 parts per billion of harmful toxins, emphasising that it poses a significant risk for diseases and fungal infections. She explained that consuming foods intended for cooking in their raw state can lead to health complications. No food meant for cooking should be consumed raw by humans. While some farmers argue that eating food raw retains more nutrients, the risk of fungal infection is high when foods meant to be cooked are consumed raw, she said. The claim that corn can contain cancer-causing aflatoxins is true. Aflatoxins, which are produced by fungi, pose serious health risks, including liver cancer, immune suppression, and even death. Poor post-harvest handling increases the likelihood of contamination, and cooking methods such as boiling or roasting do not totally eliminate the toxins.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message encourages parents to deworm their children, implying that not doing so could lead to sudden death. This message is misleading. While deworming children is essential, not doing so cannot (alone, without other factors) cause sudden death as depicted in the message. Deworming, according to Gi Doc is the process of expelling intestinal worms or parasitic worms from the body by administering an anthelmintic medicine/drug. Anthelmintic medicines/drugs are simply medications used to eliminate worms from the body. Deworming is also known as worming, drenching or dehelmintization. Worms are known as helminth parasites; they are of various types (like roundworms, tapeworms or flukes) and they affect humans (children/adults) as well as animals. Medical experts, therefore, encourage regular deworming to eliminate worms. Worms can be transmitted into the body by playing in the sand, through contact with worm infested poop, eating raw or infected food, not washing hands before eating, walking barefooted and not maintaining good hygiene. Worm infestation can affect individuals health and lead to serious complications, but can worm infestation cause sudden death? A WhatsApp message tells the story of how a Nigerian baby died at a general hospital due to worm infestation. The message then encourages residents of Oyo State in South West Nigeria to partake in the state governments deworming exercise. The second to the last paragraph in the message claims that Oyo State was having a deworming exercise on that day (the day the copied message was posted) which was July 13, 2021. Dubawa searched online. Although there was information about deworming exercises in Oyo State, they were for previous years. This implies that the WhatsApp message might have been a recycled message from previous years. To ascertain the authenticity of the medical claims in the message, Dubawa reached out to two Consultant Public Health physicians. Dr. Doyin Ogunyemi, Consultant Public Health Physician and a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Community Health and Primary Care, Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), told Dubawa that the claims are exaggerated. Deworming, Dr. Ogunyemi said, is important as it helps eliminate worms that, if left unchecked, could cause stomach pains, fatigue, weakness, bloody stool, itching anus and signs of stunting and malnutrition. In severe cases, it may lead to intestinal obstruction requiring surgery but worms on their own cannot lead to sudden death. She said what is likely to occur is death occurring from complications of severe anaemia and intestinal obstruction, and these occur over a period of time and are very unlikely to cause death as depicted in the message. Dr. Nasir Ariyibi, a Consultant Public Health Physician and the Medical Director of Lagos State University Health Centre, affirmed Dr. Ogunyemis position, noting that WhatsApp stories are usually designed to cause panic while claiming to offer advice. Dr. Ariyibi noted that the story does not add up and while doctors may note likely cause of death, they are unlikely to do so in the unprofessional manner depicted in the story. Dr. Ariyibi noted that worm infestation can also cause schistosomiasis, blood in urine and some other forms of skin infections. Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by freshwater parasitic worms that can enter the body and travel to different parts like the kidney and liver and cause great discomfort. Dr. Ariyibi is also of the opinion that worm infestation (if not treated over a long time) can lead to serious complications, and it is those serious complications (if untreated) that can lead to death, so it is not a linear process of worm infestation simply causing sudden death. However, Dr. Ariyibi encouraged Nigerians to deworm themselves and children about twice a year or at least once a year and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene to prevent worm infestation, its complications and other diseases. Regular deworming is encouraged as well as good hygiene, and worm infestation, if not treated early enough, could lead to serious complications. However, worm infection cannot simply lead to death as depicted in the WhatsApp story.",0
"By Steve Dede Claim: Nigerias Information Minister Lai Mohammed denied that he once announced a N5 million fine on hate speech in Nigeria. Contrary to Lai Mohammeds denial, he did announce the increment of fine on hate speech from N500, 000 to N5 million as evident in the available video clip. After the report that the Federal Government imposed a N5m fine on hate speech on broadcast stations in Nigeria, Lagos based radio station Nigeria Info 99.3FM was one of the first broadcast stations to be hit with the fine. This development prompted a human rights lawyer, Inibehe Efiong, to challenge the imposition of the fine in court. Mr Effiong also challenged the threat by the National Broadcasting Commission to punish other broadcast stations in the country over alleged hate speech. In a counter-affidavit in response to a motion filed by the human right lawyer, Lai Mohammed denied ever announcing the increment of the fine from N500, 000 to N5, 000,000. Paragraph 19 is denied. The 2nd defendant (Mohammed) did not announce an increment in any fine for hate speech from N500,000 to N5,000,000 or any other because there is a governmental body or institution mandated to regulate and enforce the Nigerian Broadcasting Code, Punch quoted from the affidavit. Contrary to his denial, Mr Mohammed did announce the increment of the fine. On Tuesday, August 4, 2020, Nigerias Minister of Information Lai Mohammed announced that the Federal Government had increased the fine for hate speech from N500, 000 to N5m. Although there have been earlier reports that the Federal Government was planning to increase the fine from N500, 000 to N5 million, Mr Mohammed on that day confirmed the speculation. During the unveiling of the Reviewed Broadcasting code, the Minister said a presidential directive necessitated the amendments in the wake of the 2019 general elections. While announcing the amendment of the Broadcasting Code, the minister said; Another highlight of the amendment is the provision that has raised the fine for hate speeches from half a million Naira to N5m. This will serve as a deterrent to those who want to use our broadcast stations to sow the seed of discord. A detailed search on this finds Lai Mohammeds announcement of the increase in the fine for hate speech between 10:48- 11:22 minute mark of a video on Channels TV Youtube page. A search on the subject on Google also brings several results from credible and popular media platforms like Premium Times , Punch, Naira Metrics and Pulse who reported Lai Mohammeds announcement. Lai Mohammed did announce the Federal Governments increment of the hate speech fine from N500, 000 to N5 million. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2020 Fellowship partnership with Pulse.ng to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: Fula people must go with their national ID cards in addition to their voters card on election day in order to be allowed to vote viral WhatsApp audio The Communications Director at the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) says that people only need their voters cards.

The conditions to be met to vote, as indicated on the website of the IEC include the following: No mention is made of national ID cards as a requirement. Dubawa further spoke with the Director of Communications at the IEC, Pa Makan Khan, to verify the viral information. Pa Makan Khan said the information is false. He said voters only need to show their voters identification card in order to be allowed to cast their ballot. That is fake newsjust your voters card, he said.",1

"Claim: Facebook users are circulating an image of a man wearing police camouflage with the claim that he is a Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police who was arrested with kidnappers when he went to supply them firearms. The image and content in circulation are that of a Police imposter arrested in Akwa Ibom in 2019 and therefore cannot be that of a Deputy Commissioner of Police in Kaduna. Hence, the claim is FALSE. The picture of a man wearing a police camouflage in what appeared to be a Nigerian-styled parade of criminals is being circulated by social media users with the caption that he is an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Kaduna State. According to a Facebook post by Araba Kayode , it is the image of a Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police and his accomplices after they were arrested while the alleged DCP was supplying weapons to kidnappers. Before this recent circulation, Ayonla MultiMedia had posted on April 13, 2021, the same image with the caption: Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give arms to kidnappers, unfortunately, he was arrested with them. Hmm! Wonders shall never end. The post received over 1,000 comments and was shared over 12, 000 times. Dubawa first traced the origin of the image by using Yandex Reverse Image search which revealed that the picture has been shared several times and goes as far back as 2019. The image was also traced to several counter narratives and even fact checks in the past that stated that the image of the alleged Deputy Commissioner of Police was fake. Several reports published in 2019 show that the man from the image in question was arrested in January 2019 for impersonating a police officer. Nigerian Police Spokesman, CP Frank Mba, who was then a Deputy Commissioner of Police had then said: The suspect in Police uniform with the rank of an Assistant Commissioner of Police, is one Kingsley Udoyen, male, 56 years, of No 3, Stadium Road, Abak, Akwa Ibom State is a fake Police officer and not a serving Assistant Commissioner of Police. For further clarification, Dubawa reached out to the Kaduna State Police Command which equally debunked the claim. The Commands Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, said the attention of the states command was drawn to what he described as fake news making round on social media, alleging that Kaduna State Deputy Commissioner of Police went to give firearms to kidnappers; unfortunately, he was arrested with them. ASP Jalige said the image in circulation was not that of any police officer in Kaduna Command or anywhere in Nigeria adding that: The image with camouflage uniform wearing the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police is one Kinsley Udoyem who was arrested and paraded by Akwa-Ibom Police Command on the 2nd January 2019 for the offence of impersonating a Police Officer. He urged the public to disregard the fake claim and stop its circulation. This shows that the content with the image in circulation is fake; the man in the camouflage police uniform is an impersonator that was arrested in Akwa Ibom in 2019 and not in Kaduna State. The researcher produced this fact-check per the Dubawa 2021 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with The Daily Trust to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: The Chief Spokesperson of the Obi-Datti Organisation, Yunusa Tanko, asserted that there was no single armed robbery case during Peter Obis tenure as governor of Anambra State. Verdict: False! Findings revealed robbery incidents in Anambra when Peter Obi was the state governor. Over the years, insecurity has been a significant threat to Nigerias stability and development. While banditry and terrorism continue to wreak havoc across the Northern parts of the country, other areas in the South battle with sit-at-home orders by the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) . During a conversation about the general situation in the nation, Yunusa Tanko, the official spokesperson of the Obi-Datti Organisation, claimed that Peter Obi, the Labour Party presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections, did not record any case of armed robbery when he was the Governor of Anambra State. There was no single armed robbery in Anambra State when Peter Obi was the governor [of the state], he stated between 43rd and 54th seconds of the video. Mr Tanko said this in a heated argument with Kassim Afegbua, a chieftain and 2024 governorship aspirant of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Edo State. Mr Tanko and Mr Afegbua were guests on Mic on Podcast , a political programme held every Saturday to discuss political issues hosted by Seun Okinbaloye , a broadcast journalist with Channels Television. As of this report, the interactive show has been viewed by 14,000 users and has about 150 likes on YouTube, where it was originally live-streamed on June 1, 2024. DUBAWAs investigation shows that the video has been featured on other platforms, including here and here . The sensitive nature of the claim prompted DUBAWA to investigate its veracity. DUBAWA conducted a keyword search on the security situation in Anambra State and found a Daily Trust report published in 2015. It analysed the number of reported cases of armed robbery in Nigeria, showing that Lagos, Anambra, and Abia States were the top robbery spots in Nigeria between 2007 and 2011. It is noteworthy that Mr Obi served twice as the governor of Anambra State, from 2006 to 2010, and was re-elected for a second term that ended in 2014. Lagos recorded the highest number of cases within the period, totalling 742, while Anambra and Abia trailed behind Lagos with 549 and 544 cases, respectively. According to the Daily Trust report, the reported armed robbery cases in these three states were more than the total number recorded in the six North-central or Northeast states. Further research through the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) shows that 549 armed robbery cases were recorded in Anambra State during Mr Obis tenure as governor. After carefully examining the document, a breakdown of the reported robbery incidents shows 96 confirmed cases in 2007, 69 in 2008, 240 in 2009, 94 in 2010, and 50 in 2011. In summary, 549 armed robbery cases are the total number recorded from Anambra State during Mr Obis tenure. See Table 192 on Page 197. Additionally, various credible media outlets published different robbery reports in Anambra State during Peter Obis governorship here , here , and here . Mr Tankos assertion that Anambra did not have a record of armed robbery during Peter Obis tenure as governor is false. Findings show there were 549 cases of armed robbery attacks between 2007 and 2011 alone.",0
"Claim : Two viral images show a Yoruba cleric allegedly arrested for possessing human body parts. Verdict : Misleading. While the first image used is outdated and unrelated to the current claim, the second image is relevant but refers to an incident that occurred six months ago. Ethnic divisions are a global issue that can quickly deteriorate if not addressed promptly. In recent weeks, DUBAWA has observed a trend of exchanges between Igbo and Yoruba social media users. Both groups have been involved in sharing images and videos with either false or misleading narratives. A prominent theme in these exchanges is the use of derogatory terms such as Igbo-human-eaters, Yorubanivorous, and Yoruba ritualists to describe each other. One example is a post by @chiditweets042, an X user who claimed that the Ondo police arrested a cleric named Oluwafemi Idris for possessing human body parts. The post included two images: the first showing a man and woman opening a bucket with unclear contents, and the second showing two human hands and other indistinct items in three bowls. This post has spread beyond X and has been reposted on Facebook as seen here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , and here . While such claims may not be unusual, the disinformation fueled by ethnic bias and hatred is concerning, so DUBAWA conducted this fact-check to set the record straight. A reverse image search on the first image revealed it has been online since Feb. 2022. Reports from The Nation and Ripples Nigeria confirm that the individuals in the image, Kehinde Oladimeji, 43, and Adejumoke Raji, 35, were arrested at their Abeokuta residence in Ogun State after being found in possession of human parts. A reverse image search on the second image led to a more recent incident in Ondo State, dated March 31, 2024. The human hands seen in the bowl were recovered from an Islamic cleric, Oluwafemi Idris. Along with the hands, authorities reportedly found three hearts, three kidneys, a tongue, and a spine in his apartment. Details of this event are available in these reports here and here . While the first image is outdated and unrelated to the current claim, the second image is relevant but refers to an incident that happened six months ago.",1
"Claim : Togar Alexander Bealded , a controversial Liberian social media user, alleged on Facebook that the Pro tempore of the Liberian Senate Nyonblee Karnga-Lwarence has imported a 2025 Hyundai Staria at over $100k. Verdict : Misleading! DUBAWAs investigation shows that while it is true that she bought the said vehicle, findings from Africa Motors reveal that it cost USD$45K before duty and USD$51K with Duty paid. Budget overspending by public officials in Liberia is a primary concern, especially when the country has to contend daily with many challenges, including poor healthcare, inadequate school facilities, and bad road conditions. With the Legislature being the branch of government responsible for making laws and exercising oversight on the executive and other public agencies, the populace pays keen attention to their work. These lawmakers majorly have to represent the interests of their various constituents properly. Another issue of concern is corruption, which is strongly considered an enemy of the RESCUE government. Rescue is a jargon crafted and used by the government since its campaign period for 2023. The name came about when the Unity Party then opposition labelled the former President George Weahs Administration as a failed government, claiming itself (Unity Party) as the messiah that had come to rescue the suffering population. Former Commerce Minister Amin Modad was pressured to resign in October 2024 after he purchased a vehicle costing USD$96k during his few months in office as Minister of Commerce. However, on January 21, 2025, a Facebook user, Togar Alexander Bealded, alleged that the Senate Pro Tempore had purchased a vehicle costing more than USD$100k. Bealded claimed that the vehicles model is the Hyundai Staria 2025. He stressed that in a country like Liberia, where children still struggle to acquire quality education and inadequate healthcare, the Protem officer has wasted taxpayers money. ProTem brings in the Hyundai Staria 2025 model, which is over USD 100K, probably electric in a poor Liberia. Imagine her county has no electricity and public schools and lacks chalks, teachers, and innovation. The only college in the county has no bridge to get there and no bus to transport students. Women and fathers have no jobs to send their kids to school, and overall, Liberia is a disaster, but here you are riding such a vehicle above the threshold of what the government says officials should use. Amin Modad was pressured to resign for getting a car beyond the same threshold, but again, the Pro tem aint care. Aye, mehn, why do these folks treat the country and our people like this? Equipped with futuristic, he wrote. The post sparked mixed reactions on Facebook and has become a public discussion point. The claim generated 77 reactions, 177 comments, and 51 shares. Some users aligned with the claimant, while others defaulted on the allegation. The mixed reactions amongst the public led DUBAWA to initiate a fact-check. DUBAWA first reached out to find out the model of the vehicle and its price. The Communication Officer in the offices of Protem Lawrence, Henry Karmo, confirmed to the researcher that the car is a Hyundai Staria 3.5L 2025 model, adding that the vehicle cost USD45k, but the Pro tempore negotiated the price down to USD$43k. According to Henry Karmo, Africa Motor lent the vehicle to Senator Lawrence on an installmental basis since the government didnt provide her with an official car since she came into office. The car was borrowed from Africa Motors for a cost of USD$43k. The agreement was that she would pay in instalments. The government is yet to provide her official vehicle, Karmo said. In further verification, DUBAWA visited the Africa Motors office on 18th Street Monrovia to inquire about the price of the Hyundai Staria 3.5L 2025 model. The prices start at USD$45K for a duty-free Hyundai Staria 3.5L and USD$51k with duty. Image of the prices below A duty-free vehicle can be imported without paying customs duties or other taxes, and a duty-paid vehicle requires payment of customs duties or import tax upon entry into the country. DUBAWA again checked on the Hyundai website and found the cost of a similar vehicle selling between $53,890-$73,604 According to DUBAWAs findings, the Pro Tempore officer purchased a new vehicle, but not at a cost of USD100k. Checks indicate that the vehicle costs between USD$45k and USD$51k.",1
"Claim: No country in the world has birthright citizenship, an Instagram user asserts. Verdict: False. Findings show Mexico and many other countries around the world have birthright citizenship. Following his January 20 inauguration as the 47th President of the United States of America, Donald Trump issued many executive orders. One of them is seeking to overturn birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship, also called jus soli, is a governmental policy under which any child born within a countrys borders or territory is automatically granted citizenship in that countryeven if their parents are not citizens. Like others, this order has been met without sharp criticism from Americans and non-Americans. Just a day after the Presidents order, the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that 18 states in the U.S. sued the Trump administration over the executive order seeking to overturn citizenship by birth. Reacting to the news agencys Instagram publication, Raymond020954 , an Instagram user urged people to stop the criticism because no country in the world has birthright citizenship. A screenshot of Raymonds comment. The CBS publication received 8,578k reactions and 772 comments, while Raymonds comment received 108 reactions as of this report. Given the different reactions that Raymonds comment sparked, DUBAWA verified the truthfulness of the claim. DUBAWA searched The World Facts-book, a U.S. government publication, and found that Brazil, Cuba, The Gambia, Jamaica, Mexico, Mauritius, and Pakistan are countries with birthright citizenship, apart from the United States of America. For example, h ere and here list countries that have birthright citizenship. The Instagram users claim that no country has birthright citizenship is false.",1
"Claim: X user shared a picture of a royal family in Uba-Agwa in Oguta Local Government Area, arrested for robbery and kidnapping. Verdict: Misleading! Multiple news platforms reported the original incident in August 2020, using the same photograph in the recent post. Tribalism remains a deeply rooted issue in Nigeria, influencing social interactions, political decisions, and resource access. With over 250 ethnic groups, the countrys rich diversity, which is a source of cultural pride, has also given rise to prejudices and stereotypes, which continue to stoke divisions and tension. An X user, Pst Okezie (@Onsugbo), shared a picture of the arrest of an Igbo monarch from Uba-Agwa in Oguta LGA, along with his wife, cousin, pastor, and 30 others on charges of robbery and kidnapping. The picture shared shows the monarch sitting on the floor alongside other people during a parade by the police. The picture, posted on Oct. 14, 2024, has attracted significant attention, amassing 52,200 views. It has also sparked considerable engagement, with 129 comments, 207 reposts, 412 likes, and 40 bookmarks. The post can also be found on Facebook here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here . Given the posts virality, public interest, and the involvement of notable personalities, DUBAWA decided to verify. A keyword search revealed that the news dates back to 2020. An article by PM NewsNigeria dated Aug. 3, 2020, with the same picture, had the headline Imo chief Eze Okuegbunuwa, dad & two sons arrested for kidnapping. The news report noted that the monarchs gang had kidnapped Louis Obodo at Mgbala Agwa in Oguta LGA on Jul. 19, 2020, after the police gave them a hot chase. The 59-year-old ruler of Obor Community was paraded along with 30 other suspects who allegedly committed various crimes ranging from robbery, kidnapping and rape. We found other reports of the same development with the same date in The Nation , The Street Journal, and The View Point . TinEye , a widely used image verification tool known for tracking the origins and circulation of images across the Internet, indicates that the photograph in question first appeared online in 2020. This discovery establishes that the post is not new but recirculated recently to mislead the public. The claim about the arrest of an Igbo monarch with his family and others for robbery and kidnapping is misleading. Our investigation confirms that the image and accompanying story are not recent but date back to 2020.",0
"Claim: Nigerias Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, recently claimed that the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo spent between 300 million and 400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, and alleged that the equipment purchased is nowhere to be found. There is insufficient data to validate this claim by the Minister. On Thursday the 10th of June 2021, Nigeria officially launched the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure, also known as the Deep Blue Project. The project displays some of the $195 million of equipment with the primary objective of securing Nigerian waters along the Gulf of Guinea and the countrys oil infrastructure with a coordinated combination of land, sea, and air forces. According to a statement by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, Nigerias Maritime Security Unit (MSU) of the Deep Blue Project, comprised personnel from the Nigerian Navy, Nigerian Army, Nigerian Air Force, Nigeria Police, and Department of State Services, and their goal was to demonstrate their preparedness for full deployment to fight the ongoing menace of piracy, mostly emerging from the Nigerias Niger Delta region. It was during the official inauguration of the Integrated National Security and Waterways Protection Infrastructure in Nigeria (also called the Deep Blue Project) at the ENL Terminal, Apapa Port, Lagos, the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, alleged that President Olusegun Obasanjo administration spent between 300 million and 400 million on equipment for fighting insecurity in the maritime sector, but that the equipment so allegedly purchased disappeared. He said: This war, under President Obasanjo; they spent between 300 million and 400 million to buy the same equipment we have bought and they have disappeared. The Deep Blue Project (DBP) was first initiated in 2017 by the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi. One of the first steps involved the Nigerian Government approving a maritime security contract with Israeli firm HLSI Security Systems and Technologies Limited for asset procurement and leasing. In 2020, Amaechi requested further funds to hire fast intercept vessels for one year, claiming the $195 million already approved for the same purpose had been put on hold due to COVID-19. In total, Nigeria has allocated a tenth of its defence budget to the DBP and is expected to deploy an increased range of assets to tackle maritime insecurity including two Special Mission Vessels, seventeen Fast Interceptor Boats, two Special Mission Aircraft, three helicopters, four unmanned aerial vehicles and sixteen armoured vehicles. Furthermore, to bolster intelligence gathering and sharing efforts, a command, control, computer communication and information centre (C4i) has also been set up in Kirikiri, Lagos. In a March 29 2021 article, Swim together or sink alone: African states unite to confront pirate threat writer Shola Lawal reported that Nigerias Deep Blue Project (DBP), launched this year, is cautiously inspiring hope. The ambitious $195 million project aims to purchase assets like fast-intervention vessels, build interagency command centers for the countrys naval and port authorities, and train security forces. Chijioke Alozie reports in his seminal paper, Exploring Contemporary Sea Piracy in Nigeria, the Niger Delta and the Gulf of Guinea that the first serious effort in this area by any administration in Nigeria was when then President Yar Adua (2007-2010) appointed a Federal Minister of Niger Delta region to provide oversight into projects and peoples complaints, and above all, to be the Federal Governments presence in the region. Successive governments have followed the historic pace set by YarAdua, by the appointment of a Federal Minister of Niger Delta. There is no record of purchase of any security hardware but efforts were essentially directed at pacifying the militants at the time. But in an attempt to fight maritime piracy, the government, in August 2014, appointed a one-time Niger-Delta warlord from Bayelsa State, General Boyloaf, as leader of a maritime security outfit in his home state of Bayelsa. It is worth remembering that Boyloaf once led an aggressive attack on a Shell oil platform 120 km (74 miles) offshore. In 2014 Boyloaf was quoted to have said, the government was having serious security challenges in the creeks. They chose me to deal with it as the creeks are my terrain. I was born in the creeks, I fought against the government in the creeks, and I will now use that knowledge to hunt the pirates. In all our investigation into the claim made by Mr Rotimi Amaechi, the Transportation Minister, there was no available record or document to indicate that the Obasanjo administration purchased security or military equipment to combat piracy on the Gulf of Guinea other than the October 2005 setting up of a Naval Base in Bonny. In all our findings, there was no budgetary allocation for the specific purpose of purchasing equipment, let alone a mention of spending of between 300 million and 400. Attempts were made to get Mr Amaechi to substantiate his claim with evidence. Text message sent to his phone number was not replied and repeated calls to the line were not answered. This writer also sent an email to the minister but got no response. There is no sufficient record to back the claim by Minister Rotimi Amaechi that the Obasanjo administration spent between 300 million and 400 million to buy equipment for safeguarding the maritime sector. The researcher produced this fact-check per Splash FM 105.5, Ibadan , with the Dubawa 2021 Fellowship partnership, to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user shared a photo claiming that a Catholic priest recently had a wedding against religious doctrine in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State. Verdict: False. Our findings reveal that the photo used to substantiate the claim is linked to Kenya, where a Catholic priest married after leaving the Roman Catholic Church for the Catholic Charismatic church. Moreover, no available evidence accounts for such a recent development in Nigeria. Over the years, different controversies have surrounded clerical celibacy worldwide. Clerical celibacy is a discipline of the Catholic faith by which only unmarried men are ordained to the priesthood. The proponents of this sacred doctrine describe it as a special gift of God that enables sacred ministers to more readily dedicate themselves to the service of God and their neighbours and to remain close to Christ with an undivided heart. However, not all ministers embrace this doctrine. Amidst this divide, a Facebook user identified as Okoronko Ejike posted a photo asserting that a Catholic priest has just wedded a woman publicly in Abakali, Ebonyi State capital, after having prolonged years of relationship. He added that the Reverend Father, popularly called a Catholic priest, acted properly by refusing to live a life of deception. He wrote: This is Reverend Father Jude Obasi, who hails from Afikpo North local government area of Ebonyi State, Nigeria, who got wedded publicly to his long-time lover of over (six) years just this last Saturday at St Marys Catholic Church, Abakaliki. In an interview, Father Jude stated that he refused to live a life of lies and deception that other Reverend fathers are secretly living. Do you know that a lot of these children of the majority of most single mums were fathered by these pretentious priests that hitherto have sworn an oath of celibacy(?) How do you mount a pulpit and condemn adultery and fornication, kidnapping, prostitution, banditry, and yahoo yahoo when you are neck deep in it? If you cannot hold your body as a priest serving in the Lords Vineyard, please choose from amongst your church members and get married. Its more honourable and biblical as a reverend father to marry your church member{s}. Over 1,000 accounts have reacted to the post, garnering over 1,000 shares and 420 likes as of May 26, 2024. The comment section was inundated with different views, some suggesting the photo was real while others raised questions. A Facebook user, Adolphus Godstime , queried: Im not a Catholic, but I dont believe this story if it is true Another Facebook user, Lawson Tagbo , said: God will bless and protect your marriage. Judging by a mans biological nature, no man, including priests, should be forced to live their lives without a woman. Period! said Keep On , another commenter. DUBAWA checks show that the claim has been posted by different users with the same narrative. See here and here . The sensitivity of the claim and the mixed reactions trailing it led DUBAWA to conduct a fact check. DUBAWA conducted several keywords to check if a Nigerian priest named Jude Obasi had recently married in Ebonyi State but found none. A reverse image search showed that the photo of the protesting bishop first surfaced on the internet on October 23, 2023, contrary to the claim that it was a recent photo. It was taken during a wedding ceremony between Reverend Father Edwin Gathangi Waiguru, an ordained Catholic priest, and Margaret Wanjira Githui in Ikinu village, Githunguri, Kiambu County of Kenya. Father Waiguru decided after leaving the Roman Catholic Church to join the Catholic Charismatic Church, a Roman Catholic splinter group. The key distinction between the two religious groups lies in the sacrament of marriage, as priests from the Charismatic Church are allowed to marry. Our findings were corroborated by media reports from Pulse Kenya and several other outlets here and here . Further research was done on the Catholic Church of Abakalikis official website , but no post was linked to the claim. We called the websites phone numbers to inquire about the post but received no response. The claim is false. DUBAWAs research discovered that the picture used to depict the alleged marriage was posted in 2023 and linked with Kenya. Moreover, no report is available detailing the marriage ceremony of a Nigerian Catholic priest in Ebonyi State.",0
"Claim: The Gleaner newspaper has alleged on Facebook that Sierra Leones Ambassador to Guinea is under house arrest following the arrest of his driver found with over 380 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000 in the Ambassadors vehicle. Verdict: According to Timothy Kabba, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the claim is false and lacks evidence. On January 13, 2025, the government of Guinea informed Sierra Leone that a vehicle belonging to its Embassy in Conakry had been impounded. The driver and another individual were arrested on suspicion of possessing substances believed to be cocaine. This incident has sparked controversy both in Sierra Leone and Guinea. However, on January 18, 2025, the Gleaner newspaper posted on Facebook that the Sierra Leone Ambassador was under house arrest in Guinea after his driver was caught with 380 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000 in the vehicle. The post stated, Sierra Leones Ambassador to Guinea Under House Arrest Amid Cocaine Scandal. Alimamy Hassan Bangura, Sierra Leones Ambassador to Guinea, has been placed under house arrest following the arrest of his driver, who was discovered with over 380 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000 in cash in the Ambassadors utility vehicle. According to sources, the cocaine may have been linked to a businessman named Alhaji Bah, as well as several high-ranking officials in Sierra Leones government and the Sierra Leone Ports and Harbours Authority management. The Sierra Leone government, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has remained silent on the incident. Officials are reportedly working behind the scenes to address what has been described as a disgraceful scenario. The post triggered widespread reactions from Sierra Leoneans, with many expressing shock and demanding transparency in the investigation. Social media and radio platforms have been filled with discussions about the scandal and its potential impact on Sierra Leones international reputation. To promote truth in public discourse, DUBAWA decided to investigate the claims made by the newspaper. Among the issues for verification are: To ascertain the truthfulness of the newspapers allegations, DUBAWA contacted them to provide evidence of the claims, particularly whether or not there has been a drug-related offence and whether or not the ambassador is or was under House arrest at some point. The newspaper has yet to respond to the questions. DUBAWA then contacted Timothy Kabba, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, who explained that seven suitcases of drugs, along with $2,000, were found in the Embassys utility vehiclenot 380 kilograms of cocaine or $100,000. He also emphasised that the government is conducting a thorough investigation to determine how the vehicle became linked to illegal substances and to ensure those responsible are held accountable. The minister denied that the Ambassador had been put under house arrest and said the Ambassador was in Sierra Leone. He assured the public that Sierra Leone is working closely with Guinean authorities to uncover the facts. He also stated that the government has even issued a press release stating its response to the arrest of the Embassy vehicle. Chernor Bah, Minister of Information and Civic Education, corroborated this account. In a press statement, Mr Bah stated that he and the Minister of Foreign Affairs held a press conference to clarify the situation. Minister Bah also confirmed that the Gleaner newspapers claims were baseless and made before the press briefing; he also urged citizens to remain calm and trust the governments handling of the issue. DUBAWAs investigations show that there is a drug-related scandal involving the Ambassadors vehicle, which has since been impounded. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that the Sierra Leone Ambassador to Guinea is under house arrest following the arrest of his driver, who was found with 380 kilograms of cocaine and $100,000, which is false.",1
"Claim: An online medium published a supplementary list of the Nigerian Navy Recruitment in 2020 claims all 44 successful candidates are Northerners. This publication is false and misleading. The Nigerian Navy has debunked the list as fake. The above is the headline and a screenshot of a news update from an online news platform Sahara Reporters on 12th July, 2021. The publication purported that candidates on the Nigerian Navy Supplementary List under the Buhari Government are all Northerners. How true is this? This claim is questionable as the Nigerian Navy had always ensured equal representation of all the regions in all its lists of successful candidates for its recruitments. Did the Nigerian Navy release a supplementary list? Dubawa searched the Nigerian Navy website, where it found the Nigerian Navy recruitment and enlistment portal . The portal announces the LIST OF SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES FOR THE NIGERIAN NAVY BASIC TRAINING SCHOOL BATCHES 31 AND 32 and presents an item list for shortlisted candidates as well as the list of names which was provided at the bottom of the page. The list was released in two batches as PDF files, titled batches 31 and 32 . Further, Dubawa found that the lists published by the Nigerian Navy has candidates from all states and each PDF has 21 pages each. Batch 31 has 16 names from the FCT, 22 from Niger, 23 from Ondo and Taraba states while the remaining states have 24 names each. 852 names in total. Batch 32 has 851 names in all: FCT has 16 candidates, Niger and Ondo states 22, Taraba 23, Other states 24. However, Dubawa did not see a supplementary list on the Navy website and wondered why the list would not be published on the same platform that houses the original lists. Another thing worthy of question is why the Nigerian Navy would adopt different formats for the purported list. The arrangement and general outlook of the lists are different; Nigerian Navy made provision for three columns for names on the original lists published on its website (Surname, First name, other name(s)) while the list on the alleged supplementary list has only two columns for names (Surname and First name). In additional search by Dubawa, it found a disclaimer issued by the Naval Headquarters, distancing itself from the purported supplementary list. A call to a reporter with Armed Forces radio requested anonymity due to service rules. While addressing a question about the veracity of the purported supplementary list, she said a statement has already been issued through the Navy Director of Information, Suleman Dahun, referring to the statement Dubawa has embedded above. Further Search by Dubawa showed that no credible media organization has published reports of any supplementary list of the successful candidates from one particular zone of the country. In contradiction to the claim that the Nigerian Navy released a supplementary list which contains 44 names from the north, Dubawa found that there is no such list as the Nigerian Navy has debunked the claim in a press statement. In addition to this, no credible media platform has published the news. Hence, this claim is false. The fact check was produced per Dubawa 2021 Kwame Karikari fellowship in partnership with National Orientation Agency (NOA) to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"The Liberia government shuts down the border with Sierra Leone, according to Sierra Loaded news report and social media users. Verdict: TRUE. The official spokesperson of the Liberia Immigration Service (LIS), Mr Abraham Dorley, told DUBAWA via a telephone conversation that the government of Liberia shut down all of its borders ahead of the election day. Mr Dorley said that it is a regular routine carried out by the LIS during election processes. Yes, we closed all our borders effectively on Monday, Oct. 9, 2023, and they will be reopened on Wednesday, 11, 2023, Dorley said.",1
"Imagine satire as a mischievous jester in a grand medieval court. Clad in a patchwork of vibrant colours and jingling bells, the jester dances around the room, twisting and turning in exaggerated gestures. With a grin that hints at knowing secrets, he holds up a mirror, reflecting the follies of the court for all to see. His humour is sharp, his antics exaggerated, and his purpose is clear: to reveal the truth beneath the pomp and pretence. This jesters mirror is not just any reflective surface; its a puzzle of irony and exaggeration. Every twist and turn shows the flaws and pretensions of those it reflects, changing them into comically absurd shapes. The audience, entertained and provoked, cant help but laugh while seeing the deeper truths hidden behind the humour. Satire, in essence, is this jesters art. It employs wit and exaggeration to challenge societal norms, reveal hidden truths, and critique the powerful, all while keeping its audience in stitches. Its a dance of humour and critique, where the jest is both a playful jest and a pointed jab aimed at making us reflect on the worlds idiocy and our place within it. However, this powerful tool is not without its pitfalls. It can sometimes contribute to misinformation, blurring the lines between fact and fiction and leading to unintended consequences. 1. Exaggeration and Misinterpretation Satire often employs hyperbole to make a point, but this exaggeration can be misinterpreted as literal truth. For instance, a satirical news article that depicts a politician engaging in ridiculous behaviour might be taken literally by some readers, leading them to form skewed perceptions of the politicians actual actions or character. 2. Confirmation Bias Content that aligns with existing beliefs or biases can reinforce false information. When satire reflects or exaggerates a persons pre-existing views, it can validate and amplify them, leading individuals to accept distorted or misleading information as fact. 3. Lack of Context Satire often depends on specific cultural or political contexts for its humour and critique to be fully understood. The content can be misinterpreted when the context is unfamiliar, potentially leading to confusion or misinformation. For instance, a viral 7-minute video on WhatsApp in Ghana falsely depicts former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson being interrogated by a fictional team, AC-12. The video, created by the group Led by Donkeys, parodies Johnson using clips from the series Line of Duty and his public speeches. While the parody was clear to a British audience, some viewers in Ghana believed the video was real. 4. Selective Sharing On social media, satirical content is often shared without context or acknowledgement of its satirical nature. When users share satirical posts as if they were factual news, this can lead to the spread of misinformation. The rapid dissemination of such content can amplify misinformation and confuse the public. 1. Political Satire Political satire often targets public figures and policies with exaggerated portrayals. For instance, satirical cartoons depicting politicians as bumbling or corrupt can sometimes be interpreted as accurate representations of their behaviour. This misinterpretation can misalign public opinion and contribute to misinformation about political figures and their actions. For instance, a TikTok video circulated in Sierra Leone featuring a man dressed in military uniform, warning that his troops would take over the country within 24 hours if the upcoming election wasnt free and fair. Upon investigation, DUBAWA confirmed that the man in the video is a comedian who performs under the persona of President Abundura of the fictional Laughter Republic. His mistake in stating the election date as June 23 instead of June 24 and his identification as a comedian on social media proved the video to be a satirical skit rather than a real threat. 2. Social Media Satire This type of satire can be seen in posts on platforms like Twitter, Facebook and TikTok, which are particularly prone to misinterpretation. A satirical tweet mocking a government policy might be retweeted and shared as if it were a factual report, leading others to believe in the existence of a policy or event that never actually occurred. A fake Facebook account impersonating Montserrado County lawmaker Yekeh Kolubah has posted insulting remarks and memes, targeting female representative aspirant Karishma Pelham Raad ahead of the 2023 National Elections. The account posted derogatory comments, leading some to believe it belonged to Kolubah due to his reputation for outspoken criticism. However, after contacting both the account user and Kolubah, DUBAWA affirmed that the account was fake and not linked to the lawmaker. See more instances of social media satire here , here and here . 3. Cultural and Religious Satire Content that satirises cultural or religious practices can be especially problematic. Some might take exaggerated portrayals of religious figures or rituals literally, leading to misunderstandings and the spread of misinformation about those practices or beliefs. For example, In 2019, a viral video showed South African pastor Alpha Lukau allegedly resurrecting a man during a church service. It was later revealed to be staged, with the man already alive before the event. However, the dramatic nature of the video fuelled confirmation bias in viewers predisposed to believe in miraculous events, leading many to accept the resurrection as real. Pastor Lukau later apologised for the misleading act, which sparked online satire, including the #ResurrectionChallenge, mocking the exaggerated religious claim. When mistaken for fact, satire can distort public perception, leading to misunderstandings about real-world issues. This confusion can weaken trust in legitimate news sources, as people may become sceptical of the media when satirical content is believed to be true. Additionally, satire that reinforces stereotypes or biases can intensify societal divides, amplifying existing prejudices and creating further conflict. Mitigation Strategies 1. Labelling and Transparency Satire should be clearly labelled as satire to prevent misunderstandings. Clear disclaimers and contextual information can help readers recognise the intent behind the content and avoid misinterpretation. 2. Media Literacy Promoting media literacy is essential for helping the public critically engage with satirical content. Educating individuals about the nature of satire and its role in commentary can help them distinguish between satire and factual reporting. 3. Responsible Satire Satirists and media outlets have a responsibility to ensure their content is not misconceived as factual. By providing context and being mindful of potential misunderstandings, satirists can mitigate the risk of contributing to misinformation. Satire remains a valuable and potent social critique, providing insights into societal flaws and injustices through humour and exaggeration. However, its potential to promote misinformation underscores the need for careful consideration and responsible presentation. Recognising the nuances of satire is crucial in preventing the spread of falsehoods.",1
"Claim : A Facebook user has alleged that the Nigerian media mogul Taiwo Olayinka Afolabi has bought the Banjul Port terminal in The Gambia. Verdict : This is false. DUBAWAs checks have revealed that the Gambia Ports have not been sold to the Nigerian Taiwo Olayinka Afolabi, as alleged. Instead, a businessman-owned company has a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government of The Gambia to build and operate a dry port, SIFAX Group announced on Aug. 14, 2018. Also, the Gambia Ports Authority Public Relations Officer, Gibou M. Saidy , has refuted the claim, describing it as false. A Facebook user claimed the Nigerian media owner Taiwo Olayinka Afolabi has bought the Banjul Port Terminal. Writing on Facebook on May 7, 2024, the social media user said: According to Nigerian media, multimillionaire Barrister Taiwo Olayinka Afolabi recently bought the Banjul Ports Terminal. Which terminal? The Gambia Ports Authority should clarify. Mr Afolabi is the Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of SIFAX Group, a group of companies with investments in maritime, aviation, oil and gas, haulage and logistics, financial services, and hospitality. The data on Facebook shows the post has received over 1,230 comments, 49 shares, and over 2,234 likes as of May 11, 2024. DUBAWA also traced the claim to a post made by an X user (formerly Twitter) on May 1, 2024, when celebrating the achievement of the Nigerian businessman on his 62nd birthday. Extolling the work of the media mogul, the X user claimed Taiwo recently bought the Banjul Ports Terminal. This post on X may be the source of the claim making the rounds on social media in The Gambia. We decided to probe the allegation as part of our campaign against misinformation and disinformation in West Africa. DUBAWAs checks revealed that a company owned by the media mogul has a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the government of The Gambia to build and operate a dry port, SIFAX Group announced on August 14, 2018. The MoU was reportedly signed in Banjul by the Group Managing Director of SIFAX Group, John Jenkins, and the Managing Director of Gambia Ports Authority (GPA), Abdoulie Tambedou, in 2018. Also, the Gambia Ports Authority Public Relations Officer, Gibou M. Saidy, refuted the claim with some strong words. It is one of the biggest fake news stories I have heard in the year. The Gambia has no intention of selling any part of our terminals to any Nigerian or billionaire in Nigeria because we dont have a terminal system, he told DUBAWA. He noted that The Gambia has only two wharves the old and the new. The government, he explained, is in discussion with some investors about a public-private partnership contract to bring progress at the ports. As far as I am concerned, and the management of the Gambia Ports Authority is concerned, nothing has been sold to anyone, Mr Saidy stressed. A Google keyword search conducted by DUBAWA also showed that no media organisation in The Gambia had published news reports about the purported sale of the countrys Port to the Nigerian. Similarly, the SIFAX Group, owned by Mr Afolabi, has published its MoU with The Gambian government on its website but did not say anything about purchasing the Banjul ports terminal. It is not true that Nigerian businessman, Taiwo Afolabi, has purchased Gambia Ports. The Public Relations Officer of the Gambia Ports Authority , Gibou M. Saidy, refuted the allegation. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2024 Kwame Karikari Fellowship, in partnership with Fact Check Centre Gambia, to facilitate the spirit of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy.",1
"CLAIM : An X user, @hon_sadiq claimed that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) held a press conference and announced Edo election results. The claim was also shared on Facebook as seen here and here . FINDINGS: Checks by the NFC show that the PDP leadership addressed the press in the early hours of Sunday, Sept 22 in Benin city, Edo state. During the press conference, the governor of Adamawa state, Ahmadu Fintiri reeled out results reportedly collated by the agents of the party in some Local Government Areas of the state. However, he later clarified that he did not announce results but only informed the public of the exact figures from the partys agents. VERDICT: CORRECT SOURCES: PulseNG, The Cable",1
"A video posted on Facebook in Nigeria claims that a mixture of watermelon and cuttlebone is a remedy for high blood pressure. The video shows a man holding half a watermelon and a piece of cuttlebone. He gives instructions and explains the benefits of the mixture in Yoruba, one of the languages spoken in Nigeria. He grinds the cuttlebone into a powder and slightly crushes the watermelon before mixing the two. The video has been viewed over 248,000 times with 900 comments. High blood pressure , or hypertension, occurs when the force of the blood against the artery walls is consistently too high, causing the heart to work harder. Lifestyle changes such as eating a low-salt diet, losing weight and being physically active can help lower high blood pressure. Watermelon is a juicy fruit from a plant in the gourd family, originally from tropical Africa and now grown all over the world. It contains vitamins A and C and is usually eaten raw. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines cuttlebone as the shell of a cuttlefish that is sometimes used for polishing powder or for supplying cage birds with lime and salts. Cuttlefish live in shallow tropical or temperate coastal waters. The video claiming this watermelon-cuttlebone mixture can cure high blood pressure has been posted here , here and here . (Note: See more instances listed at the end of this report.) No scientific evidence to back it up Watermelon is rich in vitamin C which helps to improve the skin but it has not been proven to treat high blood pressure, Dr Akinsegun Akinbami told Africa Check. He is a professor of haematology in the faculty of basic clinical sciences at Lagos State University , Nigeria. For many years, there has been no specific treatment for high blood pressure. People are only advised to take safe precautions like using a sphygmomanometer , an electric blood pressure monitor, to regularly check their blood pressure before it gets problematic, Akinbami said. So, combining watermelon and cuttlebone for high blood pressure is deliberate misinformation to mislead people as there has been no scientific evidence to back it up. We also found no credible scientific evidence to support this claim. The claim that watermelon and cuttlebone treat high blood pressure is false and has not been scientifically proven. Seek medical advice instead. The same video has been republished here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"Claim: The image of the highway road is in Nigeria, the giant of Africa. Verdict: FALSE. Google Lens and Google Earth reveal the highway is Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai, while geolocation publications further attest to it. Since the West African nation gained independence, Nigeria has been widely regarded as the Giant of Africa due to its large land mass, cultural diversity, huge population, and huge oil production. However, poor leadership and gross corruption have kept the nation underdeveloped for most of its post-independence era. A Facebook user, David Samson Abj, in a Facebook group, Breaking News in Nigeria, linked part of an ultra-modern city highway to Nigeria and suggested the development further makes the country the Giant of Africa. Nigeria remains the giant of Africa, the Facebook user wrote. Along with the post, he added a photo of a busy highway, with multiple cars plying its numerous lanes, to depict his assertion. Facebook users engaged in the post, which has gained 72 reactions, 99 comments and two shares as of Saturday, September 9, 2023. Many dismissed the claim as untrue. This is not Nigeria, stated Ezekudele Lar. There is no keke on this road, King Ezugwu contended . Nigeria will be there soon if mediocrity is shown (the) exit door, commented Francis Uguru. To clear all doubts, we decided to fact-check the claim. We conducted a Google reverse search, using Google Lens, on the image, and it presented similar images identified as Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai. Further analysis of the location on Google Earth showed an identical locality representation. We observed that all locations around the images are in Dubai. Similar images of the road also surfaced in a publication by Golden Bee estate, which links it as the main road artery in the emirate of Dubai. AutoJosh also published an article about the highway. The publication identifies the Sheikh Zayed Road as a 558.44km area, named after the then President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, His Highness Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan. The article further revealed it is one of the highways that connects the seven emirates. The claim is false. Google reverse search and Google Earth analysed the image as Sheikh Zayed Road in Dubai.",0
"Claim: A viral Twitter screenshot claims the RCCG launched an online dating website While it is true that a dating website was launched by an RCCG parish(branch) not the entire RCCG; TODAYs headline did not give the right context. The screenshot of a Twitter post by TODAY.ng, a news blog, which recently went viral on social media, especially WhatsApp, claims the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) launched an online dating website. This claim led to several reactions and comments on Twitter with some persons creating online profiles for the dating website, memes etc. A Twitter user Daniel Regha (@ DanielRegha ) criticised this move, saying with the high level of insecurity in Nigeria at the moment, this move by the church is not smart. He also believes people will be deceived as it will be believed that everyone on that platform would be a decent man/woman. Another user Omotara Akanni (@ _theladymo )posted her own profile with a name, age and phone number. The controversial nature of this claim prompted us to do this fact-check. Verification Dubawa traced and found the original tweet by TODAY ( @todayng ) published on Thursday, December 2, 2021 at 1:37pm. This confirms the screenshot is an actual tweet that originated from TODAY. The tweet when found had garnered 819 retweets, 1,234 quote tweets and 1,422 likes. Attached to this tweet is the link to the story by TODAY. A keyword search led to the same story on TODAYs website with the headline RCCG launches online dating site. According to this report, the City of David Parish, under the leadership of pastor Idowu Iluyomade, launched an online christian dating platform for mature singles. Other News platforms like Channels Tv, Punch etc also published this story. The news report by Channels Tv carried a different headline, No Marriage In Heaven: RCCG Parish Opens Online Dating Site. The report noted that this was by the City of David parish in Victoria Island, Lagos. On the other hand, the report by Punch had the headline RCCG parish creates dating website for Christian singles. This report which quoted churchtimesnigeria.net as its source identified the said website address to be connectnow.com.ng . Considering the varying headlines, Dubawa visited the RCCGs website but found nothing of that nature. We went ahead to message the call centre contact found on the website on WhatsApp which confirmed that the Lagos parish did launch a website. Good Morning, this is true. the reply read . Dubawa also visited the website identified by Punchs report and observed that signup had been disabled on the website with a message that registration for connection was now closed. Our findings and the notice at the call centre of RCCGs website confirm a dating website was launched by one of RCCG parishes, not the entire RCCG. TODAYs headline did not give the right context, making it misleading.",1
"CLAIM: INEC has uploaded National Assembly election results on the IReV portal but has yet to do so for presidential elections. VERDICT: False Reactions worldwide have followed the February 25th presidential election in Africas biggest democracy, which produced Bola Tinubu as Nigerias next leader. Mr Tinubu was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Major opposition parties in the fiercely contested polls have refused to concede defeat, and the two closest contestants have formally challenged the results in court. Mr Tinubu, 70, scored 8,794,726 votes, the highest of all the candidates. His closest rival, Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), scored 6,984,520 votes to emerge second in the election, while Labour Partys Peter Obi got a total of 6,101,533. PDPs Mr Atiku called the result a rape of democracy after getting 29 per cent of the vote, and Labour Partys Mr Obi, who got 25 per cent, told supporters they had been robbed of victory and said the elections is worst in Nigerias recent history. The opposition parties are lamenting the inability of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to upload screenshots of polling station results to a central portal, IReV, created for the purpose. INECs guideline for the election explicitly states that results from each of the more than 176,000 polling stations will be electronically transmitted to the commissions collation system and also uploaded to its website. But that was not possible with INEC apologising for technical glitches. As Mr Obi and Mr Atiku continue their challenge of the presidential elections results for not being uploaded on IReV timely, they have ironically endorsed and celebrated some of the election results at the national legislative levels favourable to their parties. The Elections of the federal lawmakers were simultaneously held on the same day as the presidential election. For instance, on 8 March, Mr Obi organised a dinner for the elected legislative members of the Labour Party. This evening, I hosted the welcome dinner for Labour Party Senators and Members of the House of Representatives in Abuja, he wrote on Twitter with pictures attached from the event. The senator-elect of the FCT, Ireti Kingibe, also posted: The elected Senators and House of Representative members of our great party came together to dine and celebrate with each other in harmony. Thank you @PeterObi, for hosting us. Then, On 10 March, the PDP National Youth Coordinator, Abba Kadade, led the partys members-elect of the House of Representatives in Kaduna State to meet Atiku. The Labour Party won 40 seats in the National Assembly, 6 Senates and 34 House of Representative positions. On the other hand, the PDP got 29 seats in the Senate and 102 in the House of Representatives. The APC won most of the seats, with 57 in the Senate and 162 in the House of Representatives. The results of the Senate and House of Representatives elections are expected to be uploaded and published on the IReV portal at the end of voting. Some public commentators have claimed that INEC has since uploaded the national legislative-level election results. In a widely circulated video , Emmanuel Ogebe, the Coordinator of Washington-based Democratic Election Monitoring Observers (DEMO), said: Just to show you the extent of the mischief that occurred, the result of National Assembly elections which happened at the same time simultaneously with presidential elections results were able to be uploaded on IReV but the presidential election results were not uploaded. Till this moment, the results have not been completely uploaded, Mr Ogebe said at an event on 8 March in Washington. Then a Twitter user Daniel Okezue wrote : I told you that @inecnigeria could not be trusted. I told you that elections are not rigged at PUs but at collation centres. Whatever makes you able to upload National Assembly results but couldnt upload the presidential is the beginning of rigging. INEC has to answer for this. One of Mr Obis special advisers, Valentine Ozigbo, wrote : INEC officials uploaded the results of the National Assembly elections to the server without hitches. But how true is the claim that INEC has uploaded the National Assembly elections results on IReV but has yet to do so for the presidential election? PREMIUM TIMES extracted data on the INEC portal on Monday, 27 March, and we discovered that out of 176,846, INEC has uploaded 166,656 polling unit results from presidential elections. This represents 94.24 per cent. The electoral commission is still expected to upload 10,190 polling units results. On the other hand, INEC has uploaded 150,281 polling units results for senatorial elections on the IReV portal, representing 84.97 per cent of the total. As for the House of Representatives, the electoral commission has uploaded 152,055 polling units results from federal constituencies on IReV. This represents 85.98 per cent of the results. A review of the results by PREMIUM TIMES shows that as of Monday, 27 March, only 48 per cent of FCT senatorial elections results were published on IReV. INEC has published only 1,356 out of 2,822 polling unit results in the FCT senatorial district. Similarly, only 78 per cent of senatorial election results in Akwa Ibom South are uploaded on IReV. PDPs Ekong Samson is the senator-elect of the Akwa Ibom Senatorial South district election. The electoral commission uploaded only 996 out of 1275 polling units results in the senatorial district. Then in Delta Central, INEC published 1399 out of 2180 polling units results of the senatorial elections. This represents 64.17 per cent of the final results that produced APCs Ede Dafinone. Using official data from Nigerias electoral umpire, INEC, we found that out of 176,846, INEC has uploaded 166,656 polling unit results from presidential elections. This represents 94.24 per cent. On the other hand, INEC has published 150,281 (84.97 per cent) of the total results of senatorial elections and 152,055 (85.98 per cent) of the House of Representatives elections results uploaded on the IReV portal as of Monday, 27 March. Therefore it is false and misleading to say INEC has uploaded the results of national legislative elections but has yet to publish the presidential elections results. The data shows that INEC has uploaded and published more presidential election results on IReV than national assembly elections.

"Claim: A photo making the rounds on the social media shows an organ trafficking alert purportedly issued by the Office on Drugs and Crime department of the United Organisations (UNODC) urging readers to beware of agents/companies offering them jobs abroad. No, this alert didnt originate from the UNODC; its only a mimicry of another publication on the departments website. Organ trafficking, under the broader spectrum of human trafficking and migrant smuggling, has remained a huge problem the United Nations, other international bodies and governments of various countries seek to tackle. The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons Especially Women and Children, provides the sole internationally accepted definition of trafficking in persons. Article 3 (a) of the protocol stipulates that Trafficking in Persons shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include at a minimum the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of human organs. It has been identified that migrants seeking greener pastures in other countries but do not have the option to migrate legally form the majority of those who fall victim to these organ harvesters. Some victims are tricked or coerced into having their organs removed, UNODC says. Several programmes have been organised to curb the spread of this menace by educating the people on the need for a legal migration process. These programmes are handled by organizations such as the International Organization for Migration among others. Trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal is not a new phenomenon. Over the years, the crime has received significant attention from media, NGOs, academia and also from international and regional actors. These include the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially in women and children, Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Being and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Also, in 2013, the UN Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly adopted resolutions that inter alia request UNODC to collect and analyse information on trafficking in persons for organ removal and encourage Member States to provide to UNODC evidence-based data on patterns, forms and flows of trafficking in persons, including for the purpose of the removal of organs respectively. It has, however, remained a persistent problem, hence the focus. The international (transplant) community has developed standards and guidelines to govern transplantation, to regulate care for donors and thereby prevent organ-related crimes, including trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal. Of particular relevance are the WHO Guiding Principles on Human Cell, Tissue and Organ Transplantation, as well as the Declaration of Istanbul on Organ Trafficking and Transplant Tourism. Particularly in Nigeria, the establishment of the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) on 14 July 2013 shows a concerted effort to put a stop to trafficking and consequently organ trafficking. The photo (pictured below) has been circulated on social media as an organ trafficking alert from the UNODC establishing the fact that there is a black market for human body parts. The alert highlighted the most valuable organs and listed the cost of each one in dollars. According to the alert, a kidney is said to cost $262,000 (N107, 813, 000); a heart goes for $119,000 (N48, 968, 500) and a liver $157,000 (N64, 605, 500). It reads, The black market for parts of the human body is booming in the Middle East. A kidney now costs 262,000 dollars (131 million CFA francs); the heart costs 119,000 dollars (60 million CFA francs) and the liver costs 157,000 dollars (79 million CFA francs). Beware of fake foreign agencies promising to make you work abroad. They process your papers, pay your plane ticket and just take you abroad pretending they want to find you a job, but instead, they kill their victims, recover all the precious parts of their bodies. Many people have been offered jobs in the Middle East and so far their families have been unable to locate them. Share to save lives. This has been shared on some websites and across social media platforms such as Nairaland , a blog and on Facebook . According to a global report from 2020, while still detected in small numbers, trafficking for the purpose of organ removal was reported in North Africa, South and South-East Asia, Central America and Europe during the reporting period. It indicated that in 2017, about 25 victims were reported, and in 2018, this number had risen to more than 40. Meanwhile, females comprised most of the victims trafficked for sexual exploitation, and two-thirds of the victims were trafficked for forced labour. Most of the men were trafficked for organ removal. A link on the alert was entered and it brought out an error result. It is, however, observed that it is a mimicry of an archived link from UNODC. While the comments on the photo highlighted the prices of human organs in the black market noting that it is on the rise in the Middle East, the archived link from the UNODC states that desperate situations of recipients and donors of human organs create an avenue for exploitation by international organ trafficking syndicated. It also stated that victims of these crimes could be vulnerable by virtue of poverty. Dubawa also observed that the alert has previously been flagged by the AFP fact-check which stated that UNODC Pakistan had confirmed that the purported alert is fake. AFP quoted the regional branch of the UNODC as saying that the message does not originate from UNODC and contains out-of-date information that is not related to current UNODC activities. The photo had not originated from the United Nations as the body is yet to give a warning about a black market for human organs in the Middle East. Although there are efforts to curb the menace of organ trafficking by the organization, the Middle East was not one of the continents highlighted in past reports regarding this. Also, the UNODC is yet to give a cost for each vital human part.

"Claim: A photo of a man in Biafran apparel, standing on Nigerias flag at an event which looks like a protest ground outside Nigeria, has a caption that suggests the person is Oseloka Obi, son of a frontline presidential candidate, Peter Obi. There is no evidence to show that the person in the viral photo is Peter Obis son. Mr Obis media team however described the photo as unrelated. On Sunday, July 3, 2022, social media was awash with photos of two young men placed side-by-side to depict that Oseloka Obi, son of the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, was standing on Nigerias flag and advocating for actualisation of Biafra Republic. While one of the photos was that of a man in Biafran apparel standing on a Nigerian flag, the other is a headshot of Oseloka Obi. The photos were widely circulated on Twitter and Facebook with several comments suggesting that Peter Obi cannot be trusted with the future of Nigeria. One of the tweets with the photos was captioned: 2023: Peter Obi and the Dilemma of Nation Building- The man standing on the defaced Nigerian flag is Gregory Oseloka Obi, the son of the Labour Partys presidential candidate, @peterObi. Think deeply before you hand over Nigeria to his father to manage. DUBAWA observed that the photos have generated arguments between supporters of Mr Obi and other social media users. A Twitter user, Bettors Companion asked the presidential candidate to apologize because of the tweet portraying his son in a bad light. He wrote, @peterObi please come and apologise for this tweet which portrays your son in a bad light. Another user, @OKARIA noted, How old is he; is he a child or an adult? If he is a child ask his father, if he is an adult hold him responsible for his action. You are complaining about the man standing on the flag, not those that fired the shots that soiled the flag. # cheap blackmail. Some users were, however, quick to note that the photo was fake and unrelated. Looking at the controversies the photo has generated give Dubawa a reason to verify the claim. DUBAWA conducted a Google reverse image search on the photo of the man with a Biafran crested vest. Results from the search show that the earliest version of the photo appeared online on 1st September 2021 in a tweet by a Pro-Biafra Twitter account created in August 2020. The tweet had a caption: That is the zoo Flag. Nice one. Further search by DUBAWA showed that the same photo since 2021 has been widely circulated on social media by pro-Biafra agitators as seen here , here among other places. In the photo, there was a police vehicle in the background of the post. However, checks by DUBAWA show that the car is a German police car in Munich . When DUBAWA conducted a keyword search, protest of Biafra in Germany, it led us to a report by Saharareporters with a caption: Biafra Supporters Storm British Embassy In Germany, Demand Nnamdi Kanus Release. According to the report , the Biafra supporters staged a demonstration at the British Embassy in Berlin, Germany over the arrest of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu by the Nigerian government. Shreds of evidence gathered from the footage of a video attached to the report led DUBAWA to a live stream on a Biafra Facebook page . The video was captioned: IPOB demand the release of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu and a referendum on #Baifraexist. DUBAWA discovered that the placards and environment where the photo was taken were the same as the one in the video . When DUBAWA conducted another reverse image search on the second photo in the post , results show that the image belongs to Oseloka Obi, the son of Peter Obi. DUBAWA discovered that Oseloka Obi is a Hollywood actor and a member of the Actors Guild of Great Britain UK and goes by the stage name ELOKA IVO. An image comparison of Oseloka Obi and the man with a Biafran crested vest showed some remarkable differences in size and other features. Although DUBAWA could not get details about the man standing on the Nigerian flag in the video, findings from an in-depth analysis suggest that Oseloka Obi is different from the person the social media users were trying to portray him to be. He lives in the UK, but the protest where the photo was taken happened in Germany. Also, DUBAWA contacted Valentine Obienyem, the media adviser to Mr Obi who described the tweets as desperation of the opposition. Mr Obienyem insisted that Oseloka Obi, who lives in the UK, did not step on Nigerias flag. He added, the said young man is not Mr. Peter Obis son, who, by his strict upbringing marked by rigorous discipline, understands what civic duty and responsibilities entail. Mr. Oseloka Obi is about six feet and taller than his father; while the young man they used for the mischief is slightly above 5 feet. There is no evidence to show that the person in the viral photo is Peter Obis son. Mr Obis media team described the photo as unrelated while DUBAWA discovered that the photo was taken during a protest in Germany.",1
"Claim: Social media messages suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine can transmit COVID-19 and may be responsible for hike in COVID-19 Cases in Liberia Although there has been a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia, there is no evidence that the administration of the AstraZeneca Vaccine is responsible for this. The suggestion that the vaccine can cause COVID-19 is FALSE. A new COVID-19 variant has emerged in Liberia as the country records a new peak in infections. While virus mutations are not unusual, those that are more infectious are worrisome, making people respond in different ways across various social media platforms. Speculations have emerged in street corners that the wave of increase in COVID-19 cases in Liberia can be attributed to the Astrazeneca vaccine being administered across the country. On Saturday June 19, 2021, a Facebook user shared a post questioning whether or not it was the vaccine causing an increase in infection. In the post which has since been deleted, the user asked his Facebook following: have we noticed since the introduction of the vaccines, the cases have hiked? Roll-out of the AstraZeneca Vaccine The World Health Organization (WHO) early this year listed AstraZeneca and Oxford Universitys COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, widening access to the relatively inexpensive shot in the developing world. AWHOstatement said it had approved the vaccine as produced by AstraZeneca-SKBio (Republic of Korea) and the Serum Institute of India. According to a study by the US Center for Disease Control , AstraZeneca committed to a partnership with Oxford University to ensure broad and equitable vaccine access globally during the pandemic. Liberia received 96,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, through the COVAX facility on April 1, 2021, joining many countries to officially launch the vaccination campaign against COVID-19. The Minister of Health, Dr. Wilhelmina Jallah, launched the vaccine at the Ministerial Complex in the presence of the UN Head of Agencies, the United Kingdom and European Union Ambassadors, representatives of other development partners, Cabinet Ministers, chairs of the health committees at the legislature, senior government officials and the media. The vaccines were later deployed to eight sites in Montserrado and Margibi counties including; the Number 14 Military hospital, JFK memorial hospital, Catholic hospital, Redemption and SOS Hospitals. Dr Wilhemina Jallah, Liberias Minister of Health in a phone call with his reporter on Wednesday June 23, 2021 dismissed this claim. Dr Jallah said the Ministry of Health was in possession of no reports or evidence that suggest that the vaccine is capable of infecting people with COVID-19. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) , the AstraZeneca vaccines were tested in state-of-the-art laboratories, tried in thousands of renowned clinics and approved by WHO. The same vaccines are being administered all over the world, including countries in Africa, like Ghana, Sierra Leone, Mali and Morocco. Dubawa found no evidence that the AstraZeneca vaccine can get people infected with COVID-19 in any of these countries. According to a recent study by the UK based Public Health England , a single dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or AstraZeneca vaccine reduced household transmission by up to half. It finds no evidence that AstraZeneca vaccine, which is also administered in Liberia, can also cause COVID infection. The Australian Governments Department of Health s patient information fact-sheet on AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) also finds no evidence that the vaccine can infect people with COVID-19 once taken. The US Center for Disease Control says after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, the vaccinated person cannot test positive for COVID-19 on a viral test a test which is used to determine if an individual has a current infection. The CDC further states that none of the authorized and recommended COVID-19 vaccines cause a person to test positive on viral tests , which are used to see if one has a current infection. Neither can any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials in the United States. Cases of fully vaccinated individuals contracting coronavirus are rare, but not impossible. The CDC says a small percentage of fully vaccinated individuals will still get the infection but may make sickness less severe in such people. Given the scientific evidence available, the suggestion that AstraZeneca could be responsible for hundreds of new COVID-19 cases in Liberia is FALSE and Misleading.

"Claim : Forty-two Malaria drugs have been banned by the European Union. Verdict: FALSE. Our findings show this message is from a 2017 news story, and the listed drugs are not used in Nigeria. Malaria, a life-threatening disease, is spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes, mostly found in tropical countries. Although dangerous, it is preventable and curable. The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that its African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. Recently, a Viral WhatsApp message announced the ban on 42 malaria drugs by the European Union (EU). The message further warns against drugs that contain Plasmotrin, Artequin, Co-arinate, Arco, Artedar, Artecon, and Dailquin. This message which has been forwarded many times, was sent to DUBAWA for verification. Public Health is an important issue, and this serious assertion calls for interrogation to ensure the public is properly guided to make the best decision hence the need for this certification. A keyword search led to different news reports by Premium Times, Tribune Online , Daily Post , and Daily Trust in July 2017 on an alleged list of 42 banned drugs by the EU in Nigeria. West Field Development Initiative shared the same claim in August 2022 with the narrative that the 42 banned drugs by the EU are still in circulation. Following these assertions, reports by Premium Times , and the Guardian revealed that the Nigerian Senate investigated the circulation of these drugs in 2017. Still, we found no follow-up report on the findings of their investigations. In the same year, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) also clarified that the speculation that 42 anti-malaria drugs banned by the EU were still circulating in the country is a misconception . The agency explained that the banned drugs are oral monotherapies containing single Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients, API such as Artesunate as contained in Arinate tablets which are quite different from the recommended Anti-Malaria drugs used in Nigeria. We also tried to find any document or press release by the EU announcing the ban on the listed drugs but found nothing outside news reports that trended in Nigeria in 2017. We visited the website of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and downloaded its guidelines for malaria treatment . This guideline recommends using Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) to treat adults and children with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria (including infants, pregnant women in their second and third trimesters and breastfeeding women). The WHO-approved first-line ACT options are artemether + lumefantrine, artesunate + amodiaquine, artesunate + mefloquine, dihydroartemisinin + piperaquine and artesunate + sulfadoxinepyrimethamine. These options are recommended for adults and children, including infants, lactating women and pregnant women in their second and third trimesters. Artemisinin + naphthoquinone is also a combination of two relatively old compounds currently being promoted as a single-dose regimen, contrary to WHO advice for three days of the artemisinin derivative. There is insufficient data from rigorously conducted randomised controlled trials to make general recommendations. In both adults and children, parenteral artesunate prevented more deaths than parenteral quinine (high-quality evidence). Artesunate is given as a bolus for intravenous administration, whereas quinine requires slow infusion. For intramuscular administration, artesunate is given in a smaller volume than quinine. For more clarity on the Nigerian context, we contacted the spokesperson of NAFDAC, Jimoh Abubakar, on the authenticity of these claims and the safety of the listed drugs and components. While he acknowledged our request and promised to take it up and get back to us, we are yet to get a response at the time of publishing. After checking for it on the website, we also requested a list of approved malaria drugs from the agency and got no response. Jeremiah Agim, a consultant at the National Hospital Abuja, said antimalaria is used in Nigeria with some of the listed agents. However, he noted he was unsure if the message addressed the brands or the agents. I dont know anything about these. Is this message about the brand or Antimalarial with the above-listed active agents or the drugs? I know antimalarial with some of the listed active agents is in use. Sunday Idoko, another Doctor at Garki Hospital Abuja, said most listed drugs are not in use in Nigeria. He also revealed that the recommended combination for the treatment of malaria is artemisinin and lumefantrin, Artesunate and amodiaquine, Artesunate and mefloquine and Artesunate and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. We dont really use most of these in Nigeria. What is recommended is artemisinin and lumefantrin, Artesunate+ amodiaquine, Artesunate +mefloquine and Artesunate+ sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. Our findings show this message is from a news story that trended in 2017, and most of the listed drugs are not in use in Nigeria. Experts note that the drugs in use in Nigeria align with the WHO recommendations, which do not include the listed drugs.",0
"The International Fact-checking Network (IFCN) has listed steps and strategies for fact-checking organisations to navigate conflict and government repression. This came in response to distress calls from various regions, including Congo and Afghanistan, regarding the challenges fact-checking establishments face. In a statement on Feb. 7, 2024, by Angie Holan, the IFCNs director shared insights into the organisations response and offered guidance to address these concerns. Acknowledging the critical role of fact-checkers amidst active conflicts or government repression, the organisation are developing best practices to navigate such challenging situations. The IFCN staff has been developing advice on best practices for signatories in difficult situations such as active conflict or government repression while acknowledging the IFCNs limitations. We stand ready to connect fact-checkers with Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists ; these organisations have more experience and resources to help journalists on the ground, Ms Holan said. In light of the evolving landscape of digital threats, the IFCN has outlined essential steps for ensuring secure communication among fact-checking teams. These measures include using platforms with robust security features like Signal, Telegram, and Proton Mail, which offer end-to-end encryption to safeguard sensitive information. Moreover, implementing two-factor authentication across electronic devices and utilizing Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) were recommended to bolster cybersecurity defences and mitigate risks associated with data breaches and online surveillance. The fact-checking network also advises organisations under pressure to develop safety checklists and emergency preparedness plans. Essential items suggested for inclusion in such plans encompass multiple forms of identification, emergency currency, provisions for sustenance, medical supplies, portable charging devices, and extra clothing. In a show of solidarity, Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists have offered additional resources to address the concerns of fact-checking organisations navigating challenging environments. Ms Holan, on behalf of the IFCN, extends gratitude to those who have reached out for assistance and encourages continued communication to ensure ongoing support. The organisation remains committed to providing aid and is open to scheduling virtual meetings to address specific needs and challenges fact-checkers face worldwide. These are all important items to have in case of emergency. Please read the CPJ Security Guide for more details. Please keep us updated on your situation. We are happy to schedule a Zoom call if that is helpful, she said.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claims Fulani men attacked an 18-seater bus conveying Igbos returning to the East. Verdict: Misleading! Evidence gathered by DUBAWA shows that the images have been online since 2020 and 2023, long before the mob incident in Edo State. Moreover, no media outlet has reported a reprisal attack on the Igbo since the Edo lynching incident. On Friday, March 28, 2025, 16 persons alleged to have been kidnappers and Hausa herdsmen were lynched to death in the Uromi community in the Southern State of Edo. According to reports, the individuals were en route to Kano and travelling in a commercial truck when local security stopped them. Upon searching the travellers, they uncovered guns, which riled a rather irate mob to round them up and take the law into their hands. The incident occurred a few days before the Eid El Fitr celebrations. Amidst concerns of a reprisal attack, a Facebook user, Elder Zegeorkwande , on Sunday, Mar. 30, 2025, shared three images of a burnt vehicle and claimed Fulani men attacked an 18-seater bus conveying Igbo passengers in Kano State back to the East. The Facebook user with over 43,000 followers shared images of a charred bus with the caption; AGGRESSIVE RETALIATION: BREAKING An 18-seater bus carrying Igbo passengers was set on fre in Kano. Panic has spread across the Igbo community in the state as Fulani men go on a rampage, attcking and killing any Igbo they come across in retaliation for the killing carried out by Edo hunters. Tragically, 18 Igbos lost their lives this morning while travelling back to the East. A violent Fulani mob ambushed their bus, set it ablaze, and left no survivors, he further wrote. As of Monday, March 31, 2025, the post had accumulated about 357 reactions, 245 comments, and 23 shares. In the comment section, some users who believed the incident to be true anticipated such an attack, while others dismissed it as false. This scenario came to my mind the moment I came across that video yesterday. May their souls rest in peace. Bearing the consequences of other peoples actions, Orinya Emma wrote. Another user, Sewuese Orkuma , said, This is not a good sign at all. And if care is not taken, this will not end soon. Strongly doubting the post, Elazar Ichenna wrote, Old man like you follow dey report fake news and I think say u legit self. Meanwhile, similar claims were shared here , here , here , here , and here . The contradicting comments and the possibility of a tribal conflict in the country, given the strained relationships between the tribes involved, made DUBAWA investigate the claim. DUBAWA subjected the three pictures shared by the users to a Google Reverse Image Search to know their respective contexts. When we analysed the first image, we came across a report that Punch newspaper published on Sept. 30, 2023. The news outlet reported an auto accident that involved a Toyota Hiace that got burnt, although its passengers had escaped unhurt. DUBAWA noticed that the charred bus the claimant shared on Facebook was the exact vehicle in Punchs report about an inferno in 2023. We also found a video on Facebook that Punch posted on Sept. 30, 2023, showing a complete view of the vehicle involved in the accident. It bears a striking resemblance to the picture the claimant shared. Punch also shared the clip on its Instagram page. We conducted a Google Reverse Image Search on the second image and found a report Punch published on Jan. 17, 2020. The news outlet narrated how a commercial bus conveying 19 passengers exploded in Ijebu-Ife on the Ore-Ijebu Ode-Sagamu Road in Ogun State. DUBAWA noticed that Punch had included a picture of the commercial bus in the 2020 report, which is the burnt vehicle the Facebook claimant shared. Channels also reported the same story on Jan. 16, 2020, and included similar images. DUBAWA noticed that the third image shared by the Facebook claimant is the same as the first. Furthermore, we checked for any report of an alleged reprisal attack on Igbos following the recent event but discovered that no reputable media outlet reported such an incident. The claim is false. There are no reports of a reprisal attack on Igbos as a result of the lynching in Uromi. The pictures used to portray the claim are old and unrelated.",1
"Claim : Nigeria is the only OPEC country, apart from Venezuela, that could not meet its oil quota. Verdict : False! While Nigeria could not meet up with its oil quota, there are other countries that are also unable to meet the OPEC benchmark. The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, and his running mate, Datti Baba-Ahmed, on January 8 appeared on Channels Television Town Hall meeting to discuss their action plan for Nigerians if elected. During the session, the LP flag-bearers were given the opportunity to answer questions from many Nigerians across the country. Mr Obi spoke on different aspects of the economy that need improvement and what his government will do differently. He also spoke on the issue of security, power and other sectors. While addressing the issue of oil theft in Nigeria, Obi said the country had not been able to meet the oil production quota set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Nigeria is said to have lost about N1.3 trillion to oil theft between January and August 2022, according to the ad-hoc committee set up by the Senate to investigate oil theft. Meanwhile, there have been a lot of clampdowns on oil thieves and vandals in recent times. Oil, which ordinarily is your (Nigerias) main source of foreign exchange income, is now being stolen. You (Nigeria) are the only OPEC country apart from Venezuela that could not meet your quota because people in government are stealing the oil, Obi had said while answering a question on measures to be adopted to help the country with a stable exchange rate. But is this true? Nigeria became a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1971 and has been described as the most populous country within OPEC. The oil quota for Nigeria set by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 1.8 million barrels per day (BPD) from November 2022 to December 2023. However, the country could not meet its oil production quota for November 2022, according to data by OPEC. The countrys oil quota for the month stood at 1.18 million (OPEC crude oil production based on direct communication, tb/d million BPD). The figures were contained in the organisations Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) released in December 2022. Meanwhile, Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC) noted that Nigerias crude oil production increased to 1.23 million BPD in December 2022, according to its crude oil and condensate production data for the month. In its January 2023 MOMR , OPEC also confirmed that the country experienced 50 month-to-month change from 1.18 million BPD in November 2022 to 1.23 million BPD in December 2022. Despite the increase, Nigeria still falls short of its 1.8 million BPD quota set by OPEC. Further checks, however, showed that Nigeria is not the only OPEC country that could not meet its daily oil quota in the listed period. The figures revealed that Angola, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Iran, among others, also fell short of their required oil quota. OPEC data show that Ang ola produced 1.08 million BPD against the set quota of 1.5 million BPD; Saudi Arabia fell short of its 11.4 million BPD target to produce only 10.4 million BPD in the same month, while the UAE produced 3.043 million BPD against the set 3.17 million BPD. Similarly, Iraq produced 4.4 million BPD against the set 4.6 million BPD. Findings show the organisation had no oil quota for Venezuela in its 2022 MOMR. It only noted that the country produced 693,000 BPD in November 2022 and 669,000 BPD in December 2022. Despite its large oi l reserves, Venezuela has failed to meet the OPEC oil quota, partly due to its political and economic crisis. The claim that Nigeria and Venezuela are the only countries that could not meet their oil production quota set by OPEC is false. There are other countries that could not meet their targets.",1
"Claim: The bacteria in yoghurt is the same as the one in the vagina. Verdict: FALSE. Although the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina may have some similarities, they are different. Yoghurt, the creamy and tangy dairy delight, has been a staple in cuisines worldwide for centuries. Whether its enjoyed on its own, as a savoury dip, or as a refreshing topping for your favourite fruits and granola, yoghurt is a versatile and nutritious food that has something for everyone. Yoghurt is made by fermenting milk with live cultures of bacteria packed with probiotics that promote healthy digestion and boost the immune system. Its also a great source of protein, calcium, and other essential vitamins and minerals. People often wonder about two common types of bacteria found in yoghurt and those in the vagina. While both types of bacteria are important, are they the same? Recently on Twitter, in a post , temmie (@me_lanin_pie) asserted that the bacteria found in the vagina is the same in Yoghurt. The tweet reads, The bacteria found in yoghurt is the same bacteria found in the vagina. As of the time of filing this report, the tweet had a combination of retweets, likes, comments and views of over 742,000 engagements. DUBAWA thought it important to verify this because of the conflicting views about the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina, its virality and the sensitive nature of the issue concerning public health. According to an Oxford University Press on National Library publication , the word yoghourt is believed to have come from the Turkish word yourmak, which means to thicken, coagulate, or curdle. During references to the health-promoting properties of yoghurt date back to 6000 BC in Indian Ayurvedic scripts, it was not until the 20th century that Stamen Grigorov, a Bulgarian medical student, attributed the benefits to lactic acid bacteria. Bacteria play an essential role in our bodies, and we encounter different types of bacteria in various parts of our bodies. Medical News Today defines bacteria as microscopic, single-celled organisms that exist in their millions, in every environment, both inside and outside other organisms. Some bacteria are harmful, but most serve a useful purpose. They support many forms of life, both plant and animal and are used in industrial and medicinal processes. Yoghurt is a fermented milk product made by adding specific strains of bacteria to milk. It is made when heated milk is combined with bacteria and left to sit at a warm temperature for several hours. According to Simon Pedersen, a Food Scientist at Arla Foods, When we add bacteria to milk products, we refer to them as cultures and use those with a good reputation. They are called lactic acid bacteria or lactic acid cultures. These bacteria convert the lactose in milk into lactic acid, which causes the milk to thicken and develop its characteristic tangy taste. The two most common species of lactic acid bacteria used in yoghurt production are Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilous. On the other hand, the vagina contains a complex microbiome of different types of bacteria. The most dominant type of bacteria in a healthy vagina is the Lactobacillus species. These bacteria help maintain the vaginal pH, preventing the overgrowth of harmful bacteria that can lead to infections. The specific species of Lactobacillus present in the vagina include Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus iners, and Lactobacillus gasseri, among others. In 2015 , Cecilia Westbrook, an MD/PhD student at the University of Wisconsin, made yoghurt using her vaginal bacteria. Rosanne Hertzberger, a Dutch microbiologist who studies vaginal bacteria at Washington University School of Medicine in the US, told ScienceAlert this was apparently not a good idea because our vaginas contain many of bad, as well as good, bacteria. The dominant bacteria in the vagina is Lactobacillus, similar to the bacteria used to make yoghurt. However, not all Lactobacillus strains can create yoghurt, and the yoghurt we buy at supermarkets is made from a combination of different bacterial strains. Ms Hertzberger replicated an experiment to make yoghurt using different Lactobacillus strains, but only one was remotely successful, producing sour milk with precipitated milk protein. Gregor Reid, a professor of microbiology at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, also disagrees with the experiment by Ms Westbrook. According to Mr Reid, it is improbable that the experiment conducted by the woman resulted in any health benefits. He said, if she was eating it to get the benefits of the lactobacillus, she already has plenty in her vagina, so that makes no sense. The bacteria used in yoghurt production are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture. According to a publication on Science Direct , the bacteria in the vagina are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining the vaginal environment. One of the most significant differences between the bacteria in yoghurt and the vagina is their location. Yoghurt bacteria are primarily found in the digestive system, whereas vaginal bacteria are found in the reproductive system. Additionally, yoghurt bacteria are not a natural body part, whereas vaginal bacteria are. Another important difference is the role they play in the body. While yoghurt bacteria can help promote digestive health, vaginal bacteria are essential for reproductive health. A health expert, Omale Ogbe, in an interview with DUBAWA, stated that the bacterias are not the same based on the taxonomy . They may be of the same genus, but they are not the same specie as can be seen here for bacteria found in the vagina (Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus. jensenii, and Lactobacillus gasser) and here for yoghurt bacteria (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), Mr Ogbe explained. While the bacteria found in yoghurt and the vagina may have some similarities, they are not the same. Yoghurt bacteria are selected for their ability to ferment milk and create a specific taste and texture, while vaginal bacteria are naturally occurring and play a vital role in maintaining reproductive health. The researcher produced this fact-check per the DUBAWA 2023 Kwame KariKari Fellowship partnership with BONews to facilitate the ethos of truth in journalism and enhance media literacy in the country.",0
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is recruiting. Our findings show theres no ongoing recruitment by NERC and the recruitment portal linked in this message is not trustworthy. Recruitment and job offers continue to be exploited by misinformation peddlers to defraud, harm or steal information. Recently, a viral WhatsApp message which claims the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is conducting a recruitment exercise was sent to DUBAWA for verification. This message contained a link described as the recruitment portal for the commissions 2022 recruitment exercise. DUBAWA first opened the link contained in the WhatsApp message as this led to a website, recriutment.online . The wrong spelling of recruitment as recruitment in the website address was the first red flag. We followed the registration process, which was divided into three phases. The first phase requires applicants to enter details like their name, phone number, age, educational level and state of origin. The second phase requires applicants to answer a few questions, while the final phase tasks applicants to invite friends and family before their recruitment form is available. This is a practice common with fraudulent websites. We conducted a keyword search which led to a disclaimer notice by the commission on similar false recruitment adverts that have been in circulation. These adverts, according to the disclaimer, request employment processing fees. We also found out that while it is true, the commission had earlier in June put out a recruitment notice on its Twitter account , this exercise expired on July 15, 2022. The portal address used for this recruitment was careers.nerc.gov.ng , different from the one provided in this message. image of the recruitment notice. We visited the recruitment website provided by the commission and saw a notice on the welcome page that its 2022 recruitment exercise is closed. We then analysed the link contained in this WhatsApp message on ScamAdviser, a reliable online tool that dictates scams and rates the trustworthiness of websites. This showed several indicators that the website may be a scam, giving the site a trust score of 1/100. Our findings show theres no ongoing recruitment by NERC. The recruitment portal linked in this WhatsApp message is not trustworthy and is different from that of the commission.",1
"Claim: An X user claimed Kasim Primary School in the Agaie LGA of Niger State had been shut down and teachers arrested over a pupils debate video that went viral in February 2024. The claim also appeared on Facebook . Verdict: False! While the Niger State Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education initially stated that it would investigate the issue, the Ministrys spokesperson later clarified to DUBAWA that the school was not shut down as alleged. The current economic realities and other challenges in Nigeria have forced some Nigerians to call for a nationwide protest to create more awareness about the hardship facing the citizens and demand a solution from the government. The National Bureau of Statistics recently issued data showing that Nigerias inflation rate in June 2024 increased to 34.19%. Unhappy with the situation, Nigerians have taken to X (formerly Twitter) to trend hashtags to mobilise for the protest, which is scheduled to start on August 1. The hashtags include EndBadGovernance and Tinubu Must Go. The proposed demonstration in Nigeria is coming weeks after a similar protest in Kenya which shook the countrys political landscape. DUBAWA observed that to justify the forthcoming protest in Nigeria, many supporting it have shared various claims to show the perceived issues with the Nigerian citizens. Recently, one of them, @CrownprinceCom2 , an X user with over 50,000 followers, claimed a school Kasim Primary School was shut down in Agaie local government area of Niger State by the Department of State Services (DSS). The X user also alleged that all teachers of the school were arrested by the security agency in the process, claiming the action further highlights the need for the proposed protest to end bad governance in Nigeria. DUBAWA observed comments under the post, which shows that some people believed the claim while others doubted its authenticity, as seen here , here, and here . The video was also shared with the same narrative on Facebook as seen here and here . Recall that in February 2024, a video went viral on social media showing a pupil of Kasim Primary School who introduced himself as AbdulKabir AbdulKadir expressing anger over the nations state. During a debate organised by the school, the boy argued against the motion advocating for mandatory voting in Nigeria. Buttressing his point, the vocal pupil said the masses voted for President Bola Tinubu last year to make things better but lamented that the president threw the country into hardship by removing the petroleum subsidy. He further called on thunder to strike and eliminate all the leaders so that peace could reign in the country. His submission in the video attracted various reactions on social media. While some users supported the boy, others condemned his use of certain vulgar words. Reacting at the time , Niger State Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education frowned upon the choice of words by the pupil, arguing that it is against the values of respect and decorum that should be upheld in educational settings. The ministry also noted that disciplinary actions would be taken against the school management, and further investigations would be carried out. An official at the ministry also confirmed to TheCable that the class teacher and headmaster were invited for cautioning by the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB). They were invited to be cautioned against teaching children violent language. The teachers and students were invited by SUBEB just to caution them to desist from such acts as the pupil is a minor. He shouldnt be saying that, the official said. But was the school shut down and teachers arrested, as claimed by the X user? To ascertain the veracity of the claim, DUBAWA contacted Jibrin Usman Kodo, who is the spokesperson of the Niger State Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education. He confirmed to DUBAWA that the school was not shut down, stating that the claim was ridiculous. He said: That is fake news. Why will a school be shut down because of one pupil? Thats not possible. No sane thinking person will believe that. When asked if any disciplinary action was taken, as stated in earlier reports, Mr Kodo explained that the ministrys initial statement was just to dissuade other schools from permitting vulgar language in their debates. He said no one was punished for the incident. We just stated that to serve as a warning to other schools, so it wont repeat itself, he told DUBAWA. To further confirm the true state of things, DUBAWA contacted Suleiman Mohammed Baba, a resident of Efu Sankuchi, Ekowugi ward in Agaie LGA, who is familiar with the school. Mr Baba said the school was not shut down, and the teachers were not arrested. He further noted that the boy captured in the viral video is also doing well. The resident also told DUBAWA that the school plans to hold its graduation party. From time to time, people have been spreading rumours that the school has been closed and teachers sacked, but Im telling you, there is nothing like that. The boy is fine, and the school is even planning to have its send-forth party very soon. There is no problem at all, he said. The claim that DSS operatives arrested teachers of Kashim Primary School in the Agaie LG of Niger State and shut the school over a debate video is false.",0
"Claim: IT student who cleared the debts of MTN subscribers has been arrested. Verdict: FALSE. The image used to portray the alleged IT student who cleared the debts of MTN subscribers is that of a Nigerian man charged with murder in London in 2014. Also, according to the Punch report, the debt cancellation was a system glitch. In Nov. 2023, subscribers of the Mobile Telephone Network (MTN) service provider widely celebrated a cancellation of their debt on the mobile networks package, XtraTime . XtraTime allows subscribers to borrow airtime if their airtime has been exhausted. On Saturday, Dec. 11, 2023, a Facebook user, Update King , announced that an Industrial Training (IT) student, who allegedly cleared the debts of MTN subscribers over airtime borrowing, has been arrested by the Nigerian Police Force (NPF). The IT student who cleared all MTN users debt last month has been arrested. The Facebook user announced. Along with the text was an attached photo of a man in his twenties, accosted by two police officers. The post has since garnered 89 likes, 54 comments, and 102 shares as of Monday, Dec. 11, 2023. A majority of those who commented clamoured for the mans release. Make una free this guy jare. Dar Ling commented . This means the man in question should be freed. Please let him be free. Uquaa Edison also clamoured . The post has since gone viral across notable social media, including Facebook , X (formerly Twitter), and TikTok . Due to the sensitivity and virality of the claim, DUBAWA decided to verify it. We conducted a keyword search on Google related to the arrest but found no reliable report. However, we came across a news report published by Punch newspaper on Nov. 11, 2023. In the report , MTN acknowledged the situation and described it as a system error. The network provider clarified that the incident was caused by an unexpected glitch. However, the debt status of the defaulting subscribers remained valid. We also used Google Reverse Image Search to analyse the picture, and it linked us with a news report published by Premium Times. In the story , we found out that the image originally depicts a Nigerian man, identified as 23-year-old Jefferey Okafor, who was deported from London in 2014 for a murder trial. Mr Okafor had fled London for Nigeria after he was found to have been connected with the murder of 19-year-old Carl Asiedu, a disc jockey, in Aug. 2009. However, in 2014, the Nigerian police discovered Mr Okafor in Asaba, the capital of Delta State, and prepared to extradite him to London for possible prosecution. DUBAWAs contact with MTN and the NPF via emails yielded no response. The image used to portray the alleged IT student who cleared the debts of MTN subscribers is that of a man charged with murder in London in 2014. MTN also told Punch that the cancellation was due to a system glitch.",0
"A photo has been posted on Facebook in Nigeria in October 2022 with the claim it shows Lagdo Dam in Cameroon. The caption starts : Here is the Lagdo Dam in Cameroon Causing Annual Flooding in Nigeria. Lagdo Dam is a hydroelectric dam built in 1977 and is located in the North region of Cameroon . Cameroon borders Nigeria to the west. Local news media reported earlier in the year that the National Emergency Management Agency , or Nema, had predicted 32 out of Nigerias 36 states, including the Federal Capital Territory , would experience flooding in 2022. Nema is the agency in Nigeria responsible for managing disasters and related issues. It has been widely reported in both local and international media that excess water released from the Lagdo Dam contributed to flooding in some parts of Nigeria in 2022, leading to loss of life and damage to properties. But in October, a news organisation reported that Nigerias water minister Suleiman Adamu said Lagdo Dam contributes only one percent to the flooding in Nigeria, even though sometimes the water is released without notice. The same photo and claim about Lagdo Dam were also shared on Facebook here and here . But is this a photo of Lagdo Dam? We checked. A reverse image search of the photo led us to a post on Wikipedia Commons , which in turn led us to a March 2009 post on Flickr by photographer Dustin Moore . Here the photo is identified as showing Fort Gibson Dam in Oklahoma, United States. The photo circulating on Nigerian social media doesnt show Lagdo Dam and was not taken in Cameroon.",0
"If you have money in any Nigerian banks, please use it for an investment, because it's not safe. This is the claim in a Facebook post published in January 2024. The same claim appeared on the platform here , here , here and here . The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been in the headlines for months. In June 2023, president Bola Tinubu suspended its governor, Godwin Emefiele . In August, Emefiele was arrested and charged with procurement fraud . He was released on bail. According to media reports in December, Jim Obazee, a special investigator probing the central bank, reported to Tinubu that Emefiele had acquired some commercial banks with ill-gotten wealth. Nigeria's central bank removed the board members of the affected banks in early January 2024 and appointed new ones . But is there any credence to the claim about deposits? On 27 December 2023, the central bank sought to reassure customers of the affected banks through a statement on its social media handles. The banking regulator urged individuals to continue doing business without hesitation, saying Nigerian banks remain safe and sound. In a separate statement on 10 January 2024, it said: The CBN assures the public of the safety and security of depositors funds Our Banking system remains strong and resilient. The central bank added that it was committed to maintaining a sound and robust financial system.",0
"With only a few weeks to the end of his tenure, President Muhammadu Buhari and his team have continued to reel out what they considered as major achievements of the government while efforts are on to ramp up some initiatives before leaving office. On April 26, 2023, the Federal Executive Council (FEC) anno unced the approval of an Action Plan 2022 to 2026 to promote and protect human rights in Nigeria. Speaking at the event, the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said the approval followed Mr Buhari administrations compliance with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) judgement and payment of N135 million compensation to victims and family members of the September 18, 2013, Apo-six killings. As you will recall, the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari has established a record of being the first and only administration in the history of Nigeria that has indeed tolerated, accommodated and enforced the decision of the Human Rights Commission, the minister said . The minister, citing a report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said Nigeria is the only African country in 2022 that has been in full compliance in terms of the protection of the rights of journalists. He further claimed that no journalist had died in Nigeria under the Buhari-led administration due to infractions relating to their work. You are equally aware that the committee for the protection of journalists, which is an international committee, had equally adjudged Nigeria as the only African country last year that has been in full compliance in terms of the protection of the rights of the journalist taking into consideration that not a single incidence of death of a journalist has been recorded in Nigeria arising from infractions, relating thereto. His statement came amid allegations of human rights infractions against the Nigerian government and censorship against the press in the country. Claim 1: Mr Malami said Nigeria is the only African country in 2022 that has been fully compliant with the protection of journalists based on a CPJ report. In a statement on Friday, the CPJ debunked Mr Malamis claim, noting that the minister misinterpreted its report to drive home his position. CPJs Africa program coordinator, Angela Quintal, condemned the Ministers statement saying, CPJs research on press freedom in Nigeria, showing years of attacks on press members including killings strongly contradicts comments by Attorney General and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami about the press freedom situation in the country. Malamis misrepresentation of CPJ research is particularly alarming and tragically ironic given how frequently Nigerian journalists are accused and prosecuted for distributing alleged falsehoods. The organisation also said the minister had repeatedly misquoted its data to mean Nigeria was doing well in protecting journalists. Data from the Press Attack Tracker also corroborated that journalists in the country have suffered assaults. The tool, initiated by the Centre for Journalism, Innovation and Development (CJID), showed that 52 journalists were victims of an attack in 2022, with state actors accounting for most of these attacks. It further revealed that in the last four years (2019-2022), 179 journalists have been attacked in Nigeria. These attacks are mainly perpetrated by state actors and security agencies, as seen in the chart below. These attacks range from physical assault, unlawful arrest, imprisonment, threats, surveillance, denial of access, Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPPs), equipment seizure/ damage, and even death. In the same year, Reporters Without Borders ranked Nigeria 129/180 in its chart on the safety of journalists. Nigeria is one of West Africas most dangerous and difficult countries for journalists, who are often watched, attacked, arbitrarily arrested and even killed, the report added. The Nigerian government has faced criticisms bordering on policies perceived to undermine the safety and freedom of journalists in the country. Such repressive laws include the Cybercrime Act 2015 , the Defamation Act , the Anti-Terrorism Act, the NBC code, and the NITDA acts. These laws are consistently used to deal with media organisations and journalists. These laws are inconsistent with international standards and have been widely criticised by human rights organisations. For example, the ECOWAS Court ruled that Section 24 of the Cybercrime Act is arbitrary, unlawful, and requires amendment. The suit was brought by Socio-Economic Rights And Accountability Project (SERAP), and it stated that 12 cases of alleged victims of harassment, intimidation, arrest, unlawful detention, prosecution, and imprisonment of journalists and broadcasters across several states of Nigeria between August 2015 and November 2018 had been recorded. However, the judgement of the ECOWAS proceedings has not been implemented, which goes against the claim that Nigeria has been compliant with the principles guarding the safety of journalists. We tried contacting Mr Malami to ask for a specific CPJ report he referred to, but our calls and text messages were not replied to. Moreover, in the first quarter of 2023, being an election season, preliminary findings by PTA show at least 45 journalists were attacked, with physical attacks accounting for most cases recorded. Verdict: False. According to data from the Press Attack Tracker, 52 journalists were attacked in Nigeria in 2022. Also, Mr Malamis reference to the CPJ report was used in a misleading context. Claim 2: Not a single incidence of death of a journalist has been recorded in Nigeria arising from infractions, relating thereto Mr Malami. A 2021 report released by the Media Foundation for West Africa (MFWA) in collaboration with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) stated that eight journalists had been killed under Mr Buharis administration. However, not all eight died during the discharge of their duty as journalists. The report reads, For example, in 2017, four journalists were killed in separate incidents with no credible inquiry yet to find the culprits and their motive for the fatal attacks. The four were a cameraman with the Anambra Broadcasting Services, Ikechukwu Onubogu; Lawrence Okojie of the Nigeria Television Authority in Edo State, a Desk Editor with Glory FM in Bayelsa State, Famous Giobaro and freelance broadcaster in Ekiti State, Abdul Ganiyu Lawal. Four more journalists have since been killed under circumstances that have yet to be clarified through credible investigations. The killing on July 22, 2019, of Precious Owolabi, a reporter with the Channels Television in Abuja while covering a protest by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria-IMN, was agonising. Mr Owolabis death had occurred while discharging his duties. Alex Ogbu, an editor with the local independent outlet Regent Africa Times, suffered the same fate when he was killed at a protest in Abuja on January 21, 2020. All these happened during the President Buhari administration. Meanwhile, data from the Press Attack Tracker showed that 610 journalists had been attacked in Nigeria from 1985 to date. Of this figure, 21 journalists have been killed in the country. The first recorded case was that of Dele Giwa. Plights of some families of the slain journalists can be found in this report . Verdict: The claim that no journalist has been killed in the line of duty under the Buhari administration is false. At least two cases were documented within the eight years of the regime. Mr Malamis claim that Nigeria is the only African country fully compliant with the protection of journalists in 2022 and that no journalist in the country has died from work-related infractions is false. The Press Attack Tracker and other media reports showed journalists are still endangered in the country.",1
"With the financial difficulties citizens of West African countries grappled with in 2023, the traditional and new media were awash with information regarding their nations economy. Below are some of the claims DUBAWA fact-checked in 2023. In Feb. 2023, a statement purported to have come from the apex bank circulated on social media announcing the reissue and recirculation of the old N500 and N1,000 notes till May 1, 2023. Nigerias former first lady, Aisha Buhari, shared the false statement on her official social media handles, and the Central Bank of Nigeria debunked it. Similarly, during his swearing-in ceremony, Nigerias president, Bola Tinubu, promised to unify the countrys multiple exchange rates. A few weeks later, the CBN reportedly directed Deposit Money Banks to remove the rate cap on the naira at the Investors and Exporters (I&E) Window of the foreign exchange market. CBNs directive allows a free national currency to float against the dollar and other global currencies. Subsequently, a press release from the CBN circulated on social media claiming the CBN had addressed policy action on foreign exchange. However, checks by DUBAWA revealed that the statement was from 2017. Amid complaints about the high cost of taxation for travellers using the Lungi International Airport, a report had gone viral claiming that the Sierra Leone government added $165 extra taxes for passengers travelling by air into the country. This elicited more groanings from residents, particularly members of the Hospitality Association, who raised concerns about how this could adversely affect their industry. DUBAWA came across a press release from the Ministry of Information and Civic Education, which described the information as fake and misleading. Also, DUBAWA contacted some travellers who explained that they were only charged a $25 security fee with no extra tax. In 2023, many false and misleading claims were circulated surrounding the existence of Opay, Palmpay, and Kuda, among others. In February, a viral post on X claimed that the Central Bank of Nigeria had ordered the closure of Opay, Palmpay and Kuda. The allegation caused panic. DUBAWA investigated it and found it to be false. In Oct. 2023, a video also went viral on social media claiming Opay agents protested missing funds. The footage was accompanied by a caption urging users to transfer their funds to an alternative account. However, checks by DUBAWA showed that the video was used in a misleading context as it was from a 2021 incident. Also, in Dec. 2023, another allegation went viral on social media, stating that Opay, Palmpay, and Kuda were among the financial institutions to be taken down. Again, it turned out to be false. A member of the New Patriotic Party, Nana Akomea, claimed that Ghanas economic growth rate was the highest in Africa between 2017 and 2019. He said the country would have been in a better economic situation than it is experiencing currently but had been adversely affected by COVID-19. Data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Bank of Ghana and World Bank showed that Ghana recorded a growth rate of 8.1% in the administrations first year. This reduced to 6.2% in 2018 before a marginal rise to 6.5% in 2019. In 2017, three African countries, Ethiopia, Guinea, and Libya, recorded a higher growth rate than Ghanas in 2017. The growth rate of Burkina Faso and Rwandas economies was higher than that of Ghana in 2018 and the same in 2019, rendering the claim false. One of the major highlights of the year 2023 was the election in Nigeria. To gain support for themselves or their preferred candidates, some Nigerian politicians made allegations surrounding the countrys inflation rate to mislead people. Former president Muhammadu Buhari had blamed COVID-19 majorly for the rising inflation rate in the country. He also said other countries experienced a similar situation. However, our investigations showed that while there was an increase in the inflation rate of other countries, other factors apart from COVID-19 were responsible. In a related development, current Minister of Aviation and Aerospace Development, Festus Keyamo, alleged Nigeria had the highest inflation rate under the Obasanjo-Atiku administration, not under former President Muhammadu Buhari. However, findings by DUBAWA showed that Nigeria experienced the highest inflation rate in 1995 at a critical mark of 72.84%, while Olusegun Obasanjos tenure started in 1999, four years later. Also, former Kwara state governor Bukola Saraki stated that the inflation rate remained at a single digit under the Peoples Democratic Party. However, DUBAWAs findings showed that during the PDP rule from 1999 to 2015, the countrys inflation rate fluctuated between 6.6 in 1999, 18.9 in 2001, 23.8 in 2003, and 15.1 in 2008. The Assistant Minister for Planning at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning (MFDP) under the previous administration, Benedict Kolubah, claimed that the Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC) took over the country from the Unity party at a point when Public Sector investment was US$ 27 million. DUBAWA visited the official website of the Ministry of Finance for information on the public sector investment under the previous Sirleaf-Johnson administration compared to that of the first year of the CDC administration. Meanwhile, former President George Weah became president in 2018. According to the last budget, 2017/2018, under the previous administration headed by Ms Sirleaf, public sector investment for the fiscal year 2016/2017 was at US$62,398,129 and 2017/18 was at 55,280,850, contrary to what the Assistant Minister claimed. This showed that the information given by the Assistant Minister was false. President Bola Tinubu claimed that Lagos State is the fifth largest economy in Africa. On the contrary, DUBAWAs findings showed that while Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa with a $440 billion GDP, Lagos state ranked 12th with a GDP of $59.7 million, making the claim false. Similarly, former minister of finance, Zainab Ahmed, claimed that the countrys 7.5% VAT rate is the lowest in the world. However, DUBAWA found that at least three countries Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Oman, have VAT rates lower than the 7.5% in Nigeria as of 2023.",1
"Misinformation spreads online and offline daily, showing the need for Media and Information Literacy and verification. Here are some claims fact-checked by DUBAWA in the past week. A wildfire disaster occurred on the Liberian Capitol Building on Dec. 18, 2024, causing damage to the Legislature of $1.8 million. Bryan Harris, a social media user, posted in Liberian Policy Forum, a Facebook group, alleging that the FRA findings revealed the Capitol Building Disaster was caused by electric shock and natural causes. DUBAWA analysed the FRA investigative report on the fire, which identified the Speakers podium as the origin. The rapid spread suggested the use of an ignitable liquid. The fire was ruled intentional, as electrical causes were eliminated, and suspicious one-gallon containers were found near exits. A Facebook handle, Nigerian NewsHeadlines Today, claimed that Galatasarays head coach, Okan Buruk, slammed Conte over Osimhens contract with Galatasaray. The former player-turned-coach fumed at Conte for desiring to have the one-time African player of the year back at Napoli. When we checked , we saw no evidence that Galatasarays head coach made the alleged statements. Earlier this week, a Facebook user shared a video showing several people scampering for free bread, claiming it was in Ogun State, Nigeria. However, DUBAWA investigated and found that the video was out of context. Although the incident did happen, the timing and location are misleading. The minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Nyesom Wike, ordered a demolition to clear space for a road linking Maitama District and Gwarimpa. Following this demolition, several claims have emerged offline and on Facebook, including claims that the entire Gishiri community was demolished and the people of the Gbagyi tribe were the main targets, amongst others. Following DUBAWAs visit to the Gishiri community and other investigations, we found some of the claims were true, while others were false and misleading. A Facebook user alleged that the Bong County Council approved US$100,000 for cultivating beans across the county. DUBAWAs investigation revealed that $100,000 was not approved for bean cultivation across Bong. According to the Bong County Council Chairperson, Aaron Sackie Fenlah, and a copy of the approved hundred-day deliverable budget, only $1,900 was allotted for the countys beans project.",1
"Claim: A viral WhatsApp message claims the Italian Ministry of Health has discovered that COIVD-19 is not a virus but a bacteria among several other claims. Most of the claims were found to be false. Italy recorded its first two cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) at the end of January 2020 but as of January 7, 2021, Italy had recorded roughly 2.2 million cases of the virus with 571, 055 active cases. A viral WhatsApp message claims that the Italian Ministry of Health has discovered Coronavirus (COVID-19) to be a bacterium reacting to the 5G radiation not a virus and that it can be treated with antibiotics. The message claims this was discovered when Italys Ministry of Health violated the World Health Organizations law against autopsies on COVID-19 victims. This bacterium is said to cause thrombosis i.e. blood clots in the veins and nerves which leads to death. Doctors in Italy have violated World Health Organization (WHO) law, which does not authorize autopsies (postmortem) on the bodies of people who have died from the coronavirus in order to find out after some kind of scientific discovery. It cannot be assumed that it is not a virus, but a bacterium that causes death, which causes blood clots to form in the veins, i.e. blood clots in the veins and nerves due to this bacterium and this is the patient cause of death. Excerpt of the Viral message. Dubawa conducted a keyword search on this claim which led to some fact checks done in 2020 by politifact , poynter etc. Dubawa also studied different documents on COVID-19 by WHO. Claim 1: COVID-19 a bacteria not a virus According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), COVID-19 is a virus that has an ecological origin in bats populations. Italys ministry of health also identified COVID-19 as a virus. Claim 2: They violated WHO law against autopsy The claim that Italy violated the WHO law against autopsy is false as there is no instruction or law by the WHO against autopsy on COVID-19 victims. Contrary to this, the WHO released a guideline for conducting an autopsy . Claim 3: Covid-19 causes thrombosis Thrombosis occurs when a thrombus, or blood clot , develops in a blood vessel and reduces the flow of blood through the vessel. The development of a thrombus is what is described as thrombosis. Studies have shown that thrombosis can occur in COVID-19 patients of different age groups. A study titled Incidence on thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19 shows that 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is high. Another study on Thrombotic Neurovascular disease in COVID-19 patients also suggests this. Claim 4: COVID-19 can be treated with antibiotics Since COVID-19 has been identified as a virus not a bacterium, antibiotics can not be used to treat it. This is supported by WHO which noted that the only reason you might receive antibiotics during a COVID-19 treatment is if there is a bacterial co-infection. Claim 5: COVID-19 is a bacteria reacting to the 5G radiation COVID-19 has no link with the 5G radiation as the WHO organisation has clearly stated that COVID-19 cannot be transmitted via waves/mobile networks and the virus has spread to countries that do not have 5G mobile networks. Claims in the viral WhatsApp message are false and misleading as none of the claims could be linked to Italys Ministry of Health. C0VID-19 has also been identified as a virus and there is no WHO law or guideline against autopsy. There is also no link between 5G and COVID-19, neither does antibiotics cure COVID-19.",0
"CLAIM: The President of Sierra Leone, Julius Maada Bio, has commissioned a brand New Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone. VERDICT: False! President Julius Maada Bio didnt commission a new airport but rather a new terminal. The Freetown International Airport has been a trending topic of discussion lately. This is owing to arguments around the newly commissioned facility in the Lungi airport by President Julius Maada Bio on Friday, March 3, 2023. While some say the facility is a brand new airport, others believe it is an extension of the existing one. Since the commissioning of the facility, some critics, including a Social Media Influencer, Joe Hanson , argued that the president commissioned a new terminal extension at the already existing Freetown International Airport, which contradicts the stand of supporters and government officials of the Sierra Leone Peoples Party hailing construction of a new airport. A member of the Strategic Communications Units at the Ministry of Information and Communications, Peter Beckley , also shared on a Facebook post that the new facility is an airport. He said in his post, I witnessed the opening of the new Ultra modern Airport on Friday, March 3, 2023, which was an experience close to hysteria. Given the controversy, this story has generated in Sierra Leone over the last couple of weeks and the need to set the records straight on the matter, DUBAWA decided to investigate the matter. DUBAWA sought to discover whether or not the edifice was a completely new one or an old one that had undergone a significant facelift. On Wednesday, December 16, 2020, the Parliament of Sierra Leone debated and ratified the Lungi Freetown International Airport expansion project agreement between the government of Sierra Leone and the Russian-owned Summa Airports Limited. In his statement while presenting the agreement in parliament prior to ratification, the Deputy Minister of Transport and Aviation, Sadiq Sillah, said that the Freetown International Airport project would focus mainly on the construction of a new passenger terminal that will cater for three million passengers, construction of a VIP/presidential lounge, resealing of the runway, construction of the taxiway, a new airport traffic terminal, search and rescue fire force unit, rehabilitation of the car park and road safety and its signs. On Thursday, November 12, 2020, the President, Dr Julius Maada Bio, turned the sod for what State House described as, the commencement of a $270 million work on the new airport terminal project that will accommodate one million passengers per year and provide 2000 direct jobs for Sierra Leoneans in the construction phase. The Country Director of the SUMMA Group in Sierra Leone, Ibrahim Sheriff , said, They were a multinational Turkish company operating in about eight African countries, adding that they are building a new terminal that would create the transformation of a new airport in Lungi. In his keynote address, while launching the project, Dr Julius Maada Bio said, They will build a brand new airport terminal, Presidential and VIP lounge with ultra-modern equipment. The airport, he said, would accommodate at least eight large aircraft, adding that after its completion, Sierra Leone will have a brand new airport a modern, safe, and state-of-the-art international airport reflective of the New Direction Government. Contrary to what some Sierra Leone Peoples Party party supporters and senior government ministers have been saying, President Bio, during the commissioning, cleared the air. He announced that the project is not a newly built airport, but a new passenger terminal : A new arrival and departure terminal built adjacent to the existing Lungi Freetown International Airport. This can be found on page six of his remarks at the Formal Commissioning of the New Freetown International Airport Terminal and Facilities on March 3, 2023. President Bio, in his statement, said that they had undertaken this investment because they believe it promotes job creation, boosts new growth sectors (tourism), supports international trade, and attracts new investment streams in other sectors. The president, on page number 6 of his statement , asked; So, what have we built? a. a new Passenger Terminal; b. a new Presidential and VIP terminal; c. a new Air Traffic Control Tower with ultramodern equipment, ICT infrastructure, and radiotelephony; d. a new parallel taxiway that connects to the existing runway, with connecting bridges; e. a new apron area that accommodates at least eight large aircraft; f. a new search and rescue and new firefighting facility; g. the resurfacing and refurbishment of the existing runway and the installation of new navigational aids and ground aids. h. A 1.5 MW solar farm that supplies green energy to the new airport facility. This is unique in the region. Further, a tweet shared by Mr Bio on his Twitter page also dispels the suppositions that the new infrastructure is a new airport. The president said, 04/03/2023 was a momentous day for our great nation #SierraLeone. As part of my SLPP Governments efforts to transform the infrastructural landscape, I opened the new state-of-the-art Freetown International Airport Terminal Building & supporting infrastructure in Lungi, Port Loko. President Julius Maada Bio, on Friday, March 3, 2023, didnt commission a brand new airport but a new terminal for the existing airport. The project since inception was to expand Lungi airport to include a new and larger terminal and relaying of the runway to accommodate larger and more airlines, in keeping with international standards.",0
"Biafra , in south-east Nigeria, is a region whose attempted secession in 1967 led to a 30-month civil war. When the war ended, the region was reintegrated into Nigeria. Calls for the restoration of Biafra continue. The Indigenous People of Biafra (Ipob), which agitates for Biafra's independence, is proscribed as a terrorist group by the Nigerian government. Its protests and sit-at-home orders in the eastern region have often disrupted daily life and heightened tensions. It is in this context that messages circulating on Facebook in Nigeria in December 2024 claim that 80 Nigerian soldiers were killed while clashing with pro-Biafran forces in Ohafia, Abia state, southern Nigeria. One of the posts begins : BREAKING: Heavy Gunfire in Ohafia as Biafra Forces Clash with Nigerian Soldiers. Heavy Sh00ting In Ohafia As Biafra Soldiers Clash With Nigerian Soldiers, 80 Nigerian Soldiers dead so far while Biafra are losing 3 of their soldiers, it claims . The post includes two photos: one of a wrecked army vehicle with two soldiers and another of an armoured tank in military camouflage. The same claim appeared on Facebook here and here . (Note: See other instances of the claim at the end of this report.) But did a clash between Nigerian soldiers and Biafra agitators result in 80 soldiers deaths? We checked. No evidence of a clash between Nigerian soldiers and Biafra agitators A Google reverse image search of the first photo revealed that it was posted by the Nigerian army on its official Facebook page in 2019. We traced the second photo to a 2014 column titled Nigerias armed forces and the crisis of insurgency, published by the local newspaper Vanguard. These photos do not show a recent clash between the Nigerian soldiers and pro-Biafran forces. A look through the Nigerian army website and social media handles returned no evidence of the claim. Also, local media closely covers Biafran conflicts, but no reports confirm a gunfight in Ohafia, with 80 Nigerian soldiers killed. The false claim also appeared here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here , here and here .",0
"To bolster the fight against misinformation globally, the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) at the Poynter Institute has announced the allocation of $1 million in grants to 20 deserving groups as part of the $12 million Global Fact Check Fund initiative, established with a generous grant from Google and YouTube. Poynter, a renowned global journalism institute, revealed the winners of the Funds second phase, named GROW, on Nov. 13, 2023. These grants are dedicated to developing organisational capacity, competitiveness, and sustainability in local and regional efforts. Recall that DUBAWA was among the early beneficiaries of the fund initiative in Oct. 2022 when the IFCN awarded the fact-checking organisation and ten others from eight countries about $450,000 in grants. According to Angie Drobnic Holan, IFCNs director, these grants are important in strengthening the global network of fact-checkers. Holan said, We are heartened by the diversity and innovation of the projects that fact-checking newsrooms have proposed that will increase the reach and impact of their work. The funded proposals include a diverse range of initiatives from around the globe. Rappler, a Philippine news organisation led by Nobel Peace Prize awardee Maria Ressa, is set to use the grant as seed money. At the same time, USA Today intends to combat misinformation in Spanish. Deutsche Presse-Agentur, from Germany, will use the grant to train fact-checkers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland on artificial intelligence (AI). The 2021 Myanmar coup prompted Mizzima to establish a fact-checking desk to counteract the surge in misinformation, and the grant will enable the organisations sustainability for its mission, including educating Myanmar citizens about media literacy. The GROW grants offer flexibility, allowing recipients to allocate funds for staffing, program expansion, initiatives to boost content visibility, training, fundraising, implementing data analytics tools, diversifying revenue streams, and fostering partnerships and collaborations. The full list of GROW recipients includes Africa Check (South Africa), Asocciacion de Periodismo de Investigacion Ojo Publico (Peru), Belarusian Investigative Centre (Belarus), BOOM (India), Demagog.cz (Czech Republic), FastCheck Lab (Hong Kong), Fountain ARIJ International (Jordan), Krik (Serbia), La Diaria (Uruguay), Laksmusz.hu (Hungary), and Les Surligneurs (France). Others are Maharat Foundation (Lebanon), Newtral (Spain), The Self-Investigation (the Netherlands), Vera Files (the Philippines), and Verify-Sy (Turkey). This announcement follows the initial BUILD phase, which granted funds to verified signatories of the IFCNs Code of Principles. The GROW phase expanded eligibility to non-signatory organizations, provided they had the endorsement of a verified signatory and their projects aimed to advance fact-checking efforts. Looking ahead to the third phase, the ENGAGE programme, scheduled to accept grant applications from Dec. 1 to Jan. 8, will focus on scaling local and regional audience engagement. The IFCN plans to conduct a question-and-answer session on Dec. 13 to address community queries regarding the ENGAGE grants.",1
"Claim: A Facebook post claimed that a Gambian boy had met the British Royal Family. Verdict: False. The claim that a Gambian boy has met the British Royal Family is false. A Google Reverse Image Search shows the picture was manipulated. On May 16, 2024, Whats On Gambia, a popular online outlet in The Gambia, posted a picture of the British Royal Family with a Gambian boy who claimed to have met the Royal Family and expressed gratitude to the reception. The video posted with the caption Gambian boy meets the British Royal Family generated over 1.3k comments, 16 shares, and 5.4k likes as of 18 May 2024. They were so nice. Very down-to-earth people. They know Serre Kunda, Banjul, Brikama, and Brusubi, the boy said. The comment section was inundated with different views, some suggesting the photo was real while others raised questions. One Facebook user, Dawda Jallow-DJ said, I can help you rearrange the photos better if you send them to me. This one has poor editing skills. Another user, Yahya Bojang, commented, Its wonderful to hear about positive interactions between people from different backgrounds. It sounds like they were genuinely interested in connecting with him personally, regardless of their royal status. This is a great part of the Gambian history, and congratulations, said Ebrima Badjan. One Sanneh Tapha commented, Take a good look at the photo, guys. Something is wrong. The smart ones will understand that I mean Similar images of the royal family were manipulated by different people as seen here , here , and here . DUBAWA decided to ascertain the pictures validity, which is gaining popularity on social media. A Google Reverse Image Search revealed that the picture of the British Royal Family has been manipulated several times. DUBAWA sighted the original picture, as posted by Dr Christopher Thomas on May 12, 2023, without manipulation. A casual examination of the image of the Gambian boy shows that the picture has been superimposed on the photograph of the British Royal Family. When DUBAWA checked major news and online platforms in The Gambia, there were no reports of the Gambian delegation visiting the British Royal family. The claim that a Gambian boy met the British Royal Family is fake; the picture was manipulated contrary to social media reports.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user claimed that a person in Dubai can order a helicopter ride via Uber. VERDICT: MISLEADING. A person in Dubai can only order a helicopter ride through UberChopper for a tour around the city. In 2015, Uber, a foremost ride-hailing global technology company, launched in Dubai. Since then, the company has expanded its transportation services to meet local demands across the city. Known for its luxurious lifestyle and modern infrastructure, the metropolis serves as a significant hub for Ubers operations in the Middle East. The citys growing economy and a high user penetration rate in ride-hailing services make it an ideal market for Ubers expansion efforts. A Facebook user, World Facts, claimed that a person living in Dubai can order a helicopter ride via Uber, a popular ride-hailing service, instead of a taxi. The post, made on Sept. 9, 2024, gained over 24,000 reactions, 460 comments and more than 3,000 reshares, as of Sept. 26, 2024. In the comment section, many people criticised their countries standard of living and praised Dubai for being prudent, while others expressed disbelief in the claim. The different opinions it generated prompted DUBAWA to fact-check the claim. Using a keyword search, DUBAWA found some services that Uber offers in Dubai. While UberX is the cost-effective option for everyday rides, UberFamily provides vehicles with child-car seats for transporting families with young children. Users interested in a 5-star experience can request UberBlack , the ride-hailing service exclusively offered by top-rated drivers of luxury cars, or UberOne , an eco-friendly electric car. UberChopper offers sightseeing tours of Dubai using helicopters. After booking, the 20-minute tour begins from the Atlantis helipad at the Palm Jumeirah. It conveys interested tourists to iconic landmarks in the city, such as Old Dubai, Downtown Dubai and Dubai Marina, all at specific prices. These conditions contradict the claim, which states that interested persons can Uber a helicopter instead of a taxi. While people can book helicopters through the app, it cannot offer taxi services as the claim stated. There are specific locations helicopters access exclusively for sightseeing. Therefore, the claim is misleading.",0
"Claim: Several accounts on TikTok and Facebook shared a video suggesting that the Vice President of Ghana was on stage singing a Chinese song. Verdict: The claim that Mahamudu Bawumia was singing a Chinese song is false. Our findings show the clip is a deepfake. In the democratic sphere, tarnishing individuals reputations through disinformation is a recurring issue, especially during elections. With Ghanas Dec. 7, 2024, election fast approaching, the countrys information ecosystem is increasingly vulnerable to misleading narratives, often aimed at discrediting political parties or figures. Mahamudu Bawumia (born on Oct. 7, 1963) is a Ghanaian politician and former central banker who serves as the 5th Vice President of Ghana in the 14th Ghanaian Republic. He assumed office on Jan. 7, 2017, as Vice President of Ghana and is the New Patriotic Party nominee for president in the 2024 general elections. Recently, some social media accounts shared a video suggesting that he was singing a Chinese song in front of a crowd. We first discovered the video on TikTok, shared by @onediamondug . The man identified as the Vice President of Ghana is heard saying, There is this Chinese song that I like, it goes this way. He then sings the song, followed by the artists original video. The post gained traction with 497,000 likes, 17,061 comments, 39,400 bookmarks, and 27,300 shares. In the comments, users like @Chocolateprince replied, Do they even know the meaning of the song? while @Ikraanfarxaan636 commented, Even if we dont know the meaning, we still love the song. @novasixcomedy added, Im sure he doesnt know the artist; he just knows the song. @Ejacstommy also said, Its even better than the original. Most people who commented believed Mahamudu Bawumia was the one in the footage. The same post was traced to different Facebook posts with the same narrative. See links here , here , here , and here . Given the virality of the post in the election season, DUBAWA decided to verify the claims authenticity. DUBAWA examined the video and observed several elements that doubt its authenticity. For instance, the lip-sync appeared misaligned, and when compared to another video of Bawumia speaking, the voice sounded noticeably different. Additionally, the audio quality seemed unusual, lacking the clarity typically found in other recordings. To verify further, DUBAWA attempted to analyse the video with Deepware.ai to determine its originality. However, due to the files corrupt natureoften a result of repeated alterationsan accurate analysis was not possible. DUBAWA went further to extract a screenshot from the video and used the forensic toolkit on InVid to detect signs of manipulation. An error analysis enhancer flagged the image as fabricated, confirming the suspicions about the videos authenticity. The original video was traced to a clip shared by Joy News on YouTube. The 38-second recording which was altered showed the Vice President in a humorous moment, gagging and laughing all through. All with no mention of a Chinese song. See the video here . After using various tools to assess the video, DUBAWA concluded that the content in question is a deepfake. The original footage was altered, with new elements superimposed to create a fabricated narrative.",0
"Claim: News report claims the president sacked the Central Bank governor. Our findings show President Muhammadu Buhari did not sack the Central Bank governor, Godwin Emefiele. Since information that Godwin Emefiele intends to run for president came into the public space, there have been calls for him to resign. Recently, President Muhammadu Buhari asked all appointed officers seeking political offices to resign . Although the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governor first denied his intention to run , he went ahead to ask a court to declare him eligible for the presidential ticket of any political party while serving as the governor. This was, however. recently withdrawn . Following this, a screenshot went viral on WhatsApp with the claim that the president had sacked the CBN governor. This was shared on a WhatsApp users WhatsApp status with the caption if this is true, then buhari did a very good job. The said screenshot has the headline BREAKING NEWS; Buhari sacks CBN governor, Godwin Emefiele. The screenshot has the byline Opinion Nigeria and it was shared on Wednesday May 25,2022. We first carried out a keyword search on the byline in the screenshot to find if the said report actually exists or the image was created. We found the website opinionnigeria.com and the news story on the governors sack was shared 12 hours ago. The story which linked this sack to the presidents order that appointed officers should resign noted that the president cannot unilaterally sack the governor. We however noticed that the story did not quote anybody or platform as its source. This is suspicious because an ideal news story always has and quotes a source.. Having found that this screenshot was from an actual report, we needed to establish if the president actually sacked Mr Emefiele, so we conducted a keyword search on google. This led to fact-checks by Daily Trust, and BBC , and news reports by Punch , ripples Nigeria etc . debunking this. We also found out that the Central Bank chief of Algeria, Rostom Fadli, was recently removed . This may have fueled the rumour in Nigeria. A keyword search on Twitter led to a news report by The Nation , which debunked this claim quoting the CBNs spokesman Osita Nwanisobi. A look at the CBNs website showed there was so far no release on the rumoured sack. The latest release on the website is on Tuesday, May 24, 2022 on a fire incident at its Makurdi branch. Seeing that the banks spokesperson was quoted by the news reports debunking the claim, DUBAWA went ahead to send an enquiry email to the bank because it was too late to put a phone call across. Also, a look at the Twitter handle of the presidents spokesperson, Garba Shehu , showed nothing of that nature. No press release or announcement about the governors rumoured sack. The state house website which publishes news on the presidencys recent activities also did not have any news of the rumoured sack. Our findings and news reports show that the claim that president Muhammadu Buhari sacked the CBN governor is false.",1
"Claim: A Facebook user posted an image to show the recent collapse of a school building in Jos. Verdict: Misleading! Findings revealed that the shared image was obtained from a 2013 incident in Kaduna. Over the years, many buildings have collapsed in Nigeria, but none seem to be as heart-wrenching as the recent one which claimed the lives of both teachers and pupils in Jos, Plateau State. While sympathising with the bereaved in her post, Prosperous Oluchi , a Facebook user, used an image to depict the incident scene. She wrote: Kia! A big school in Jos collapsed yesterday, and many kids lost their lives. Teachers lost their lives. Parents lost their children. Mother lost 4 kids hearing the news, she joined them, and here God kept me and you and our children why not call God a sweet name? I call him my great protector. Ms Oluchi is among several individuals who shared videos and images from the incident. Her image stood out as different from what others were posting, but no commentators questioned its authenticity. DUBAWA has noticed that when tragedies like this happen, users post misleading or, at times, false narratives on social media. This is why we sought to fact-check. We reverse-searched the image and found it had been online since 2013. Channels Television originally published it as linking to a building collapse in Kaduna on July 31, 2013. However, multiple outlets have since used this image to depict similar occurrences, as seen here , here , here , and here . The image posted by Ms Oluchi is unrelated to the collapse of the school building in Jos. The post is misleading.",0
"Claim: A Facebook user is spreading a claim on social media that the National Identity Management Commission is giving out five gigabytes of data and ten thousand naira as part of an alleged Verification Reward Programme. The programme is claimed to be for those who have been using a phone sim card for more than three months on any network. Dubawas finding reveals that the claim is just a scam emanating from a Facebook user. The claim was widely shared on WhatsApp. While the claim cannot be found on the website or any of the social media handles of the National Identity Management Commission, the media unit of the commission has refuted the claim, saying anyone who applies does so at his or her own risk. A Facebook cum WhatsApp message going virile on social media claims that the National Identity Management Commission, NIMC, is running a verification reward programme. The program is presumed to be for those who have been using their sim card for more than three months. The claim states that deadline for the application of the reward programme is 30th of September 2021. It urged interested applicants to click a link to apply for the reward. A click on the link led Dubawa to a page asking prospective applicants to click a check button to find out whether they are qualified for the alleged reward. A second click on the page led Dubawa to another page with an instruction to enter your phone number. This is to find out whether applicants phone numbers have been selected to be among the two thousand, four hundred customers selected to receive the award. The next click congratulated Dubawa and rolled out three steps to undergo to qualify. These include sending the link to twelve WhatsApp groups after which one will get the five gigabyte data and a sum of ten thousand naira within two minutes. These explains why it went viral with over five hundred shares, three hundred comments. It also had a like and love emoji from a Joseph and Monica Akinyi. One Ernest Zibkere in his comment acknowledged the credit of the data. Another comment from Lydia Chioma states I followed all the verification steps and after two minutes, I found out that my MTN increased by ten thousand. These are just a few among the comments running on the page. Since Dubawa was still verifying the authenticity of the claim, it did not click further to avoid spreading fake news. Screenshot of claim Dubawa started verification by visiting the website of the National Identity Management Commission and all its social media handles only to find out that there was no such claim on these platforms .A google search also revealed that no such claim existed. Dubawa finally put a call through to the NIMC media office where one of the commissions spokespersons, Hafsah Abdulrazaq, refuted the claim and rolled out a disclaimer: The message did not emanate from NIMC and we are not party to it. She added, Anyone who follows the link is at his own risk. Screenshot of NIMC scam alert It is not true that the National Identity Management Commission is running a verification reward programme. The two thousand and four hundred acclaimed winners are victims of a scam. All the social media handles and websites of NIMC do not advertise such a programme. And the media office of NIMC has also refuted the claim with a warning that whoever applies does so at his or her own risk.

"Claim: A Facebook user, Yekeh Kolubah, posted a picture on July 27, 2024, claiming that a boy in Nimba found a gemstone 395-carat diamond. Verdict: Photo Al-generated! A verification using illuminarty shows the Al probability of the image to be 58.6%. On July 27, 2024, a Facebook page purported to belong to Representative Yekeh Kolubah of District#10 of Montserrado County posted an image of a boy carrying a diamond. According to the poster, the lad is a resident of Sanniquilie, the capital city of Nimba. A little boy from Sanniquilie, Nimba County, Republic of Liberia found a gemstone of 395 carat value at over 4 million, the poster said. When writing this report, 395 reactions, 97 comments, and 29 shares were generated on the posts. In the comments, some users aligned with the poster, while others considered the information fake. A comment said, My seh too I na believe it yet. Im waiting. Screenshot below This controversy led DUBAWA to conduct a fact-check. DUBAWA visually analysed the image and found that parts were suspicious. For instance, the little boys fingers appeared disfigured, which gave a clue that the image may have been AI-generated. So, we used a tool, illuminarty, to determine whether artificial intelligence was used on the image. The search proved that the image is 58.6% Al-generated. Screenshot below We further discovered that the image originated from OpenArt through Google Reverse Image Search. OpenArt is an online artificial intelligence tool that is used to create photos and other content. The content on the image said, Poor kid in Africa finding diamond and picking it up in his hands looking impressive and amazing. It can be found here From our findings, the image is AI-generated and didnt come from Nimba as claimed.",1
"Claim: A TikTok user shared a video clip spotlighting Liverpool boss Arne Slot, slamming umpire Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby. Verdict: False. The TikTok video clip is a digitally altered version of an Australian-owned sports channel, Optus Sports, interview with Slot, in which he expressed pleasure in his sides triumph over Ipswich Town. Current Premier League leaders Liverpools 2-1 lead over derby rivals Everton was cut short when James Tarkowski scored a 98th-minute equaliser. Both sides squared up equal points after the game at Goodison Park. But the equaliser became a domino effect that sparked chaos when the final whistle blew. Liverpools Curtis Jones charged at Abdoulaye Doucoure, who had moved to the visitors stand to taunt them in celebration. Both players were punished with red cards but were not the only recipients on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. Michael Oliver also handed Liverpools head coach, Arne Slot, and assistant Sipke Hulshoff, red cards. This was just as the Dutchman had gripped Oliver in his direction in what was supposed to be a handshake and Slots seeming disapproval at the events of the last minutes. In the aftermath of the derby bedlam, a TikTok user, @veryscaryai , claimed via a video clip that Slot criticised Oliver, accusing the football umpire of receiving money from Evertons president and loathing Liverpool. I told Michael Oliver tonight to give me some of the money he made from the Everton president, and he showed me a red card. I dont know why he took offence to that, but we all know its true this dude hates Liverpool Slot was allegedly heard saying. The Dutchman further alleged Oliver was complacent about unprofessionalism. Yes, he is an awful ref. Everyone knows that. I saw him doing a knee slide when Everton tied the game at the end. It was shocking to see, the Reds coach allegedly said. As of Sunday, Feb. 16, 2025, the post has earned over 64,800 likes, 1,705 comments, 5020 bookmarks, and 11,400 shares. DUBAWA noticed a divide in the opinions expressed towards the post by other TikTok users. While some shared the same sentiments in the managers comments, others pointed out that the video clip had been digitally manipulated. FIFA should come out about Michael Oliver. He added (five) minutes and Liverpool (conceded) in (seven) minutes, Lubowa John757 expressed. No way this man (Slot) says this. This must be AI or something. RAJI viewed. Due to the divergent opinions and the sensitivity of the claim, DUBAWA decided to verify the videos authenticity. DUBAWA noticed both the Premier League and Liverpool logos on the background wallpaper in the area where Slot allegedly berates umpire Oliver. Apparently, it is set in Anfield Liverpools sports arena while the derby clash on Wednesday was played at Goodison Park (Evertons home). We conducted keyword searches on Google for post-match interviews that occurred at Anfield. We found some interview sessions with a background similar to that shared in the TikTok video clip. After scrutiny, DUBAWA found the interview setting showed the Liverpool manager answering questions in a context different from what was portrayed in the claimants post. In the original interview shared by Optus Sports, an Australian-based football streaming platform, on YouTube , Slot praised his teams side for being ruthless in their comfortable 4-1 victory against Premier League counterparts Ipswich Town on Jan 25, 2025. He further hoped his father was more enthralled at the game than when they had defeated Ligue 1 side Lille at the Champions League group stage three days before. I think he would. To be clear, he thought the little game wasnt as exciting as the other ones we played a week before. Because a week before, we had 37 shots on target, which was a record for an away team in the Premier League, Slot could be heard saying. And to be fair, Ipswich had a similar playing style to Lille. So it is not always easy to be exciting for us. But with us scoring four goals, I assume he finds it more exciting than the little game, the Dutchman said of his father about his games. Another prominent feature in both videos is the Liverpool managers active gesticulations, as his body language portrays the emotions in his words. But more importantly, these gesticulations are similar in the interview by Optus Sports and the TikTok video clip a bemused smile plastered on his face, the relaxed raising of eyelids, shrugging of shoulders, and a confident nodding of the head. However, Optus Sport posted the interview session on Jan 25, 2025, three weeks before the TikTok user shared the video clip. Besides, when Oliver disciplined Slot with a red card, it cost the latter the privilege of sharing his side of the incident with the press because Premier League rules instruct that any player, coach, or manager sanctioned with a red card would be debarred from participating in the post-match interview. Consequently, there was no way the Liverpool manager would have indulged in interview sessions after the match. When he talked to the press the next morning , he was somewhat remorseful about the incident, mentioning that emotions got the better of me. We subjected the video to deepwareai , but it detected no deepfake material. Careful analysis of the video clip shows it has been digitally altered from its original version.",0
"Claim:The Kano State Government, through the Commissioner for Information, has denied stories widely reported across media platforms that Kanos powerful First Lady, Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, popularly known as Goggo had anointed the State Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo, aka Commander as successor to her husband claiming she was quoted out of context and had only commended his performance A content analysis of the video footage where the Kano state first lady, Hajiya Hafsat Ganduje made the statement including a careful observation of her disposition, length of time she took in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government. The state governments claim therefore is MISLEADING. The Kano state government has refuted reports attributed to the First Lady, Prof. Hafsat Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in which she is reported to have endorsed Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023. In a statement issued by the state commissioner for information, Malam Muhammad Garba, the State government explained that the governors wife was quoted out of contest in the trending video clip on the social media platform. In the video, the statement added, the First Lady was only thrilled by Garos performance whom she fondly called Commander and for his support for the policies and programmes of Governor Ganduje and his administration in the state. Recently, media reports were rife that the First lady popularly known as Goggo has at a function in Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano State on Saturday while addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme, said Murtala Garo is the ideal person to succeed their government as he posses all the needed attributes. Recall that in the 2019 gubernatorial election, Mr. Garo allegedly disrupted the process by tearing result sheets at Nasarawa Polling Unit of the State which led to the declaration of the election inconclusive. Garo was arrested by police officers alongside chairman of the Nasarawa LGA Lamin Sani and the state Deputy Governor Nasiru Gawuna for allegedly storming the collation centre and destroying election results sheets. The commissioner, who was almost stripped naked in the fracas, was reportedly beaten to pulp together with his accomplices before being arrested. They were detained at the state police command headquarters in Bompai area and interrogated before they were released on bail. The police command under then CP Mohammed Wakili, nicknamed Singham, vowed to prosecute Garo and Sani but his tenure did not last longer. A content analysis of the video footage where the first lady, Professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje popularly known as Goggo made the statement reveals that she was addressing government officials and beneficiaries of an empowerment programme at Ungogo Local Government Area of Kano state and she had spoken at length in praise of the Commissioner for Local Government Affairs, Murtala Sule Garo who was nicknamed Commander after the election disruption debacle. In her own words, the first lady had said, what the governor wants is educated, agile, and hardworking young men to steer the affairs of our Local Governments. He also wants hardworking youths to succeed him. I remember, while on a short trip. At all times He is here listening to me, in every battle, there has to be a Commander (Mr. Garos nickname) had spent sleepless nights. I swear to God, he didnt sleep because he was working hard to discharge his responsibility as a commissioner. I hope you chairmen are listening to me? You are hearing this from Goggos mouth. Therefore, these are the people that His Excellency said they would succeed him , Mrs Ganduje said. A careful observation of her disposition, length of time taken in making her point and her statement as translated reveals that she was not quoted out of context as claimed by the Kano State Government. Commenting on the matter, Musa Sani Alyu, a broadcast Journalist with Jalla radio 98.1FM Kano said, What happened was that Goggo spilled the beans. What is on the mind is what is on the face. What the first lady said at the event was very clear and it is directly proportional to the state governments intention. We all know she is one of the most influential people in the government, that is the reason they opened an office for her, the office of the wife of Kano State governor, which did not happen in Kano prior to now. What Goggo said, the inclination has shown thats whats on her mind and she wants him to be the candidate because he is her puppet. Everyone knows the depth of his loyalty to the first lady. So she was clear enough and they tried as much to retract the anointment but the damage had already been done. As a broadcast journalist in Kano, i carefully follow all the news and i am much interested in the affairs of Kano state government and i know the first lady meant what she said. Lets wait till 2023 you will see unexpected things happening especially on gubernatorial candidates . Also commenting, Nura Yusuf, a Kano based public affairs commentator said, Goggo could not hide her emotions anytime it comes to Sule Garo because If he hadnt played the role he played at the Nassarawa collation center during the 2019 gubernatorial elections, there would be no Ganduje government today. The state governments claim is just damage control because it was obvious some forces within the party were upset on the issue that was why they brought something that will whitewash the statement, Another commentator, Salis Mohammad Manaja, a political analyst observed that the story was not debunked until about two days after when the issue started generating rancour within the party. They did that to control the internal crisis emanating within the government, it would have been better if the government had claimed that the first lady preempted the situation rather than denying what is obvious from the clip we saw , Manager said. Arguments by the commentators are consistent with the image repair theory in crisis communication, a subspecialty of the public relations profession which is designed to protect and defend an individual or organisation facing reputational challenges. The image repair theory (IRT), recommended by Professor William Benoit, a scholar in the field of political communication, University of Missouri , identifies five general approaches to responding to accusations or suspicions. These are Denial, Evading Responsibility, Reducing Offensiveness, Corrective Action, and Mortification. Based on content analysis of the video footage of the subject matter, and arguments from public affairs commentators, claims by the Kano State government that the first lady, professor Hafsat Umar Ganduje did not endorse Murtala Sule Garo, commissioner for local government and chieftaincy affairs as successor to her husband come 2023, is MISLEADING.

"Claim: A Facebook video shows a man alleging that Michelle Obama is a man. Verdict: FALSE! The pictures used to portray her as masculine are fake, and the video of her husband calling her Micheal was taken out of context. First Lady Michelle Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th American President, Barack Obama. She is the pioneer African-American First Lady of the United States. Ms Obama is well known as an advocate for healthy families , service members families, higher education , and international adolescent girls education. A Facebook user, Songasmangit Alkebulan , posted a video of a man saying that Ms Obama is transgender and that her real name is Micheal. He captioned the video with: Obama accidentally exposing himself and Michelle (Michael), as a transgender, the last woman saying Michelle was a trans was found murdered lately, we are in the age of hidden agenda exposed. In the almost two-minute video , different pictures and videos showed significant differences in Ms Obamas body. The song in the background said, How come anyone notices her private parts in her pictures. The video that has gone viral has garnered 3,300 likes and 1,900 shares since it was posted. The virality of this post and the personalities involved made us run a fact check. We did an advanced Google search and saw that the claim is recurring. It was first posted on August 18, 2018, when Mr Obama was running for president of the United States. The post also shows a video of Mr Obama making a speech at the Change of Office Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Ceremony, where he said Micheal and I. We watched the video from the beginning and saw that he was referring to Micheal, an admiral present at the ceremony. In the transcripted version of the video on the official website of Mr Obama, he said, Most of all, Admiral Mullen, Deborah, Michael, and I also want to acknowledge your son Jack, whos deployed today. This shows that the video was taken out of context. We also found out that all the videos used to depict the masculinity of Ms Obama were edited using the image of men. The actual pictures of Ms Obama are in the Barack Obama Presidential Library . The post shared on Facebook, which said that the woman that said Michelle was trans died mysteriously, is false. Our investigation shows that the woman was Joan Rivers and died of low blood oxygen during a routine medical procedure to check out voice changes and reflux. Our findings show that Ms Obama is not transgender; all the pictures used to portray her as one are fake. We also discovered that the video of her husband calling her Micheal was taken out of context.",0
"Claim: A TikTok video , which has been widely circulated on social media, suggests that some Ghanaian police confiscated ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers. The claim is misleading. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken in 2019 in Ghana during a collision on Techiman-Kumasi road involving a Bank of Ghana bullion van and a fuel tanker. The video has nothing to do with kidnappers from Nigeria and the accompanying claim is misleading. In Nigeria, terror gangs, popularly called bandits, kidnap people for ransom. Demand for ransom is now on the rise and has become an illicit, but lucrative business for terrorists across Nigeria. Leveraging on this, some social media users have started circulating a TikTok video to suggest that Ghaninan police seized the ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers. The TikTok video was captioned, Ghana police intercepted billions of naira being smuggled out of Nigeria by bandits. In a close observation of the video , DUBAWA discovers that there were several crates, containing what looked like bank notes, scattered on a road. A blue van and white fuel tanker were also visible in the video, as well as armed security officials. When DUBAWA read through the comments, it was discovered that there was confusion among social media users. While some believe the video has something to do with Nigeria, some queried the source of the video. To avoid further confusion, and to set the record straight, DUBAWA decides to check the accuracy of the video being circulated. DUBAWA conducted a frame-by-frame analysis of the video on the InVid Video verification tool. Results from the analysis show that the earliest version of the video was uploaded on a YouTube channel called Chasm TV on 5th October 2019. The earliest version of the video was captioned: Money scattered after Bank of Ghana bullion van collided with a tanker. Going through the 29-second video, DUBAWA observed that the video was identical to the one being circulated to portray the confiscation of ransom money by Nigerian kidnappers. Keywords like Ghana bullion van collided with a tanker took DUBAWA to a report p u blished by Ghanaian media on the crash. Media organizations, like Joy Online , Pulse Ghana , and Within Nigeria also published the crash. The report which was captioned: Cash flows after BoG bullion van collides with fuel tanker; one confirmed dead (video), explained that the video showed a collision on Techiman-Kumasi road in Ghana, involving a Bank of Ghana bullion van and a fuel tanker. According to the repo rt, the crash which took place on 4th September 2019 led to the death of one person, while several others sustained serious injuries. The report partly reads, A joint team of the Military, Police, Fire Service, Immigration and the Bureau of National Investigation (BNI) cordoned off the crash scene and collected the scattered money into various security vehicles. Monies from the scene of the crash will be kept at the Police Divisional Headquarters cells under the guard of the Military, Police and Bank of Ghana security officers. The TikTok video suggesting that some Ghanaian police confiscated ransom money being smuggled into the country by Nigerian kidnappers is misleading. DUBAWA discovered that the video was taken in 2019 in Ghana during a collision on Techiman-Kumasi road involving a Bank of Ghana bullion van and a fuel tanker. The video has nothing to do with Nigerian kidnappers.",0
